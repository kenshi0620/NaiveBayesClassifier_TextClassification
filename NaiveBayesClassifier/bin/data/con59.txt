reported
An
open-air
burn
pit
at
Joint
Base
Balad
the
largest
US
base
in

may
have
exposed

Health

from

were
discussed
in

at

he
told
the

You
couldn't
get
away
with
this
kind
of

disposal
in

Brown
went
on
to
say
the

has
already
heard
concerns
about

from

say

I
would

the

would

By

USA
TODAY
WASHINGTON
Dan
Cooper
a
proud
member
of
the
National
Rifle
Association
has
backed
Republicans
for
most
of
his
life
He's
the
chief
executive
of
Cooper
Arms
a
small
Montana
company
that
makes
hunting
rifles
Cooper
said
he
voted
for
George
W
Bush
in
2000
having
voted
in
past
elections
for
every
Republican
presidential
nominee
back
to
Richard
Nixon
In
October
1992
he
presented
a
specially
made
rifle
to
the
first
President
Bush
during
a
Billings
campaign
event
This
year
Cooper
has
given
3,300
to
the
campaign
of
Democrat
Barack
Obama
That's
on
top
of
the
1,000
check
he
wrote
to
Obama's
U.S
Senate
campaign
in
2004
after
he
was
dazzled
by
Obama's
speech
at
that
year's
Democratic
National
Convention
Then
there's
this
Heh
I
guess
Mr
Cooper
didn't
maintain
a
majority
interest
in
the
firm
or
something
I
can
see
how
the
Board
and
Shareholders
might
consider
public
support
of
a
candidate
known
for
views
not
merely
restrictive
but
in
fact
prohibitive
of
despite
campaign
rhetoric
to
the

here
is
one
As

left
open
by
a
Recon
unit's
hasty
departure
many
rear

themselves
in
close

combat
The
fights
were
short
and
nasty
A
field

unit
was
caught
up
in
one
of
these
fights
and
after
the
initial
contact
the
unit
attempted
to
escape
the
onrushing

were

evading

input
this

from
The
Flea
taken
from
the
middle
of
the
piece
When
We
Fought
Smart
over
at
Free
Republic
And
this
is
understandable
since
most
of
the
press
are
morons
They
haven't
a
clue
as
to
the
complexity
and
the
sheer
enormity
of
the
task
of
moving
even
a
single
armored
division
half
way
around
the
world
to
say
nothing
of
several
Corps
A
70
ton
main
battle
tank
isn't
parachuted
out
of
the
back
of
a
C-47
fully
armed
and
fueled
and
with
the
tank
crew
inside
gloriously
shouting
Geronimo
The
months
necessary
to
move
an
entire
division
of
these
tanks
their
ammunition
requirements
and
fuel
to
actually
maneuver
these
thirsty
monsters
as
well
as
the
colossal
spares
and
maintenance
stores
are
all
part
of
an
arcane
science
known
as
logistics
This
science
is
seldom
taught
in
liberal
arts
colleges
Nor
apparently
is
which
end
of
the
gun
the
little
bullet
thingy
comes
out
of
There
isn't
time
what
with
all
the
cosmetics
classes
and
political
science
As
such
the
months
necessary
to
effect
such
translocations
as
well
as
the
planning
and
available
shipping
bottoms
to
carry
the
massive
cargoes
are
as
unknown
and
mystifying
to
the
press
as
other
bizarre
concepts
like
patriotism
and
duty
The
idea
that
a
rapid
reaction
force
must
necessarily
be
lightly-armed
isn't
important
to
them
or
even
interesting
What
IS
important
is
exactly
where
the
press
dines
and
why
no
white
linen
is
available
for

An
old
joke
but
what
the
heck
this
is
the
Internet
it's
new
to
someone
Difference
between
Officers
and
NCOs
A
young
Marine
officer
was
severely
wounded
in
the
head
by
a
grenade
but
the
only
visible
permanent
injury
was
to
both
of
his
ears
which
were
amputated
Since
his
hearing
wasn't
impaired
he
remained
in
the
Marine
Corps
Many
years
later
he
eventually
rose
to
the
rank
of
major
general
He
was
however
very
sensitive
about
his
appearance
One
day
the
general
was
interviewing
three
Marines
prospects
for
his
headquarters
staff
The
first
was
an
aviator
captain
and
it
was
a
great
interview
At
the
end
of
the
interview
the
general
asked
him
Do
you
notice
anything
different
about
me
The
young
officer
answered
Why
yes
sir
I
couldn't
help
but
notice
that
you
have
no
ears
The
general
got
very
angry
at
his
lack
of
tact
and
threw
him

Once
upon
a
time,I
really
believed
that
politics
were
for
other
people
Old
men
in
particular
But
more
specifically
people
who
have
been
in
politics
for
a
long
time
Careerists
Not
for
the
regular
people
As
importantly
politicians
and
political
issues
seemed
far
away
something
that
I
had
little
ability
to
impact
Blogging
has
given
me
some
outlet
to
express
opinions
and
share
ideas
with
others
but
impact
or
effect
on
actual
political
issues
is
unmeasurable
So
even
having
become
somewhat
of
a
political
junky
I
still
did
not
imagine
that
your
average
citizen
had
real
capability
to
change
things
or
have
a
voice
besides
the
ballot
box
What
changed
my
opinion
about
my
place
in
politics

skewering
CBS

for
some
well
what

CYA
That
CYA

refers
to
CBS
not
Tigerhawk
btw
It
is
remarkable
that
CBS
News
would
run
a
report
even
this
critical
of
Barack
Obama
even
this
late
in
the
election
cycle
Too
late
to
make
a
difference
but
early
enough
to
allow
CBS
to
claim
it
was
fair
to
John
McCain
It
is
remarkable
that
this
story
had
to
be
broken
by
bloggers
and
their
readers
but
entirely
unremarkable
that
CBS
News
made
no
mention
of
that
fact
Ayup
the
Armorer
Gates
Reflects
on
Service
as
Wartime
Defense
Secretary
It
helps
that
they
want
to
go
he
said
They
see
the
challenge
They
want
to
go
They
want
to
fight
the
fight
They
want
to
win
the
fight
So
one
of
the
things
that
helps
me
deal
with
the
fact
that
I
am
sending
them
into
harm's
way
is
to
do
every
damn
thing
I
can
to
give
them
everything
they
need
to
win
and
to

rather

for

in
it's
politics
when
the
party
in
power
changed
that
caused
confusion
rather
than
clarified

So
I
tried
again
and
decided
what
the

I
typed
all
that
once
why
not
use
it
over
here

here

I
was

I

and
a
hope

hard
to
get
myself
into
the
States
What
do
I
do
now
Princess

If
you
believed
an
incident
such
as
this
could
change
your
mind
then
you
really
weren't
supporting
OIF/OEF
for
the
right
reasons

pro-choice

pro-equal

pro-environmental

pro-public

who
supported
and

I

Did
I

where
it
was

were
Uncle

never
went
through

to
bring
his

and
what
use
was
it
voting

I
can't
just

Where
are
we
Canada
President
Bush
on
terrorists
in
Iraq
They
can't
whip
our
militaries
What
they
can
do
is
get
on
your
TV
screens
and
stand
in
front
of
your
TV
cameras
and
cut
somebody's
head
off
in
order
to
try
to
cause
us
to
cringe
and
retreat
That's
their
strongest
weapon

Time

I

want

these

who

and
then
decided
they
didn't
want
to

by
the
rules
they
agreed
to
I'd
have
a

more
time
for
them
if
they
decided
to
make
their
stand
without
turning
tail
and
without
abandoning
their
oaths
and
their
comrades

I

their

are
better
off
without
them
