PHILS
WIN
I
would
have
preferred
to
watch
it
somewhere
other
than
a
hotel
room
in
Huntsville
Alabama
but
you
can't
have
it
all
I
enjoyed
their
run
The
better
team
won
and
almost
all
of
it
will
be
back
next
year
The
possible
exceptions
PAT
BURRELL
32
made
14m
this
year
250
33
HR
86
RBI
He
was
Clubber
Lang
in
the
spring
then
cooled
off
considerably
for
the
second
half
and
was
ice
cold
in
the
WS
until
leading
off
with
a
double
that
became
the
winning
run
He
is
unbelievably
slow
and
usually
gets
replaced
in
the
late
innings
for
defense
He
failed
to
get
to
a
shallow
fly
ball
in
the
first
inning
of
one
of
the
WS
games
that
I
bet
any
other
left
fielder
would
have
caught
I
think
the
Phils
will
make
him
an
offer
designed
for
him
to
refuse
One
thing
I
do
really
like
about
Burrell
is
that
he
has
developed
an
excellent
eye
at
the
plate
and
takes
a
lot
of
walks
I
remember
listening
to
one
game
where
Burrell
and
fellow
slowpoke
Ryan
Howard
both
had
triples
in
the
same
game
That
I
think
was
as
big
a
statistical
anomaly
as
you
could
find
in
baseball
this
year
Burrell
batting
5th
does
provide
a
longball
threat
that
makes
managers
pitch
to
Howard
batting
4th
but
I
think
the
Phillies
will
conclude
and
I
agree
that
there
are
better
ways
to
spend
that
money
JAMIE
MOYER
45
made
5.5m
and
recorded
16
wins
He
is
a
Philly
area
native
and
wants
to
finish
his
career
with
his
hometown
team
I
think
he
will
He
is
also
sort
of
a
player-coach
to
the
younger
pitchers
on
their
staff
The
only
other
unrestricted
free
agents
of
note
are
LHP
SCOTT
EYRE
and
reserve
outfielder
SO
TAGUCHI
Eyre
was
acquired
mid-season
from
the
Cubs
He
contributed
and
will
probably
get
a
better
offer
somewhere
else
Taguchi
was
useless
and
rarely
saw
an
AB
toward
the
end
of
the
season
No
offer
forthcoming
There
are
10
players
who
will
be
eligible
for
arbitration
and
many
of
them
will
get
huge
raises
Howard
10
million
Hamels
500,000
centre-fielder
Shane
Victorino
480,000
right-fielder
Jayson
Werth
1.7
million
starter
Joe
Blanton
3.7
million
and
relievers
Ryan
Madson
1.4
million
and
Chad
Durbin
900,000
should
make
a
lot
more
money
next
year
The
Phillies
payroll
on
opening
day
was
104.5
million
Keeping
it
close
to
that
total
for
09
will
be
a
challenge
The
Phils
sold
out
more
than
60
home
dates
this
year
Their
bank
account
is
bursting
but
they
are
well
known
for
not
overpaying
players
They
got
some
real
bargains
this
year
with
Hamels
Victorino
Madson
Durbin
and
Werth
I
found
myself
under-excited
about
the
Phillies
championship
celebration
I
followed
them
this
year
and
really
liked
the
team
and
went
to
several
games
but
they
are
my
adopted
team
not
my
birth
team
and
I
didn't
get
the
burst
of
joy
that
is
supposed
to
come
when
your
guys
jump
all
over
each
other
on
the
mound
If
I
had
to
buy
a
ball
cap
today
it
would
be
a
Pirates
cap
They
are
expecting
the
largest-ever
sports
parade
in
the
US
today
in
Philly
The
parade
route
stretches
several
miles
from
center
city
down
Broad
Street
to
one
final
revenuefest
at
Citizens
Bank
Park
My
wife
wanted
to
take
the
boys
but
thought
better
of
it
when
I
told
her
how
many
people
are
expected
how
full
the
trains
are
how
much
trouble
she
would
have
getting
home
and
that
the
route
was
already
well
lined
with
fans
during
my
drive
time
this
morning
Parade
starts
at
noon
We
also
have
the
small
problem
that
our
younger
son
has
a
bad
habit
of
wandering
off
in
crowds
like
Curious
George
She
watched
2-1/2
hours
of
postgame
celebration
coverage
after
Game
5
while
I
was
fast
asleep
She
is
really
into
it
It's
cute

POLITICAL
MEME
Reason

asked
their
writers
these
questions
Give
it
a
go
Junto
Boys
Here
are
my
answers
1
Who
are
you
voting
for
in
November
McCain/Palin
I
was
leaning
Bob
Barr
all
summer
but
the
Palin
selection
changed
my
mind
She's
the
only
candidate
in
the
race
that
thinks
America
exists
somewhere
outside
the
beltway
2
Who
did
you
vote
for
in
2004
and
2000
Bush
Both
times
I
regret
his
expansion
of
government
but
we
did
get
two
great
Supreme
Court
justices
after
some
prodding
3
Is
this
the
most
important
election
in
your
lifetime
I
think
it
may
be
among
the
least
important
Bush
losing
in
2004
would
have
meant
a
leftist
majority
on
the
court
and
the
great
skedaddle
from
the
Middle
East
Reagan
losing
in
1980
would
have
meant
a
cut
in
cold
war
defense
spending
that
could
have
let
the
Russians
save
their
economy
Who
knows
maybe
the
Berlin
Wall
would
still
be
standing
4
What
will
you
miss
about
the
Bush
administration
The
Tax
Cuts
5
Leaving
George
W
Bush
out
of
consideration
what
former
U.S
president
would
you
most
like
to
have
waterboarded
and
why
Lyndon
Johnson
for
making
the
government
responsible
for
too
much
while
solving
nary
a
problem

SIGN
STEALING
I
had
my
sign
stolen
over
the
weekend
so
this
was
fun
to
read
After
Shawn
Turschak
saw
two
sets
of
McCain-Palin
signs
disappear
from
his
yard
within
hours
of
being
planted
he
took
steps
to
protect
the
latest
pair
On
Monday
he
ran
wires
from
his
house
and
hooked
the
signs
into
a
power
source
for
an
electric
pet
fence
Then
he
mounted
a
surveillance
camera
in
a
nearby
tree
and
wired
it
to
a
digital
recorder
Tuesday
afternoon
the
camera
saw
this
A
neighbor
trotting
up
with
an
Obama-Biden
sign
grabbing
a
handful
of
volts
as
he
touched
a
McCain-Palin
sign
then
fleeing
at
top
9-year-old
boy
speed
A
few
minutes
later
the
boy's
father
Andrew
Noble
was
at
Turschak's
door
demanding
an
explanation
from
Turschak's
13-year-old
daughter
who
called
her
parents
on
the
phone
to
say
a
man
was
yelling
at
her
Both
families
agree
on
one
aspect
of
the
exchange
that
Noble
chastised
her
for
electrocuting
his
son
then
left
His
son
electrocuted
himself
I
wish
I
had
thought
of
it
Didn't
parents
use
to
get
mad
at
their
children
for
mischief
Now
they
seem
to
be
behind
it

ECONOMY
EXPLAINED
USING
BEER
Our
old
friend
Scott
Johnson
emailed
this
to
me
this
morning
It's
long
but
explains
the
point
better
than
any
member
of
the
media
Suppose
that
everyday
ten
men
go
out
for
beer
and
the
bill
for
all
ten
comes
to
100
If
they
paid
their
bill
the
way
we
pay
our
taxes
it
would
go
something
like
this
The
first
four
men
the
poorest
would
pay
nothing
The
fifth
would
pay
1
The
sixth
would
pay
3
The
seventh
would
pay
7
The
eighth
would
pay
12
The
ninth
would
pay
18
The
tenth
man
the
richest
would
pay
59
So
that's
what
they
decided
to
do
The
ten
men
drank
in
the
bar
every
day
and
seemed
quite
happy
with
the
arrangement
until
one
day
the
owner
threw
them
a
curve
Since
you
are
all
such
good
customers
he
said
I'm
going
to
reduce
the
cost
of
your
daily
beer
by
20.'Drinks
for
the
ten
now
cost
just
80
The
group
still
wanted
to
pay
their
bill
the
way
we
pay
our
taxes
so
the
first
four
men
were
unaffected
They
would
still
drink
for
free
But
what
about
the
other
six
men
the
paying
customers
How
could
they
divide
the
20
windfall
so
that
everyone
would
get
his
fair
share
They
realized
that
20
divided
by
six
is
3.33
But
if
they
subtracted
that
from
everybody's
share
then
the
fifth
man
and
the
sixth
man
would
each
end
up
being
paid
to
drink
his
beer
So
the
bar
owner
suggested
that
it
would
be
fair
to
reduce
each
man's
bill
by
roughly
the
same
amount
and
he
proceeded
to
work
out
the
amounts
each
should
pay
And
so
The
fifth
man
like
the
first
four
now
paid
nothing
100
savings
The
sixth
now
paid
2
instead
of
3
33%savings
The
seventh
now
pay
5
instead
of
7
28%savings
The
eighth
now
paid
9
instead
of
12
25
savings
The
ninth
now
paid
14
instead
of
18
22
savings
The
tenth
now
paid
49
instead
of
59
16
savings
Each
of
the
six
was
better
off
than
before
And
the
first
four
continued
to
drink
for
free
But
once
outside
the
restaurant
the
men
began
to
compare
their
savings
I
only
got
a
dollar
out
of
the
20,'declared
the
sixth
man
He
pointed
to
the
tenth
man
but
he
got
10
Yeah
that's
right
exclaimed
the
fifth
man
I
only
saved
a
dollar
too
It's
unfair
that
he
got
ten
times
more
than
I
That's
true
shouted
the
seventh
man
Why
should
he
get
10
back
when
I
got
only
two
The
wealthy
get
all
the
breaks
Wait
a
minute
yelled
the
first
four
men
in
unison
We
didn't
get
anything
at
all
The
system
exploits
the
poor
The
nine
men
surrounded
the
tenth
and
beat
him
up
The
next
night
the
tenth
man
didn't
show
up
for
drinks
so
the
nine
sat
down
and
had
beers
without
him
But
when
it
came
time
to
pay
the
bill
they
discovered
something
important
They
didn't
have
enough
money
between
all
of
them
for
even
half
of
the
bill
And
that
boys
and
girls
journalists
lawyers
and
college
professors
is
how
our
tax
system
works
The
people
who
pay
the
highest
taxes
get
the
most
benefit
from
a
tax
reduction
Tax
them
too
much
attack
them
for
being
wealthy
and
they
just
may
not
show
up
anymore
In
fact
they
might
start
drinking
overseas
where
the
atmosphere
is
somewhat
friendlier

James
Buchanan
1857-61
Democratic
Failed

prevent
the
near
disintegration
of
the
nation
41
Franklin

1853-57
Democratic
Pierce
was
one
of
the
few
presidents
to
be
abandoned
by
his
own
party
after
a
single
term.40
Martin
Van
Buren
1837-41
Democratic
It
is
hard
to
place
high
up
on
the
list
those
who
sanctioned
the
slaughter
of
Native
Americans
39
William
Harrison
1841
Whig
Harrison
only
lasted
32
days
as
President
so
our
panel
struggled
to
push
him
very
far
up
the
table.37T
Richard
Nixon
1969-74
Republican
Cynical
manipulation
bringing
the
presidency
into
disrepute
and
changing
the
language
to
the
extent
that
even
a
whiff
of
scandal
merits
the
suffix
gate
37T
George
W
Bush
2001-2009
Republican
Bush
Jr
invaded
Iraq
based
on
faulty
intelligence
and
then
catastrophically
mismanaged
the
war
dragging
America's
name
through
the
mud."36
Herbert
Hoover
1929-33
Republican
Unwittingly
turned
the
1929
crash
into
a
global
depression
which
weakened
democracies
and
prepared
the
ground
for
the
Second
World
War
34T
Warren

Headed
one
of
the
most
corrupt
administrations."34T
James

The
second
shortest
Presidency
after
William

32
days

the

still
prefers
him
to
Nixon.33
Millard
Fillmore
1850-53
Whig
Created
a
compromise
on
extending
slavery
that
laid
the
ground
for
the
US
Civil
War."32
Jimmy
Carter
1977-81
Democratic
Carter
got
just
about
everything
wrong."31
John
Tyler
1841-45
Whig
Tyler
assumed
the
presidency
after
a
brief
constitutional
crisis
following
the
sudden
death
of
William
Harrison
He
had
been
the
Vice
President
and
from
this
moment
all
VPs
were
a
heartbeat
away
from
the
White
House
He
struggled
to
assert
his
authority
and
his
presidency
was
often
referred
to
as
his
accidency
29T
William
H
Taft
1909-13
Republican
Taft's
Presidency
was
overshadowed
by
the
imposing
figure
of
Theodore
Roosevelt
Teddy
had
anointed
his
friend
as
his
successor
before
changing
his
mind
after
Taft's
first
term
and
making
an
acrimonious
but
failed
challenge
to
his
Republican
nomination.29T
Benjamin
Harrison
1889-93
Republican
For
the
first
time
outside
of
war
Congress
was
allowed
to
spend
a
billion
dollars
which
was
not
welcomed
by
the
impoverished
electorate.28
Zachary
Taylor
1849-50
Whig
Taylor
is
another
man
to
languish
in
the
rankings
due
at
least
in
part
to
a
brief
presidency.27
Rutherford
B
Hayes
1877-81
Republican
Hayes
election
was
the
most
controversial
of
all
He
comfortably
lost
the
popular
vote
but
after

Calvin

ever
to

Republican
His

in

The
LA
Times
refuses
release
the
tape
It
seems
increasingly
true
that
Chicago
style
politics
has
morphed
from
being
merely
corrupt
to
being
quite
radically
anti-American
Chicago
is
not
Obama's
hometown
but
a
place
he
chose
and
feel's
comfortable
with
He
wasn't
a
crusader
for
change
there
As
measured
as
he
is
in
discourse
his
political
roots
are
with
one
shady
character
after
another
These
people
from
his
past
do
not
fit
the
narrative
the
press
has
written
about
Obama
and
Obama's
involvement
with
these
people
is
treated
as
peripheral
part
of
his
rise
But
who
are
the
moderates
in
Chicago
that
were
a
bigger
influence
on
him
And
if
Obama
was
not
an
agent
for
change
in
Chicago
isn't
it
possible
that
the
Chicago
model
is
what
he
wants
to
bring
to
America
The
media
doesn't
seem
the
least
bit
interested
in
how
Obama
might
actually
govern
outside
of
the
flowery
talk
we
get
on
the
campaign
trail
This
latest
example
of
his
anti-American
associates
brings
nothing
but
a
yawn
to
the
media
who
wants
to
pin
Ted
Stevens
to
Sarah
Palin
Palin's
name
is
listed
on
2003
incorporation
papers
of
the
Ted
Stevens
Excellence
in
Public
Service
Inc
a
527
group
that
could
raise
unlimited
funds
from
corporate
donors
Palin's
relationship
with
Alaska's
senior
senator
may
be
one
of
the
more
complicated
aspects
of
her
new
position
as
Sen
John
McCain's
running
mate
Stevens
was
indicted
in
July
2008
on
seven
counts
of
corruption
Palin
an
anti-corruption
crusader
in
Alaska
had
called
on
Stevens
to
be
open
about
the
issues
behind
the
investigation
But
she
also
held
a
joint
news
conference
with
him
in
July
before
he
was
indicted
to
make
clear
she
had
not
abandoned
him
politically
Stevens
had
been
helpful
to
Palin
during
her
run
for
governor
swooping
in
with
a
last
moment
endorsement
And
the
two
filmed
a
campaign
commercial
together
to
highlight
Stevens's
endorsement
of
Palin
during
the
2006
race
But
Stevens
is
exactly
like
Old
Man
Daley
from
Chicago
merely
corrupt
without
being
anti-American
Why
is
he
such
a
big
story
And
between
Palin
and
Obama
who
has
stood
up
to
that
kind
of
corruption
Palin
has
not
been
shown
to
have
gained
personally
from
Stevens
corruption
but
their
relationship
remains
complicated
to
the
press
Take
Tony
Rezko
the
least
anti-American
of
Obama's
shady
associations
The
Chicago
Sun
Times
goes
to
pains
to
let
Obama
off
the
hook
in
the
relationship
A
few
months
after
Obama
became
a
U.S
senator
he
and
Rezko's
wife
Rita
bought
adjacent
pieces
of
property
from
a
doctor
in
Chicago's
Kenwood
neighborhood
a
deal
that
has
dogged
Obama
the
last
two
years
The
doctor
sold
the
mansion
to
Obama
for
1.65
million
300,000
below
the
asking
price
Rezko's
wife
paid
full
price
625,000
for
the
adjacent
vacant
lot
The
deals
closed
in
June
2005
Six
months
later
Obama
paid
Rezko's
wife
104,500
for
a
strip
of
her
land
so
he
could
have
a
bigger
yard
At
the
time
it
had
been
widely
reported
that
Tony
Rezko
was
under
federal
investigation
Questioned
later
about
the
timing
of
the
Rezko
deal
Obama
called
it
boneheaded
because
people
might
think
the
Rezkos
had
done
him
a
favor
The
Times
just
lets
it
lie
there
without
comment
It's
not
even
complicated
just
boneheaded
Obama
is
just
an
idiot
like
GW
Bush
so
naive
to
the
money
men
and
terrorists
in
his
circle
but
so
brilliant
and
nuanced
at
all
other
times
Gee
Wally
I
didn't
realize
that
Rezko
and
his
wife
saving
me
300,000
on
the
house
was
such
a
problem
Well
Beav
don't
do
it
again
or
I'll
have
to
slug
ya
you
bonehead

7
REASONS
WHY
McCAIN/PALIN
WILL
WIN
Paraphrased
from
the
redstate.com
post
1
The
media's
harping
and
yelping
for
Senator
Obama
created
massive
Obama
over-exposure
anger
and
resentment
that
will
be
expressed
in
the
voting
booth
on
November
4th
People
see
what
the
media
is
doing
2
The
Gallup
poll
after
Labor
Day
has
historically
predicted
the
winner
The
Gallup
poll
a
week
after
the
GOP
convention
had
McCain
up
3
Support
is
drying
up
among
Jews
the
more
they
learn
about
his
past
policy
statements
regarding
Israel
4
Young
people
are
easily
distracted
from
voting
on
Election
Day
Older
female
Clinton
voters
will
go
vote
and
not
for
Obama
5
In
an
unstable
world
people
vote
for
the
stronger
leader
It
isn't
Obama
6
McCain
is
likely
to
win
the
six
states
that
since
1972
have
voted
for
the
winning
candidate
AK
KY
LA
MO
OH
and
TN
7
Asians
Whites
and
Hispanics
have
been
lying
to
pollsters
in
significant
numbers
and
will
not
vote
for
Obama
The
Bradley
Effect
is
real
Just
trying
to
lift
my
own
spirits
more
than
anything

MEDIA
BIAS
Slate
polled
its
staff
regarding
who
they
will
vote
for
So
much
for
secret
ballot
but
liberals
don't
care
much
for
such
old-fashioned
traditions
The
results
Obama
56
Non-citizen
but
would
vote
for
Obama
3
McCain
1
Barr
1
Non-citizen
and
not
compelled
to
declare
a
preference
1
That
sounds
about
right
And
I'm
okay
with
that
If
you
disclose
openly
that
you
are
in
the
tank
for
Obama
then
it's
not
unfair
media
bias
The
scandal
is
that
CBS
and
NBC
and
the
New
York
Times
results
would
look
about
the
same

QUICK
HITS
ON
THE
WORLD
SERIES
Replay
Is
there
any
argument
left
for
not
having
replay
available
in
the
WS
to
fix
obviously
blown
calls
All
you
need
is
a
replay
official
in
the
booth
to
indicate
that
the
play
will
be
reviewed
and
you'll
have
the
right
call
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
argue
it
Jimmy
Rollins
for
example
was
clearly
tagged
out
in
the
first
inning
of
last
night's
Game
5
Jamie
Moyer
clearly
made
a
super
play
for
the
out
at
first
in
Game
3
I
feel
bad
for
Moyer
22
years
and
he
finally
gets
to
pitch
a
WS
game
and
instead
of
getting
the
win
and
an
all-time
highlight
reel
play
he
gets
neither
The
ump
put
himself
in
the
worst
possible
position
to
make
the
call
with
Ryan
Howard's
245
pounds
blocking
his
view
of
the
base
and
the
ball
Lord
Selig
Bud
Selig
appears
to
have
adopted
McCain's
communications
strategy
of
never
fully
explaining
himself
and
not
letting
his
inflection
give
any
hints
as
to
his
thinking
or
his
motivations
His
explanation
after
the
fact
that
he
was
not
going
to
let
the
WS
end
with
a
rain-shortened
game
and
that
common
sense
will
always
prevail
left
open
the
question
of
what
he
would
have
decided
had
the
Rays
taken
the
lead
in
top
6
Declare
them
the
winner
according
to
the
rules
stick
to
the
schedule
and
head
back
to
St
Pete
I
read
and
watched
the
news
this
morning
and
listened
to
XM's
Baseball
This
Morning
show
for
an
hour
with
no
answer
on
that
before
calling
the
show
and
talking
to
the
screener
and
also
emailing
host
Mark
Patrick
who
replied
thusly
They
said
they
were
going
to
play
the
full
game
no
matter
what...tied
or
otherwise
in
the
6th
If
they
said
that
during
the
telecast
I
missed
it
I
was
listening
to
both
the
Fox
TV
and
local
radio
broadcasts
and
missed
parts
of
each
And
the
quote
from
Selig
says
that
he
is
going
to
make
good
common-sense
decisions
in
real
time
Weather
report
It
rained
all
night
It
has
been
raining
all
day
I
drove
to
work
today
in
a
steady
rain
38
degrees
I
see
now
that
the
suspended
game
has
been
postponed
from
tonight
to
tomorrow
That's
the
right
call
It
is
miserable
today
You
are
at
the
mercy
of
Mother
Nature
when
you
stretch
the
postseason
into
the
last
week
of
October
The
unfortunate
thing
is
that
this
weather
is
bad
P.R
for
Philly
where
the
weather
was
beautiful
last
week
and
is
supposed
to
be
good
again
next
week
Oh
well
Watching
that
game
last
night
I
would
rather
have
been
anywhere
else
I
went
to
a
game
in
April
where
it
was
48
and
windy
and
that
was
bad
enough
38
and
rainy
and
windy
is
just
horrendous
weather
for
a
ballgame
Why
the
6th
Why
start
the
6th
inning
last
night
The
weather
was
not
going
to
improve
and
the
game
was
already
past
the
necessary
4-1/2
and
water
was
pooling
on
the
infield
and
the
wind
was
so
bad
that
the
infield
fly
rule
was
not
in
effect
and
Hamels
went
30
minutes
between
pitches
while
the
crew
worked
on
the
mound
Why
not
call
it
after
5
Under
the
conditions
there
was
no
way
to
throw
out
B.J
Upton
in
top
6
after
his
single
which
led
to
a
very
important
run
There
should
not
have
been
baseball
in
those
conditions
Late
play
I
was
12
when
the
Pirates
won
the
1979
WS
At
that
age
I
used
to
lie
on
my
bed
and
listen
to
the
games
at
night
on
a
scratchy
station
out
of
Linesville
PA
Then-broadcaster
Lanny
Frattare
just
retired
after
thirtysome
seasons
I
can
tell
you
most
or
all
of
their
starting
lineup
that
year
Now
I
have
a
9
yr
old
who
has
followed
the
Phils
all
year
and
is
wearing
his
Phillies
jersey
at
every
opportunity
this
month
We
are
making
some
exceptions
to
bedtime
so
that
he
can
watch
some
innings
but
we
can't
let
him
stay
up
till
midnight
to
watch
the
end
of
these
games
I
understand
maximizing
your
revenue
but
aren't
we
concerned
about
the
future
of
the
game
and
engaging
today's
young
fans
Heck
these
games
are
ending
well
past
my
own
bedtime
Likewise
the
other
parents
of
9
year
olds
in
the
neighborhood
are
not
appreciative
of
late
night
ball
Phils
win
This
is
how
the
Phillies
have
been
winning
all
year
Part
of
their
lineup
goes
cold
and
another
part
does
enough
to
win
ballgames
All
Fox
can
talk
about
is
how
the
Phils
aren't
hitting
with
RISP
even
as
the
Phils
ride
a
3-1
edge
in
the
Series
That's
how
it
was
all
year
No
respect
Like
I
tell
my
liberal
friends
about
presidential
elections
all
we
do
is
win
I
hope
to
be
able
to
say
that
again
next
week
on
behalf
of
both
the
Phils
and
the
GOP

POLITICAL
THOUGHTS
FROM
THE
FUTURE
OF
OUR
COUNTRY
A
Note
on
Anarchy
by
Donovan
Honorary
Junto
Boy
Anarchy
The
word
is
defined
as
the
complete
absence
of
government
and
authority
allowing
YOU
the
commoner
to
do
literally
anything
you
wish
to
do
When
people
think
of
Anarchy
thoughts
of
war
terror
and
chaos
are
the
first
things
to
come
to
mind
I
strongly
disagree
For
a
long
while
I
had
the
thought
and
support
of
the
anarchist
state
in
the
back
of
my
mind
seeing
it
in
a
very
different
way
though
I
never
openly
professed
it
mostly
for
fear
of
retribution
After
all
the
modern
day
anarchist
is
a
feared
and
avoided
individual
If
you
were
to
line
up
my
vision
of
anarchy
in
comparison
to
modern
day
society
it
would
actually
not
be
much
different
The
only
differences
really
is
that
we
would
no
longer
have
to
pay
taxes
we
would
fend
for
ourselves
and
whatever
we
needed
we
fetched
with
our
own
two
hands
or
with
the
help
of
our
own
city-state
Let
me
give
you
a
picture
of
what
I
see
as
anarchy
in
the
United
States
Anarchy
would
be
declared
officially
or
unofficially
the
government
would
be
dissolved
and
the
political
borders
of
the
states
would
no
longer
exist
Rather
they
would
exist
only
in
the
mind
sets
of
the
average
American
as
a
region
For
the
first
several
weeks
to
the
first
month
looting
bands
of
gangsters
and
would-be
criminals
would
roam
the
streets
attempting
to
prey
upon
the
weak
and
do
as
they
please
This
is
the
vision
of
anarchy
yes
but
morally
it
is
not
right
Because
of
this
order
would
return
without
the
government
returning
People
would
turn
their
eyes
to
their
family
friends
churches
community
or
what
have
you
for
guidance
instead
of
the
federal
government
Families
neighborhoods
and
towns
would
band
together
to
form
modern
day
city-states
When
one
of
these
roving
gangs
would
try
to
attack
a
city
state
or
loot
a
building
they
would
be
met
with
angry
townspeople
armed
with
guns
Because
the
majority
of
Americans
today
own
at
least
one
weapon
these
gangs
would
quickly
be
put
down
As
the
violence
subsides
natural
selection
would
take
place
Now
I
realize
I
will
get
a
lot
of
flak
for
this
but
you
must
face
the
inevitable
truth
of
an
anarchist
society
Natural
selection
is
the
process
of
nature
choosing
the
strongest
individuals
to
survive
Because
of
this
a
New
York
business
man
would
not
survive
long
indeed
in
an
anarchist
society
unless
he
can
quickly
learn
the
necessary
skills
to
survive
These
skills
are
hunting
building
crafting
etc
Those
with
weapons
and
those
skilled
in
these
crafts
will
become
the
leaders
of
these
city-states
not
corrupt
politicians
The
average
man
wold
look
not
to
his
company
position
but
instead
to
his
own
survival
He
or
she
would
begin
to
band
with
other
people
and
join
a
city-state
to
survive
The
skills
he
already
has
could
be
put
to
good
use
within
the
new
civilization
For
example
take
my
own
father
a
very
accomplished
and
experienced
psychologist
as
well
as
having
survival
hunting
and
woodsman
skills
His
natural
survival
skills
will
allow
him
to
survive
and
take
care
of
his
family
but
his
skills
in
psychology
make
him
a
great
asset
In
times
of
anarchy
he
can
be
responsible
for
keeping
morale
high
thus
making
him
a
valuable
member
of
society
Technology
would
still
survive
so
long
as
it
is
maintained
by
the
city-states
Telephone
service
could
be
maintained
within
a
short
distance
if
the
city
state
learns
how
to
operate
the
necessary
equipment
to
keep
phone
lines
running
etc
The
same
goes
for
computers
and
modern
appliances
Electricity
could
easily
be
compensated
for
by
attaining
a
generator
Perhaps
even
modern
conveniences
such
as
radio
and
television
could
still
exist
in
the
later
years
of
anarchy
provided
local
programming
The
United
States
would
still
exist
in
the
minds
of
every
American
in
the
new
Anarchist
society
as
an
abstract
ideal
that
inspires
Americans
For
this
reason
people
would
still
fly
the
American
flag
call
themselves
Americans
and
even
band
together
to
defend
the
country
if
need
be
If
the
anarchist
USA
were
to
be
attacked
by
a
foreign
nation
seeking
to
take
over
the
supposedly
weak
US
the
people
would
band
together
and
reactivate
the
old
government
war
machines
Those
skilled
in
using
them
would
form
the
military
to
combat
this
danger
and
though
warfare
would
be
waged
differently
it
would
be
waged
in
defense
of
our
absolute
perfect
freedom
The
economy
of
an
anarchy
would
be
very
different
Instead
of
a
common
currency
bartering
would
be
the
main
form
of
trade
There
would
be
no
organized
market
or
prices
Supply
and
demand
would
still
exist
yes
but
anyone
is
free
to
set
their
own
prices
Joe
could
say
he
wants
300
logs
for
his
herd
of
oxen
and
Bob
could
decide
to
take
it
or
not
This
results
in
a
traditional
type
of
economy
one
where
people
take
care
of
each
other
and
do
what
is
necessary
for
their
own
survival
and
that
of
those
around
them
The
justification
of
anarchy
is
the
ultimate
American
ideal
of
freedom
Freedom
is
this
idea
of
being
able
to
do
as
your
own
good
morality
dictates
it
whether
your
morality
be
that
of
a
crazed
war
monger
a
gospel
preaching
witness
or
what
have
you
The
reason
anarchy
cannot
exist
at
the
present
here-and-now
is
because
too
many
people
depend
on
the
government
they
literally
do
not
make
decisions
for
them
selves
and
instead
look
to
the
government
for
life
support
Too
many
people
would
not
know
what
to
do
with
their
new
found
absolute
freedom
and
would
instead
head
north
or
south
to
socialist
Canada
and
Mexico
The
ideology
of
a
true
anarchist
is
not
that
of
a
futuristic
war
torn
land
scape...Why
even
the
Anarchist
Cookbook
is
laughed
upon
by
true
freedom
loving
anarchists
The
true
goal
of
a
true
anarchist
is
having
a
society
where
there
is
no
Man
to
bring
you
down
no
government
to
pay
tribute
to
and
the
ability
to
live
by
YOUR
rules
the
way
YOU
want
While
anarchy
is
usually
thought
to
be
a
radical
left-wing
ideal
I
propose
it
is
exactly
the
opposite
The
right
wing
lead
by
the
Republican
Party
is
all
about
less
government
capitalism
and
lower
taxes
Why
not
take
it
all
the
way
There
are
many
schools
of
thought
on
anarchy
and
while
it
is
true
that
many
anarchists
are
radical
communists
or
left
wingers
true
anarchy
is
absolute
freedom
Individual
anarchy
is
what
I
personally
believe
in
Individual
anarchy
promulgates
the
idea
of
private
ownership
in
essence
this
is
capitalism
to
the
max
unlike
the
socialist
anarchy
screamed
by
Karl
Marx
and
Peter
Kropotkin
Socialist
anarchy
is
basically
anarchy
where
everything
is
publicly
owned
this
is
not
true
anarchy
in
that
you
are
required
to
share
with
others
If
you
so
desire
to
not
share
and
you
cannot
that
defeats
the
ideology
of
the
anarchist
state
The
extreme
and
radical
forms
of
anarchy
include
Anarcho-Feminism
which
asserts
that
women
should
have
absolute
freedom
over
men
Green
Anarchy
which
states
that
all
technology
should
be
abolished
in
the
name
of
Mother
Earth
and
Chaotic-Anarchy
which
is
basically
the
idea
of
an
absolute
war
torn
hell
Note
that
these
all
restrict
liberty
in
some
form
or
another
which
defeats
the
true
anarchist
cause
Modern
day
Anarchist
promulgations
include
the
Libertarian
Party
While
not
truly
anarchist
their
basic
ideas
constitute
getting
as
close
to
anarchy
as
possible
without
actually
having
the
absence
of
government
All
in
all
however
anarchy
truly
is
the
way
of
absolute
individual
freedom
It
allows
you
to
think
feel
and
do
however
you
choose
whether
that
be
a
socialist
or
conservative
mindset
Truly
should
we
all
not
wish
for
anarchy

THE
QUESTIONS
BROKAW
WON'T
ASK
Watch
the
video
here
I
don't
watch
local
news(maybe
I
should
but
Barbara
West
of
Orlando's
ABC
affiliate
asks
Biden
the
kind
of
questions
we've
been
waiting
for
from
the
national
media
The
Obama
spokesperson
issued
this
statement
about
the
interview
There's
nothing
wrong
with
tough
questions
but
reporters
have
the
very
important
job
of
sharing
the
truth
with
the
public
not
misleading
the
American
people
with
false
information
What
part
of
the
interview
was
misleading
and
false
information
If
spreading
the
wealth
around
is
not
Marxist
who
was
the
first
to
suggest
it
This
is
what
Biden
said
to
the
Marx
query
He's
not
spreading
the
wealth
around
but
giving
the
middle
class
a
chance
to
get
back
the
tax
breaks
they
use
to
have
What
Obama
is
on
record
saying
Spread
the
wealth
around
Biden
is
pretending
it
never
happened
thus
acknowledging
the
political
damage
What
tax
breaks
did
the
middle
class
ever
have
that
weren't
the
gift
of
Republicans
People
making
1.4
million
dollars
good
decent
people
are
going
to
get
a
new
87
billion
tax
cut
a
new
one
on
top
of
last
year
How
could
they
get
a
new
one
with
a
Democrat
Congress
We
think
the
people
millionaires
aren't
people
should
be
getting
that
tax
break
Not
continue
to
distribute
that
wealth
up
We
think
middle
class
tax
payers
should
get
a
tax
break
That's
what
we
think
It's
a
ridiculous
comparison
in
all
due
respect
Biden
laughed
off
the
Marxist
quote
and
then
went
on
to
become
a
character
in
Orwell's
1984
explaining
that
redistribution
is
the
act
of
letting
people
keep
their
own
money
Also
his
quote
implies
the
logical
fallacy
that
anything
the
wealthy
keep
prevents
the
middle
class
from
keeping
theirs
Why
can't
everyone
keep
what
they
make
Biden
Here's
the
Obama
Capaign
weighing
in
Senator
Biden
handled
the
interview
well
however
the
anchor
was
completely
unprofessional
Senator
Biden's
wife
is
not
running
for
elected
office
and
there
are
many
other
stations
in
the
Orlando
television
market
that
would
gladly
conduct
a
respectful
and
factual
interview
with
her
This
cancellation
is
non-negotiable
and
further
opportunities
for
your
station
to
interview
with
this
campaign
are
unlikely
at
best
for
the
duration
of
the
remaining
days
until
the
election
This
refers
to
their
losing
an
upcoming
interview
with
Mrs
Biden
as
punishment
implying
that
their
interview
would
be
disrespectful
with
her
Did
they
disrespect
Biden
The
reaction
demonstrates
their
expectations
of
the
Main
Stream
Media
and
how
one
little
interview
makes
it
all
unravel

PREDICTIONS
for
the
unintended
consequences
of
a
Barack
Obama
Presidency
1
IRAN
STRENGTHENED
With
the
certainty
of
U.S
intervention
being
limited
to
Diplomacy
in
an
Obama
Presidency
Iran
will
become
emboldened
This
is
likely
why
their
President
has
suddenly
taken
ill
I
imagine
the
CIA
were
given
the
go
to
take
this
fellow
out
as
a
warning
to
the
clerics
not
to
play
puppet
master
with
it's
neighbors
Perhaps
Bush
has
installed
enough
Pro-American
elements
within
the
intelligence
and
defense
departments
to
curb
radically
left
policies
2
BLACK
COMEDIANS
SUDDENLY
LESS
FUNNY
This
happened
to
poor
Yackoff
Smirnoff
after
the
fall
of
the
USSR
What
made
Black
Comedy
ala
Chris
Rock
or
Dave
Chappell
funny
was
that
even
if
you
weren't
Black
you
could
identify
with
the
attack
on
the
man
You
felt
for
the
plight
of
the
oppressed
class
and
most
all
of
those
jokes
arise
out
of
the
field
of
oppression
We
all
want
to
attack
the
man
Now
that
the
man
is
an
intelligent
well-spoken
articulate
Black
man
well
it's
not
so
funny
any
more
3
RACISM
IS
CHANGED
FOREVER
The
first
Black
President
will
give
perceptual
evidence
to
whites
that
the
era
of
racism
is
over
Forever
there
after
once
conservative
politicians
are
back
in
power
and
they
begin
dismantling
the
Affirmative
Action
and
scholarship
programs
based
on
race
they
will
simply
point
to
Obama
as
proof
that
instutionalized
and
cultural
Racism
is
over
The
left
will
no
longer
have
the
moral
high-ground
on
this
issue
Further
any
efforts
Obama
makes
to
allot
special
privileges
or
create
a
new
civil
rights
legislation
will
backfire
as
being
disingenious
or
out
of
touch
4
CRAZED
ULTRA
LEFT
NUT
CASES
WILL
THINK
THEY
ARE
MAINSTREAM
Just
like
what
happened
in
the
Clinton
Administration
with
the
likes
of
Joscelin
Elders
as
Surgeon
General
the
ultra
left
will
think
America
has
gone
left
and
will
start
advocating
crack-pot
schemes
that
will
make
Clinton's
policies
seem
quaint
by
comparison
Remember
when
Joscelin
suggested
the
school
system
teach
pre-teens
and
teens
masturbation
as
a
way
to
curb
teen
pregnancy
I
think
she
had
to
resign
after
that
5
PUTTING
FORTH
FAIRNESS
DOCTRINE
WILL
ONLY
BACKFIRE
The
fairness
doctrine
will
be
successfully
challenged
and
overturned
by
the
Supreme
Court
in
a
case
titled
Clear
Channel/Fox
News
vs
U.S.A
This
will
have
the
effect
of
placing
President
Obama
in
the
corner
of
suppressing
Free
speech
which
will
drive
down
his
poll
numbers
to
an
abysmal
level
6
RACISM
WILL
LIKELY
BE
USED
BY
THE
WHITEHOUSE
AS
REASON
FOR
ANY
DECENT
This
will
only
fail
and
will
paint
Obama
as
fear
mongering
and
lying
about
his
desire
to
be
the
Post-Racial
President
See
point

RADICAL
CONGRESS
MEMBERS
IN
SPOTLIGHT
DAILY
There
is
only
so
many
ways
to
protray
the
likes
of
Barney
Frank
The
more
he's
on
TV
the
more
I
like
it
because
at
least
he
speaks
from
the
truly
ultra-left
wing
and
not
in
glossed
over
platitudes
like
Obama
People
will
hear
this
sort
of
talk
over
and
over
and
get
disgusted
with
it
8
BACKLASH
The
coming
Backlash
of
2010
and
2012
will
make
the
Reagan
revolution
look
like
a
blip
on
the
screen
by
comparison
I
plan
on
running
in
the
2010
cycle
to
ride
the
wave
in
Then
running
for
President
in
2012

WHY
DO
I
CARE
I
am
highly
exercised
that
Obama
and
liberal
Congressional
leaders
are
going
to
control
the
agenda
and
the
purse
strings
of
this
great
nation
I
never
warmed
that
much
to
McCain
but
I
feel
strongly
about
casting
my
vote
against
Obama
I
know
that
all
I
can
do
is
cast
my
one
vote
and
take
a
son
into
the
booth
to
pull
the
lever
and
do
my
best
to
enjoy
unilateral
disarmament
but
still
it
irks
me
that
a
fraud
like
Obama
might
well
take
the
throne
It
irks
me
Talk

THE
ONE
ON
WHOM
NO
INVESTIGATION
MUST
BE
DONE
What
is
more
discouraging
to
me
than
the
likely
outcome
of
this
election
is
the
way
in
which
most
of
the
media
has
scrupulously
avoided
giving
play
to
any
of
the
many
real
and
imagined
curiosities
about
Obama's
past
And
not
wanting
to
give
credence
to
potentially
false
or
worse
silly
insinuations
I
have
not
posted
on
the
legal
challenges
of
Philip
Berg
in
Pennsylvania
and
Andy
Martin
of
New
York
in
Hawai'i
to
achieve
the
release
of
Obama's
birth
certificate
certificate
of
live
birth
or
COLB
The
issue
of
why
Obama
won't
release
his
birth
certificate
was
raised
months
ago
and
faded
when
his
fightthesmears
website
posted
an
image
of
it
Document
experts
say
the
image
was
clearly
a
forgery
Berg
says
Obama
was
born
in
Kenya
and
is
a
citizen
of
Indonesia
Martin
goes
further
to
claim
that
Barack
Obama
is
not
Barack
Obama
II's
father
Martin
is
a
radio
personality
who
is
hawking
his
book
about
Obama
but
even
if
that
calls
his
motives
into
question
I'd
still
like
to
know
the
facts
behind
Obama's
mysterious
lineage
If
Obama
was
not
born
in
the
USA
he
is
not
a
naturalized
citizen
and
is
not
eligible
to
be
POTUS
You'll
recall
the
strange
New
York
Times
story
suggesting
knowingly
wrongly
that
McCain
might
not
be
eligible
and
the
media
line
about
Sarah
Palin
not
having
been
vetted
and
the
highly
publicized
suggestions
that
Trig
is
not
Sarah's
son
Those
plainly
fabricated
stories
make
more
sense
if
the
real
deal
is
that
Obama
is
not
eligible
Obama
has
not
been
vetted
and
Obama's
paternity
is
a
sham
Seriously
should
it
be
so
hard
or
really
any
issue
at
all
for
a
presidential
candidate
to
produce
valid
documentation
of
US
citizenship
Are
we
allowed
to
ask
anything
of
this
guy
at
all
You
can
read
about
Berg
at
newsmax.com
and
elsewhere
Martin
gives
a
thorough
accounting
at
his
blog
The
courts
have
not
been
accommodating
dismissing
Berg's
case
in
a
ruling
handed
down
at
Friday
6:15pm
he
is
appealing
and
giving
Martin
a
hearing
on
November
7th
should
he
be
willing
to
fly
back
to
Hawai'i
once
the
news
value
of
his
challenge
has
passed
A
federal
judge
has
tossed
out
a
complaint
that
Barack
Obama's
name
should
be
taken
off
the
ballot
because
he
is
ineligible
to
be
president
because
he
is
a
citizen
of
Indonesia
rather
than
the
United
States
Former
Pennsylvania
Deputy
Attorney
General
Philip
J
Berg
claimed
in
a
complaint
filed
in
federal
district
court
that
Obama
was
born
in
Mombasa
Kenya
rather
than
Hawaii
according
to
the
Philadelphia
Daily
News
The
complaing
demanded
that
Obama's
lawyers
produce
a
copy
of
his
original
birth
certificate
to
prove
that
he
is
a
natural-born
U.S
citizen
The
Constitution
provides
that
any
U.S
citizen
is
eligible
to
become
president
if
the
person
is
35
years
of
age
or
older
and
is
a
natural-born
citizen
that
is
born
in
the
territorial
United
States
On
Friday
night
U.S
District
Judge
R
Barclay
Surrick
sided
with
the
Democratic
National
Committee
which
had
asked
Surrick
to
dismiss
Berg's
complaint
Surrick
issued
a
34-page
memorandum
and
opinion
that
said
the
claims
were
ridiculous
and
patently
false
He
also
said
Berg's
effort
to
pursue
his
claim
regarding
Obama's
citizenship
were
frivolous
and
not
worthy
of
discussion
Allegations
surrounding
Obama's
place
of
birth
have
been
swirling
for
months
Earlier
this
year
the
Obama
campaign
sought
to
put
down
the
rumors
by
making
available
a
computer-generated
Certification
of
Live
Birth
issued
in
2007
by
the
State
of
Hawaii
See
the
Certification
of
Live
Birth
Click
Here
However
the
2007
document
produced
by
the
Obama
campaign
omits
key
information
that
normally
appears
on
birth
certificates
in
the
United
States
including
the
name
of
the
hospital
where
he
was
born
the
size
and
weight
of
the
baby
and
sometimes
the
name
of
the
doctor
who
delivered
him
In
addition
the
critics
of
the
2007
document
note
that
Obama's
father
is
described
as
African
a
term
used
today
The
formal
language
in
official
documents
at
the
time
1961
would
have
identified
his
race
as
Negro
or

The
Web
site
snarkybytes.com
has
produced
a
vault
copy
of
a
Hawaii
Certificate
of
Live
Birth
from
1963
issued
by
the
Hawaii
Department
of
Health

In
addition
to
naming
the
hospital
and
more
details
about
the
baby
the
1963
vault
copy
also
includes
the
usual
residence
of
the
mother
and
the
usual
occupation
of
the
father
None
of
this
information
appears
on
the
2007
Live
Birth
certificate
produced
by
the
Obama
campaign
I
don't
get
how
a
District
Judge
can
throw
out
the
challenge
as
frivolous
ridiculous
patently
false
and
not
worthy
of
discussion
without
reference
to
a
valid
COLB
as
required
by
the
Constitution
Martin
argues
that
by
posting
a
version
of
his
birth
certificate
on
the
Web
Obama
has
waived
any
privacy
claims
It
is
odd
to
say
the
least
that
Obama
claims
to
have
posted
the
COLB
and
settled
the
matter
yet
claims
that
no
one
should
be
able
to
obtain
an
official
copy
of
the
same
document
from
the
State
of
Hawai'i
or
review
the
source
information
for
the
certificate
Obama
claims
he
was
born
in
a
Honolulu
hospital
but
there
is
no
verifiable
evidence
to
sustain
the
claim
Berg
claims
to
have
video
evidence
of
Obama's
paternal
grandmother
and
another
Kenyan
relative
saying
that
they
were
present
at
his
birth
in
Kenya
Why
do
I
find
this
suspicious
and
why
does
it
grate
me
so
Because
in
2004
around
May
I
think
I
was
flipping
channels
and
came
across
the
Swift
Boat
Veterans
for
Truth
doing
a
press
conference
at
the
National
Press
Club
in
D.C
It
was
extremely
compelling
testimony
by
decorated
veterans
and
obviously
very
damaging
to
John
Kerry
if
true
It
was
quite
a
lineup
of
Kerry's
contemporaries
people
who
served
with
him
directly
making
very
serious
charges
against
him
charges
that
went
to
his
character
and
integrity
and
honesty
and
motives
charges
that
if
not
true
would
stain
their
own
characters
forever
The
next
morning
I
hit
the
news
websites
and
cable
news
channels
for
coverage
of
these
explosive
accusations
and
crickets
Nothing
All
day
nothing
next
day
nothing
The
AP
which
had
had
a
reporter
in
the
room
said
in
a
statement
that
the
press
conference
had
had
no
news
value
Eventually
weeks
or
months
later
the
Swift
Boat
Vets
got
some
private
funding
and
got
their
message
out
and
Fox
News
picked
it
up
and
hammered
it
until
other
media
outlets
finally
had
to
bite
But
in
this
election
the
potentially
explosive
accusations
against
Obama
have
gained
no
traction
at
all
The
Democrats
I
know
either
don't
know
about
them
or
they
laugh
them
off
I
don't
claim
to
have
a
lock
on
the
truth
but
I
do
expect
a
fair
debate
and
I
have
been
consistently
disappointed
