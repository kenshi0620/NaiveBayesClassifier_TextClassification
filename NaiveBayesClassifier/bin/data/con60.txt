Why
do
I
have
a
feeling
that
God
may
soon
start
getting
better
press
coverage
His
passing
is
a
real
loss
Hopefully
his
family
will
find
comfort
in
knowing
how
many
people
liked
and
admired
him

Merry
X-Mass
and
so
forth
Here's
hoping
that
all
of
my
former
readers
will
follow
my
example
and
really
remember
what
this
season
is
all
about
1
Buying
and/or
receiving
expensive
presents
2
Eating
truly
life-threatning
amounts
of
sugar
and/or
fat
and
3
Blowing
off
work
for
a
week
and
traveling
someplace
warm
Remember
Baby
Jesus
wants
you
to
party

If
I
learned
one
thing
this
weekend
it's
that
if
you're
ever
in
Texas
you
need
to
make
friends
with
the
DuToits
I
don't
think
I've
ever
had
better
hosts
or
felt
so
comfortable
with
people
so
quickly
After
a
great
day
of
shooting
yesterday
they
had
us
to
their
house
this
morning
for
brunch
a
FEAST
and
conversation
We
also
stopped
on
the
way
out
of
town
at
the
coolest
outdoors/sporting/&gun
store
I've
ever
seen
In
addition
to
the
cool
normal
guns
for
sale
downstairs
the
DuToits
showed
us
the
fine
gun
room
upstairs
where
a
typical
shotgun
might
sell
for
over
ten
thousand
dollars
Anyway
it's
hard
to
believe
that
our
stay
in
Texas
was
only
36
hours
It
felt
like
a
week
which
sounds
like
a
bad
thing
but
is
really
a
good
thing
Oh
I
didn't
take
pictures
Sorry
Shame
on
me
Someone
else
did
though

Turning
In
We
didn't
stay
real
late
at
the
wedding
just
long
enough
to
see
the
ceremony
have
dinner
and
meet
the
bride
groom
We
were
up
at
5am
today
and
are
beat
There
was
a
Karaoke
fest
planned
in
lieu
of
the
typical
dance
music
but
who
would
ever
want
to
follow
the
angel-voiced
SarahK
Should
it
be
SarahJ
now
SarahF
doesn't
seem
right
Anyway
the
bride
was
gorgeous
and
charming
The
groom
was
also
present
apparently
The
only
disappointment
was
that
many
bloggers
that
I
thought
might
be
there
couldn't
attend
CadetHappy
was
there
but
I
didn't
get
a
chance
to
say
hi
because
he
was
chasing
his
9
kids
around
that's
not
an
exact
number
I'm
using
the
same
sampling
techniques
the
Census
bureau
uses
to
count
underrepresented
groups
Laurence
Simon
may
come
in
for
some
cruel
mockery
in
light
of
his
absence

Texas
Greetings
from
Texas
We're
chilling
out
in
our
hotel
room
resting
after
our
day
at
the
range
with
Kim
Connie
Kim
provided
SEVEN
fine
handguns
for
us
to
play
with
For
the
longest
time
I
couldn't
decide
whether
I
preferred
the
Browning
HiPower
or
the
Colt
Python
In
the
end
it
was
probably
the
Colt
that
tickled
my
fancy
the
most
but
it
was
a
close
un
I
guess
I'll
have
to
buy
one
of
each
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
We
also
shot
Kim's
carry
1911
his
Browning
Buckmark
22
a
Ruger
Single
Six
22
a
Ruger
Blackhawk
in
30
carbine
and
one
of
those
little
NAA
mini-mag
revolvers
I
think
that's
it
but
there
was
so
much
lead
in
the
air
I
may
be
forgetting
something
I'm
pleased
to
report
that
I
shot
rather
well
for
me
for
having
not
picked
up
a
gun
in
about
3
months
Of
course
Laura
who
hasn't
shot
in
over
a
year
was
at
least
as
good
Connie
is
as
charming
as
you'd
expect
and
Kim
well
I
didn't
see
him
shoot
even
one
person
while
I
was
with
him
Of
course
I
wasn't
watching
him
every
second
He
did
rush
us
out
of
that
cafe
pretty
quick
when
I
got
back
from
the
restroom
Anyway
we'll
rest
a
bit
then
head
out
to
the
Frank
Sarah
nuptials

Travelling
By
the
way
the
Missus
and
I
will
be
going
to
Texas
this
weekend
for
the
wedding
of
Frank
J
and
Sarah
K
Yee
haw
It's
quite
a
trip
for
just
a
weekend
but
we
have
kind
of
a
soft
spot
for
blog
couples
as
you
might
imagine
Expect
some
photos

DISCLAIMER

several

This
website
is
a
place
for
me
to
jot
down
my
personal
opinions
half-baked
theories
and
other
streams
of
consciousness
It
is
a
place
for
me
to
talk
about
my
favorite
hobbies
and
interests
It
is
at
times
a
spot
for
humor
and
parody
You
may
or
may
not
find
all
of
these
items
funny
Do
not
be
alarmed
Some
of
these
jokes
are
just
for
me

forum
for
any
interested
party

participate
in

of
any
topic
we
address
here
It's
a
high-tech
diary
and
a
way
for
my
family
and
friends
to
keep
tabs
on
what's
going
on
in
my
life
when
I
forget
to
call
It
is
written

maintained
by
me
exclusively
on
my
own
time
Forget
what
the
time
stamps
may
say
I
mostly
just
make
those
up
I'll
often
write
several
posts
in
the
late
evening
after
work
or
in
the
early
morning
before
it
and
program
them
to
appear
on
the
site
at
various
times
during
the
day
to
keep
this
place
from

stale
