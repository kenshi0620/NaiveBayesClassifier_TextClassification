Working
for
Obama
in
the
NC
Mountains
I
haven't
been
blogging
lately
because
I
was
offered
a
Get
Out
The
Vote
position
with
the
Obama
campaign
in
the
mountains
of
North
Carolina
Most
of
my
father's
family
is
from
McDowell
County
so
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
the
mountains
during
my
childhood
I
can't
put
into
words
how
exciting
it
is
to
be
working
for
the
Obama
campaign
in
my
home
state
especially
in
a
part
of
the
state
where
much
of
my
family
tree
is
rooted
Once
I
got
the
assignment
I
made
some
Scotch-Irish
For
Obama
buttons
with
the
help
of
a
couple
of
friends
of
mine
and
it
has
been
fun
wearing
mine
around
town
call
me
biased
but
the
plaid
in
the
background
is
the
Anderson
tartan
I
can't
talk
about
anything
campaign-related
but
I
can
say
that
the
support
for
Obama
in
the
mountains
definitely
includes
a
broader
range
of
people
than
I
had
expected
it's
not
just
Asheville
which
is
one
of
the
most
liberal
cities
in
the
Southeast
The
man
pictured
above
who
lives
in
Swain
County
is
probably
one
of
the
most
compelling
examples
Anyway
I
will
resume
blogging
sometime
after
Election
Day
in
the
meantime
don't
forget
to
vote

Summary
of
Barack

Legislative
Record
ILLINOIS
STATE
SENATE
Barack
Obama
served
in
the
Illinois
Senate
for
eight
years
1997
to
2004
sponsoring
823
bills
according
to

Bills
sponsored
by

which
were
enacted
into

include
the
1998
Illinois
Gift
Ban
http://tinyurl.com/56ldrm
which
has
been
described
as
the
state's
most
sweeping
good-government
legislation
in
decades
the
2003
Hospital

Act
http://tinyurl.com/6gnv4e

requires
hospitals
to
disclose
infection
rates
nurse
staffing
levels
and
the

number
of
hours
worked
per
nurse
in
quarterly
reports
the
2004
Health

http://tinyurl.com/6ryyn4
which
established
a
bipartisan
commission
tasked
with
creating
a
universal
health

plan
for
IL
residents
a
2003
law
which
expanded
state
health
care
coverage
to
154,000
IL
residents
by
raising
the
eligibility
requirement
from
185
to
200

a
2003

made
Illinois
the

require
videotaped
interrogations

suspects
in
capital

a

One
thing
that
stands
out
about
Obama's
record
in
the
State
Senate
is
his
belief
that
providing
greater
transparency
is
a
key
to
government
reform
The
common
thread
between
the
Gift
Ban
the
Hospital
Report
Card
Act
the
videotaped
interrogations
law
and
the
racial
profiling
law
is
that
they
all
reflect
the
view
that
sunlight
is
the
greatest
disinfectant
In
the
case
of
his
videotaped
interrogations
law
Obama
eventually
was
able
to
convince
skeptical
law
enforcement
officials
and
Republican
legislators
that
transparency
would
improve
the
criminal
justice
system
for
everyone
because
in
his
words
the
videotaping
of
interrogations
and
confessions
is
both
a
tool
for
protecting
the
innocent
as
well
as
a
tool
for
convicting
the
guilty

Barack

has
probably
been
the

PROLIFERATION

One
of

the

established
by

focused
on
the
interdiction
of
unsecured
WMD's
in
the
recently-dissolved
Soviet
Union
especially
nuclear
weapons
the
Lugar-Obama
law
expands
the
scope
of
those
programs
to
include
conventional
non-WMD
weapons
like
shoulder-fired
anti-aircraft
missiles
and
also
bolsters
the
State
Department's
ability
to
interdict
materials
used
to
make
WMD's
According
to

hailing

the

had
its

in
the

Thoughts
on
Palin's
speech
The
most
striking
thing
about
Palin's
speech
was
that
she
used
such
a
negative
and
petty
tone
in
her
introduction
to
the
American
people
As
an
Obama
supporter
I
was
starting
to
worry
that
the
McCain
campaign
had
outsmarted
everyone
by
picking
a
likable
sympathetic
female
candidate
who
would
be
almost
impossible
to
challenge
or
attack
without
running
the
risk
of
alienating
voters
But
her
tone
tonight
may
have
insured
that
she's
fair
game
from
here
on
out
Some
of
her
attacks
were
ridiculously
hypocritical
The
most
embarrassing
example
had
to
be
when
she
made
fun
of
the
columns
that
stood
behind
Obama
during
his
acceptance
speech
from
a
stage
adorned
not
only
with
a
replica
of
the
Liberty
Bell
but
also
with
a
massive
Jumbotron
which
alternated
between
an
American
flag
and
images
of
other
famous
national
landmarks
There
was
also
her
attack
on
Obama's
years
as
a
community
organizer
which
Giuliani
had
already
made
fun
of
earlier
in
the
night
I
guess
a
small-town
mayor
is
sort
of
like
a
community
organizer
except
that
you
have
actual
responsibilities
This
line
was
a
huge
crowd
pleaser
but
it's
a
strange
comparison
for
her
to
make
Obama
worked
as
a
community
organizer
between
1985
and
1988
since
then
he
has
attended
law
school
worked
as
a
lawyer
in
Chicago
taught
at
the
University
of
Chicago
Law
School
served
as
an
Illinois
State
Senator
for
8
years
and
then
served
as
a
U.S
Senator
for
4
years
In
contrast
Palin
was
still
mayor
of
Wasilla
until
December
2006
when
she
was
sworn
in
as
Governor
of
Alaska
So
when
she
mocked
Barack
Obama's
experience
level
she
was
comparing
the
job
she
held
just
20
months
ago
to
the
job
he
held
20
years
ago
UPDATED
9/4/08
The
good
news
is
that
a
lot
of
people
seem
to
have
had
the
same
reaction
to
Palin's
dismissive
condescension
The
Detroit
Free
Press
asked
a
voter
panel
for
reactions
to
the
speech
and
almost
all
of
the
panelists
who
identified
themselves
as
independents
were
turned
off
Another
thing
I
wonder
about
is
whether
the
GOP
is
underestimating
how
distant
and
exotic
Alaska
seems
to
people
east
of
the
Mississippi
which
is
where
most
but
not
all
of
the
major
battleground
states
are
I
think
most
people
put
Alaska
in
the
same
category
as
Obama's
home
state
of
Hawaii
and
I
think
Obama
would
be
a
much
less
credible
candidate
if
he
was
the
junior
Senator
from
Hawaii
rather
than
Illinois
a
heavily-populated
state
that
is
home
to
Chicago
one
of
the
major
business
capitals
in
the
country
If
you're
a
swing
voter
in
Ohio
Pennsylvania
or
Michigan
Chicago
is
a
lot
closer
to
home

Are
we
going
to
make
another
big
election
about
small
things
I
still
don't
know
what
to
make
of
the
Palin
pick
but
increasingly
I
think
it
is
a
deliberate
attempt
by
McCain
to
distract
the
electorate
from
the
bigger
issues
where
the
Democrats
have
an
edge
this
time
around
Why
would
anyone
knowingly
pick
a
VP
with
a
four-month
old
baby
and
a
pregnant
unmarried
teenage
daughter
unless
he
thinks
that
the
inevitable
soap
opera
coverage
would
benefit
the
ticket
George
Lakoff
has
the
best
analysis
I've
seen
of
the
pick
so
far

Huffington
Post
UPDATED

On
the
other
hand
after
reading
this
New
York
Times
article
maybe
the
McCain
campaign
just
botched
the
whole
thing
completely
They
didn't
speak
to
anyone
in
the
Legislature
they
didn't
speak
to
anyone
in
the
business
community
said
Lyda
Green
the
State
Senate
president
who
lives
in
Wasilla
where
Ms
Palin
served
as
mayor
Representative
Gail
Phillips
a
Republican
and
former
speaker
of
the
State
House
said
the
widespread
surprise
in
Alaska
when
Ms
Palin
was
named
to
the
ticket
made
her
wonder
how
intensively
the
McCain
campaign
had
vetted
her
I
started
calling
around
and
asking
and
I
have
not
been
able
to
find
one
person
that
was
called
Ms
Phillips
said
I
called
30
to
40
people
political
leaders
business
leaders
community
leaders
Not
one
of
them
had
heard
Alaska
is
a
very
small
community
we
know
people
all
over
but
I
haven't
found
anybody
who
was
asked
anything
The
current
mayor
of
Wasilla
Dianne
M
Keller
said
she
had
not
heard
of
any
efforts
to
look
into
Ms
Palin's
background
And
Randy
Ruedrich
the
state
Republican
Party
chairman
said
he
knew
nothing
of
any
vetting
that
had
been
conducted
State
Senator
Hollis
French
a
Democrat
who
is
directing
the
ethics
investigation
said
that
no
one
asked
him
about
the
allegations
I
heard
not
a
word
not
a
single
contact
he
said
Andrew
Sullivan
is
right
the
story
here
isn't
about
Palin
it's
about
what
the
pick
says
about
John
McCain
especially
in
contrast
with
the
Obama
campaign's
cautious
research-intensive
vetting
process

Thoughts
on
Obama's
acceptance
speech
A
few
random
unorganized
observations
about
Obama's
acceptance
speech
Obviously
everyone
has
known
for
a
while
now
that
he
was
going
to
become
the
first
black
person
to
accept
a
Presidential
nomination
for
a
major
party
But
it
wasn't
until
I
got
to
work
yesterday
that
it
really
started
to
hit
me
Last
night
was
a
huge
transformative
moment
in
American
history
I
am
still
trying
to
wrap
my
head
around
the
magnitude
of
it
Am
I
crazy
for
wondering
if
this
is
as
big
a
deal
as
Jackie
Robinson
breaking
baseball's
color
barrier
Or
is
it
crazy
not
to
think
that
a
black
man
running
for
leader
of
the
free
world
is
an
even
bigger
deal
than
Jackie
Robinson's
feat
The
historical
significance
of
Obama
becoming
the
nominee
underscores
how
brilliant
it
was
for
his
campaign
to
focus
so
heavily
on
the
mantra
of
Change
The
mere
act
of
a
President
Obama
sitting
down
at
the
desk
in
the
Oval
Office
for
the
first
time
would
immediately
represent
one
of
the
most
significant
changes
in
the
history
of
American
politics
If
a
President
Obama
could
deliver
even
an
average
presidency
and
by
average
I
mean
substantially
more
effective
than
Bush
whose
ranking
might
match
his
43
order
number
he's
lived
up
to
the
hype
I
was
impressed
by
how
stern
and
serious
Obama
was
as
compared
to
his
standard
stump
speech
and
that
was
exactly
how
he
needed
to
be
His
goal
was
to
convince
Democrats
and
swing
voters
who
are
on
the
fence
that
he
is
ready
to
lead
and
he
did
a
good
job
of
projecting
that
The
speech
seemed
to
start
off
a
little
slow
but
it
seemed
intentionally
restrained
and
the
intensity
seemed
to
build
over
the
course
of
speech
until
it
rose
to
the
level
of
being
a
great
one
I
loved
when
Obama
ended
a
discussion
of
his
family's
middle-class
values
by
saying
I
don't
know
what
kind
of
lives
John
McCain
thinks
that
celebrities
lead
but
this
has
been
mine
It
made
that
ad
seem
so
incredibly
desperate
and
embarrassing
One
of
the
main
reasons
Obama
has
appealed
to
me
is
that
his
philosophy
seems
pretty
similar
to
mine
He
doesn't
seem
phased
by
admitting
that
life
is
complicated
and
that
there
are
elements
of
truth
in
various
different
approaches
to
any
given
issue
Last
night
he
discussed
how
Democrats
have
to
remember
that
funding
worthy
programs
doesn't
solve
all
of
our
problems
echoing
a
common
campaign
line
about
how
parents
have
to
be
the
ones
to
turn
off
the
TV
and
ensure
that
a
kid
is
doing
her
homework
He
ended
this
segment
by
saying
Individual
responsibility
and
mutual
responsibility
that's
the
essence
of
America's
promise
In
this
regard
Obama
carries
the
mantle
of
Bill
Clinton's
New
Democrat
approach
and
it
is
strange
that
he
hasn't
gotten
more
credit
for
the
centrist/third
way
nature
of
many
of
his
policy
proposals
This
line
showed
that
Obama
is
going
to
punch
back
If
John
McCain
wants
to
have
a
debate
about
who
has
the
temperament
and
judgment
to
serve
as
the
next
commander
in
chief
that's
a
debate
I'm
ready
to
have
As
far
as
I'm
concerned
it's
fair
game
once
your
opponent
has
taken
some
of
the
shots
McCain
has
Now
during
the
next
week
or
so
everyone
out
there
who
is
not
a
political
junkee
will
be
hearing
about
McCain's
legendary
temper
for
the
first
time
The
combination
of
his
neoconservative
foreign
policy
outlook
his
horrible
temper
and
strange
behavior
like
the
Bomb
bomb
bomb
bomb
bomb
Iran
moment
could
combine
to
create
an
insurmountable
hurdle
for
McCain
Finally
Pat
Buchanan
says
that
Obama's
speech
was
the
greatest
convention
acceptance
speech
he's
ever
heard
Say
what
you
will
about
most
of
his
policy
stances
but
Buchanan
is
a
hell
of
political
analyst
and
understands
American
politics
as
well
as
anyone
And
if
anything
the
fact
that
Buchanan
has
often
been
outside
of
the
mainstream
is
probably
one
reason
he
comes
across
as
more
honest
than
most
analysts
I
agree
with
him
completely
that
this
was
a
deeply
centrist
speech
The
clip
would
be
worth
watching
merely
for
the
expression
on
his
liberal
counterpart

Bill
Clinton
comes
around
Bill
Clinton
was
great
tonight
especially
when
he
pointed
out
that
critics
had
also
said
he
was
too
young
and
inexperienced
when
he
ran
in
1992
Obama
is
actually
forty-seven
a
year
older
than
Clinton
was
when
he
won
Biden's
introduction
bolstered
the
argument
I've
been
making
that
Biden's
appeal
to
older
white
Democrats
may
be
almost
as
important
as
his
foreign
policy
cred
His
middle-class
Catholic
upbringing
and
often-imperfect
life
story
childhood
stuttering
the
tragic
loss
of
his
wife
and
daughter
right
after
his
first
Senate
race
and
though
it
wasn't
mentioned
his
failed
1988
Presidential
bid
serve
as
excellent
foils
for
Obama's
multicultural
background
and
his
meteoric
rise
Biden
comes
across
as
incredibly
real
and
human
and
his
beaming
mother
probably
won
the
ticket

Hillary
hits
a
home
run
Hillary
Clinton's
speech
at
the
Democratic
National
Convention
was
right
on
target
including
pretty
much
everything
she
needed
to
say
The
most
important
part
was
when
she
asked
her
die-hard
supporters
what
the
rest
of
us
have
wanted
to
say
for
several
months
I
want
you
to
ask
yourselves
Were
you
in
this
campaign
just
for
me
Or
were
you
in
it
for
that
young
Marine
and
others
like
him
Were
you
in
it
for
that
mom
struggling
with
cancer
while
raising
her
kids
Were
you
in
it
for
that
young
boy
and
his
mom
surviving
on
the
minimum
wage
Were
you
in
it
for
all
the
people
in
this
country
who
feel
invisible
CNN
Part
of
me
keeps
asking
wait
isn't
this
what
anyone
else
in
her
position
would
have
been
saying
for
the
last
two
months
instead
of
letting
this
whole
rift
fester
Can
you
imagine
how
the
party
and
the
media
would
have
treated
Obama
if
he
had
come
in
second
and
acted
the
same
way
As
Ben
Smith
noted
the
negativity
coming
from
the
Clinton
camp
and
its
surrogates
in
the
days
leading
up
to
the
speech
made
it
a
study
in
the
virtue
of
low
expectations
But
whether
or
not
one
thinks
Clinton
should
have
handled
the
last
two
months
differently
she
deserves
credit
for
a
great
speech
last
night
And
after
all
the
next
two
months
are
much
more
important
than
the
last
two
If
she
and
Bill
keep
fighting
for
the
Obama-Biden
ticket
the
way
she
did
last
night
all
of
the
strife
will
be
forgotten
and
their
roles
among
the
Democratic
Party's
leadership
will
be
restored

Selected

articles
I
don't
have
time
for
an
extended
discussion
of
the
many
ways
Biden
strengthens
the
Democratic
ticket
and
I
already
gave
some
of
them
last
week
but
I
wanted
to
link
to
a
couple
of
articles
that
help
convey
Biden's
experience
and
especially
his
foreign
policy
expertise
The
long
New

article
from
2004
is
the
must-read
article
of
the
three
an
extended
George
Packer
piece
on
soft
power
and
the
potential
for
a
reinvigorated
liberal
approach
to
foreign
policy
The
WSJ
op-ed
features
the
former
US
ambassador
to
Romania's
take
on
Biden
Finally
David
Brooks
made
the
case
for
Biden
in
his
NYT
column
from
the
morning
before
the
announcement
and
for
once
he
was
right
about
what
would
happen

Who's
the
out-of-touch
elitist
now
Potential
VP
Tim
Kaine
ridiculed
John
McCain
today
for
not
being
able
to
answer
when
reporters
asked
him
how
many
houses
he
owns
Painting
McCain
as
a
quintessential
Country
Club
Republican
is
probably
the
Dems
best
counterattack
to
the
charge
that
Obama
is
elitist
or
out-of-touch
with
working
class
Americans
which
was
already
an
iffy
approach
for
McCain
giving
the
historical
economic
status
of
most
black
Americans
This
approach
would
also
help
focus
the
campaign
on
GOP
economic
policies
that
favor
the
extremely
wealthy
like
shifting
the
tax
burden
to
the
middle
class
and
the
deregulation
of
the
home
loan
market
And
it
shouldn't
be
too
hard
to
brand
McCain
with
the
Country
Club
Republican
label
once
the
media
starts
to
cover
the
candidates
financial
statements
how
many
of
the
mavericks
you
know
are
independently
wealthy

they
