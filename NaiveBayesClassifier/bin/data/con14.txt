It
has
been
a
while
since
I
last
blogged
about
anything
But
I
have
recently
been
stirred
back
to
life
With
Russia's
invasion
of
Georgia
last
week
I
find
myself
roused
from
my
blog-sleep
Late
last
week
Russia
invaded
the
independent
nation
of
Georgia
No
you
need
not
worry
about
any
relatives
in
Atlanta
or
Macon
It's
not
that
Georgia
The
Georgia
I'm
talking
about
was
an
independent
nation
before
it
was
gobbled
up
and
included
in
the
Union
of
Soviet
Socialist
Republics
USSR
and
following
the
USSR's
dissolution
it
is
once
again
independent
As
you
can
see
from
the
above
map
Georgia
is
on
the
eastern
banks
of
the
Black
Sea
Here
is
the
Russian
view
of
things
Prior
to
the
break-up
of
the
Soviet
Union
there
was
an
ethnically-defined
region
known
as
Ossetia
After
the
break-up
Ossetia
was
divided
between
Russia
and
Georgia
as
North
Russian
and
South
Georgian
Ossetia
Both
halves
of
Ossetia
as
well
as
neighboring
Abkhazia
have
strong
separatist
movements
that
seek
to
establish
separate
nations
of
Abkhazia
and
Ossetia
Prime
Minister
Vladimir
Putin
claims
that
Russia
has
a
vested
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
Ossetian
people
and
has
Russian
troops
in
North
Ossetia
to
maintain
order
in
that
region
So
when
Georgia
moved
troops
into
South
Ossetia
which
is
within
the
territorial
borders
of
Georgia
to
quell
violence
and
restore
order
Putin
used
this
as
a
pretext
on
which
to
invade
Georgia
and
help
the
Ossetian
people
there
There
are
a
couple
of
problems
with
Putin's
reasoning
insert
a
small
chuckle
here
First
Russia
has
no
real
interest
in
the
Ossetian
people
Ever
since
the
break-up
of
the
Soviet
Union
the
Ossetian
people
have
wanted
to
establish
their
own
independent
state
and
the
Russian
government
has
always
opposed
this
even
before
Putin
the
Russians
just
don't
like
the
idea
of
loosing
terroitory
regardless
of
how
little
it
may
effect
Russia
as
a
whole
Second
Georgia's
movement
into
Southern
Ossetia
was
a
relatively
quick
matter
a
matter
of
internal
politics
Russia
claims
that
it
acted
in
the
interests
of
the
Ossetian
peoples
only
after
Georgia's
actions
However
in
order
to
move
into
the
South
Ossetian
region
of
Georgia
Russia
had
to
cross
a
major
mountain
range
This
is
no
easy
matter
it
requires
a
grea
deal
of
advanced
planning
It
is
very
difficult
to
move
an
armored
force
over
mountainous
terrain
This
was
in
no
way
an
impromptu
action
The
crux
of
the
matter
is
that
Russia's
invasion
is
unvarnished
aggression
The
Russians
haven't
even
restrained
their
actions
to
South
Ossetia
but
have
moved
within
30
miles
of
the
Georgian
capitol
Tblisi
All
of
Russia's
excuses
are
transparent
What
should
be
the
American
reaction
What
a
question
It
is
generally
considered
that
the
American
people
have
no
stomach
for
any
further
military
action
We're
tired
of
war
But
are
we
tired
of
justice
Are
we
tired
to
stand
up
for
the
rights
of
others
Last
time
I
checked
America
was
the
country
of
the
little
guy
America
has
a
number
of
options
available
for
its
reactions
I
would
recommend
the
expulsion
of
Russia
from
the
G8
economic
forum
Dissolve
the
G8
and
re-form
it
without
Russia
Also
grant
Georgia's
request
for
membership
in
NATO
Membership
should
also
be
extended
to
Ukraine
which
may
follow
Georgia
as
a
target
for
Russian
aggression
Military
aid
as
well
as
humantiarian
assistance
should
be
sent
to
Georgia
At
the
very
least
the
U.S
should
provide
Georgia
with
intelligence
support
All
of
these
actions
should
accompany
attempts
to
get
European
and
United
Nations
political
and
economic
sanctions
in
place
Many
people
are
comparing
Russia's
actions
in
Georgia
to
America's
invasion
of
Iraq
in
2003
Saying
that
America
invaded
Iraq
on
similar
pretexts
But
this
couldn't
be
further
from
the
truth
America
invaded
Iraq
following
attacks
on
the
United
States
and
Iraq's
collaboration
with
the
attackers
But
what
do
you
think

Hindu
Experience
Category
Christianity
Musings
By
GotDesign
On
Saturday
my
wife
and
I
toured
a
Hindu
Temple
here
in
Louisville
It
was
a
truly
interesting
experience
Neither
my
wife
nor
I
had
much
knowledge
about
Hinduism
so
it
was
an
eye-opening
experience
The
Reader's
Digest
condensed
version
of
Hinduism
is
that
Hindus
are
seeking
the
Divine
read
god
in
the
world
around
us
They
believe
that
the
Divine
has
visited
earth
in
human
form
on
several
occasions
Vishnu
Ganesh
Shiva
Rama
and
even
Jesus
of
Nazareth
These
human
incarnations
called
avatars
not
to
be
confused
with
the
cartoon
on
Nickelodeon
are
god's
way
of
reaching
out
to
his
creation
Families
may
choose
to
worship
one
or
more
deities
individuals
choose
their
own
personal
deities
which
may
or
may
not
be
their
family's
deity
The
temple
itself
was
a
medium-sized
building
in
which
were
housed
shrines
to
various
Hindu
deities
Priests
went
about
the
business
of
performing
rites
and
ceremonies
for
worshipers
as
well
as
maintaining
the
statues
and
temple
facilities
While
I
cannot
of
course
agree
with
Hinduism
I
do
greatly
admire
their
devotion
to
spiritual
pursuits
Their
search
for
the
Divine
reminds
me
very
much
of
Dallas
Willard's
concept
of
the
Kingdom
Among
Us
I
believe
as
a
Christian
that
as
we
search
for
the
spiritual
presence
of
God
we
will
become
more
and
more
in
tune
with
His
spiritual
nature
and
therefore
more
able
to
submit
ourselves
to
His
Kingdom
Will
A
good
time
was
had

I
decided
to
walk
around
the
campus
of
the
University
of
Louisville
yesterday
This
is
the
pedestal
of
you
guessed
it
the
famous
The
Thinker
statue
Not
the
original
obviously
It
sits
in
front
of
a
set
of
stairs
leading
into
a
building
Due
to
the
recent
snows
the
university
had
Caution
tape
strung
up
preventing
access
to
the
stairs
I
took
this
shot
for
a
couple
reasons
1
the
fabulously
rich
colors
and
2
the
unintended
message
The
Thinker...Caution
In
my
opinion
the
universities
have
become
a
place
where
diversity
of
thought
is
discouraged
Universities
have
become
enclaves
of
liberal
ideology
No
longer
are
students
taught
how
to
think
and
reason
merely
how
to
parrot
what
they
are
told
by
professors
As
someone
who
considers
himself
somewhat
of
an
intellectual
this
trend
bothers
me
While
I
am
philosophically
conservative
I
encourage
people
to
seek
a
reason
behind
what
they
believe
not
just
spout
whatever
is
currently
en
vogue
Anyway
that's
my
opinion
What's
yours

It
started
snowing
yesterday
Now
you
should
know
that
I'm
a
huge
fan
of
snow
I
have
fond
memories
of
the
winters
of
my
youth
Today's
snows
are
paltry
by
comparison
So
when
it
started
snowing
yesterday
I
started
singing
the
Crosby
classic
Let
it
Snow
At
the
time
I
was
at
my
church
Southeast
Christian
Church
Then
at
about
6
pm
I
received
a
call
telling
me
that
the
Bible
Study
I
had
planned
to
attend
had
been
cancelled
As
I
had
been
at
the
church
since
about
10
am
the
news
just
meant
I
could
leave
at
6
pm
instead
of
at
8:30
pm
So
after
brushing
a
little
snow
off
the
headlights
I
hopped
in
my
car
On
the
highway
I
expected
it
to
be
a
slow
and
steady
trip
home
Normally
this
trip
would
take
me
about
20
minutes
or
so
depending
on
traffic
But
it
was
neither
slow
nor
steady
It
was
a
crawl
At
one
point
I
did
not
move
not
an
inch
for
45
minutes
I
left
the
church
at
6:20
pm
and
arrived
home
at
10
pm
That's
right
it
took
me
3-1/2
hours
to
get
home
Up
until
about
9
pm
I
was
taking
it
all
in
stride
I
was
still
in
the
joy
of
snow
Oh
the
weather
outside
is
freightful...(humming
along
I
even
thought
that
I
would
get
outside
my
car
and
throw
snowballs
at
the
traffic
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
highway
just
in
fun
not
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
were
moving
almost
unobstructed
I
was
even
imagining
if
I
was
getting
so
much
joy
from
the
snow
how
much
joy
was
God
getting
from
it
By
9
pm
my
rosy
disposition
was
in
the
trash
can
covered
in
coffee
grounds
At
almost
exactly
10
pm
I
pulled
my
VW
Jetta
into
my
garage
if
you
don't
have
a
garage
I
highly
recommend
them
I
walked
inside
shucked
off
my
coat
and
wrapped
my
arms
around
my
loving
wife
I
then
had
to
kill
12
suitors
shoot
an
arrow
through
the
loop
of
10
axe
heads
and
lift
the
living
tree
from
which
I
had
carved
my
bed
If
you
still
don't
get
the
references
please
read
The
Odyssey
Let's
just
say
that
I
was
glad
to
be
home
