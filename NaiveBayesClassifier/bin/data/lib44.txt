FOR

10
WAYS
YOU
CAN
BECOME
A
CHAMPION
FOR
CHANGE
Our
nation
is
suffering
from
a
crisis
of
democratic
expression
Many
Americans
are
in
a
state
of
deep
political
despair
The
belief
that
the
U.S
has
abandoned
principles
of
peace
and
tolerance
has
led
to
a
burgeoning
group
of
politically
disaffected
Americans
Some
citizens
have
decided
to
leave
the
U.S
in
response
to
the
results
of
the
2004
presidential
election
For
instance
a
recent
newspaper
article
in
a
major
newspaper
reported
that
the
number
of
U.S
citizens
applying
for
immigration
to
Canada
has
increased
by
approximately
threefold
this
year
The
disaffection
many
Americans
feel
towards
our
nation
can
be
resolved
if
every
citizen
becomes
fully
engaged
in
the
political
and
civic
affairs
of
the
nation
I
encourage
you
to
use
the
following
10
Strategies
in
your
community
to
reinvigorate
the
democratic
principles
our
nation
was
founded
on
1
START
SOMETHING
Joan
Blades
and
Wes
Boyd
decided
to
let
their
voices
be
heard
when
they
founded
MoveOn.org
Both
were
Silicon
Valley
entrepreneurs
and
had
no
previous
political
experience
in
1998
when
they
launched
MoveOn.org
Blades
and
Boyd
were
deeply
frustrated
about
the
partisan
warfare
occurring
as
a
result
of
the
Clinton
Impeachment
process
So
they
launched
an
online
petition
to
censure
President
Clinton
and
Move
On
to
pressing
issues
facing
the
nation
The
petition
mobilized
hundreds
of
thousands
of
Americans
and
a
movement
was
born
Today
MoveOn.org
is
an
Internet
based
nationwide
network
of
more
than
2,000,000
online
activists
who
mobilize
to
speak
their
opinion
on
issues
ranging
from
campaign
finance
to
the
war
in
Iraq

a
State
Representative
in
the
Texas
House
of
Representatives
Mr
Strama
has
been
involved
in
public
service
for

that
enabled
over
700,000
Americans

forms
online
during
the
2000
election
cycle

BECOME
THE
CHANGE
YOU
SEEK
James
Hodges
began
performing
motivational
speeches
as
George
Washington
in
the
community
approximately
eight
years
ago
with
the
goal
of
imparting
knowledge
about
their
leadership
principles
to
audiences
His
goal
is
to
inspire
audiences
to
become
the
most
effective
leaders
possible
Mr
Hodges
is
a
prime
example
of
becoming
the
change
you
seek
He
believed
past
American
Presidents
represented
the
epitome
of
leadership
He
acted
on
this
belief
and
models
the
success
of
these
leaders
as
a
way
to
inspire
people
to
confront
modern
challenges
and
become
leaders
for
the
21st
Century
4
BE
PROVOCATIVE
Michael
Moore
has
made
being
provocative
a
job
Mr
Moore
has
been
criticized
by
many
for
his
confrontational
style
However
he
has
been
successful
at
speaking
truth
to
power
Mr
Moore
uses
the
power
of
the
video-camera
to
chronicle
the
actions
of
leaders
He
challenges
the
policies
of
multinational
corporations
as
well
as
the
policies
of
the
United
States
government
5
SPEAK
UP
SPEAK
OUT
I
believe
that
citizens
must
always
use
the
power
of
their
voice
to
challenge
the
status
quo
I
contend
that
voting
is
the
most
effective
tool
to
speak
up
and
speak
out
to
those
in
power
I
decided
to
turn
my
beliefs
into
action
and
became
a
Deputy
Registrar
for
Travis
County
in
Austin
Texas
during
the
2004
Presidential
election
As
a
Deputy
Registrar
for
Travis
County
my
primary
duty
was
to
register
U.S
citizens
to
vote
I
worked
with
local
organizations
and
registered
individuals
at
parks
dance
clubs
and
community
events
Our
combined
efforts
resulted
in
approximately
10,000
new
voters
in
the
Central
Texas
Region
We
can
ensure
that
our
democracy
remains
vibrant
and
strong
by
encouraging
all
of
our
citizens
to
participate
at
all
levels
6
VOTE
OR
DIE
The
importance
of
voting
was
captured
during
the
2004
Presidential
election
by
the
slogan
Vote
or
Die
Sean
P
Diddy
Combs
businessman
entertainer
and
producer
successfully
used
the
slogan
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
voting
to
young
Americans
Mr
Combs
founded
a
national
non-partisan
and
non-profit
organization
called
Citizen
Change
in
2004
in
an
effort
to
educate
motivate
and
empower
young
Americans
According
to
its
founder
the
mission
of
Citizen
Change
is
to
make
voting
hot
sexy
and
relevant
to
a
generation
that
hasn't
reached
full
potential
in
the
political
progress
According
to
a
recent
story
in
Black
Enterprise
regarding
the
youth
vote
approximately
21
million
Americans
under
the
age
of
30
cast
their
votes
in
November
2004
which
was
an
increase
of
approximately
4.6
million
compared
to
the
2000
presidential
election
Hip-Hop
activists
were
able
to
make
voting
seem
cool
to
young
people
with
the
Vote
Or
Die
campaign
which
resulted
in
a
record
turnout
of
young
voters

THINK
BIG
Tommy

was
6
years
old
when
he
decided
to
campaign

world
peace
He
borrowed
454
dollars
from
a
Children's
Bank
and
created
1,000

Mikhael
Gorbachev
bought
his
bumper
stickers

created
a
project
which
benefited
the
entire
world

MAKE
A
WAY
OUT
OF
NO
WAY
Wangari
Maathai
is
a
prime
example
of
someone
who
makes
a
way
out
no
way
Ms
Maathai
was
awarded
the
Nobel
Peace
Prize
in
1994
for
her
efforts
as
an
environmentalist
tree
planter
and
activist
She
is
the
first
African
woman
to
receive
this
prestigious
award
Ms
Maathai
is
the
founder
of
the
Greenbelt
Movement
which
was
launched
in
the
1970's
The
Greenbelt
Movement
is
a
grassroots
environmental
effort
to
improve
Kenya's
environment
The
governments
of
Kenya
did
not
look
kindly
on
the
efforts
of
the
Greenbelt
Movement
often
threatening
and
jailing
Ms
Maathai
and
her
associates
However
Ms
Maathai
continued
her
efforts
and
has
managed
to
plant
over
30
million
trees
in
Kenya
Ms
Maathai
has
also
been
a
strong
proponent
for
women's
rights
She
has
also
been
elected
as
a
Member
of
Parliament
in
Kenya
where
she
continues
to
lobby
for
environmental
causes
and
the
rights
of
women
9
JUST
DO
IT
Candy
Lightner
knows
the
importance
of
the
phrase
Just
Do
It
Ms
Lightner
transformed
a
personal
tragedy
into
a
crusade
against
drunk
driving
in
the
United
States
She
founded
MADD
Mothers
Against
Drunk
Driving
in
1980
in
response
to
the
death
of
her
child
by
a
drunk
driver
MADD
is
a
non-profit
grassroots
organization
dedicated
to

driving
support
the
victims
of
this
violent
crime
and
prevent
underage
drinking
Ms
Lightner
continues
her
campaign
to
end
drunk
driving
by
giving
lectures
throughout
the
nation
Her
selfless
actions
have
been
credited
with
preventing
the
deaths
of
many
people
10
CREATE
THE
FUTURE
Julia
Butterfly
Hill
decided
to
create
the
future
by
engaging
in
an
act
of
civil
disobedience
In
1997
Ms
Hill
climbed
into
an
enormous
ancient
redwood
tree
she
nicknamed
Luna
in
Humboldt
County
California
She
constructed
a
tiny
platform
near
the
top
of
the
tree
and
resided
on
it
for
738
days
in
order
to
prevent
a
lumber
company
from
chopping
it
down
Her
vigilance
received
national
and
international
media
coverage
Ms
Hill's
actions
resulted
in
the
lumber
company
agreeing
not
to
cut
the
ancient
redwood
tree
she
dubbed
Luna
In
addition
the
timber
company
created
a
small
but
permanent
protective
area
around
the
ancient
redwood
and
others
trees
like
it
nearby
Ms
Hill
continues
to
champion
the
environment
as
a
public
speaker
She
is
also
the
founder
of
Circle
of
Life
a
not
for
profit
organization
dedicated
to
environmental
advocacy
President
Kennedy
once
said
Ask
not
what
your
country
can
do
for
you
ask
what
you
can
do
for
your
country
Our
nation
will
remain
strong
and
prosperous
only
if
citizens
participate
in
all
functions
of
governance
I
encourage
you
to
emulate
the
actions
of
the
aforementioned
individuals
in
your
community
As
the
Greek
philosopher
Plato
one
stated
Those
who
are
too
smart
to
engage
in
politics
are
punished
by
being
governed
by
those
who
are
dumber

A
New
Project
Encourages
African-American
Youth
to
Express
Themselves
through
Writing
Austin
Texas
A
new
grassroots
effort
called
the
Say
It
Loud
Project
seeks
the
opinions
of
the
next
generation
of
African-American
leaders
The
Say
It
Loud
Project
is
accepting
essays
from
African-American
youth
between
the
ages
of
17-25
years
old
that
focus
on
their
opinion
about
a
political
social
or
economic
issue
confronting
the
African-American
community
According
to
Richard
McNairy
creator
of
the
Say
It
Loud
Project
I
decided
to
invite
African
American
youth
to
write
an
essay
expressing
their
opinion
about
an
important
political
social
or
economic
issue
in
an
effort
to
capture
the
diverse
viewpoints
within
the
African-American
community
I
believe
it
is
very
important
for
young
African-Americans
to
express
their
opinions
about
important
issues
confronting
our
nation
I
am
very
interested
in
the
opinions
of
African
American
youth
in
regards
to
issues
such
as
the
War
in
Iraq
Social
Security
Higher
Education
HIV/AIDS
and
any
other
issues
a
young
person
would
like
to
write
about
I
think
all
too
often
mainstream
media
does
not
express
the
opinions
of
young
people
especially
African
American
youth
I
hope
the
Say
It
Loud
Project
will
inspire
African
American
youth
to
develop
their
writing
skills
and
use
them
to
influence
public
policy
in
our
nation
The
participation
of
young
Americans
in
all
aspects
of
the
political
economic
and
civic
affairs
of
our
nation
is
vital
According
to
the
recent
report
Vanishing
Voter
Election
2004
from
Harvard
University's
School
of
Government
approximately
5
million
more
young
people
voted
during
the
2004
presidential
election
as
compared
to
the
2000
election
The
report
proves
that
young
Americans
are
active
participants
in
the
political
and
civic
affairs
of
our
nation
The
Say
It
Loud
Project
is
committed
to
encouraging
young
African-Americans
to
remain
involved
in
the
political
and
civic
life
of
our
nation
African
Americans
between
the
ages
of
17-25
years
old
are
encouraged
to
submit
an
essay
which
expresses
their
opinion
about
a
significant
and
contemporary
political
social
or
economic
issue
Essayists
are
encouraged
to
submit
writings
that
reflect
their
creativity
and
passion
in
regards
to
the
topic
The

YOUNG
AFRICAN

SPEAK

YOUNG
AFRICAN
AMERICANS
SPEAK
OUT
I
am
launching
a
new
project
today
which
will
focus
on
providing
an
outlet
for
the
opinions
of
African-Americans
between
the
ages
of
17-25
years
old
My
goal
is
to
collect
essays
written
by
young
African
Americans
which
focus
on
their
opinions
about
important
political
social
and
economic
issues
confronting
the
African
American
community
I
plan
to
publish
the
essays
as
a
book
in
early
2006
I
know
that
young
Americans
are
deeply
committed
to
participating
in
the
political
and
civic
affairs
of
our
nation
According
to
Harvard
University
School
of
Government's
Vanishing
Voter
2004
Election
Report
approximately
5
million
more
young
adults
voted
in
2004
than
in
2000
I
believe
this
is
encouraging
news
for
our
nation
The
opinions
of
African
American
youth
have
been
consistently
ignored
by
traditional
mass
media
outlets
I
have
launched
this
project
as
a
means
of
rectifying
this
situation
I
intend
to
contact
HBCU's(Historically
Black
Colleges
and
Universities
African-American
newspapers
Majority
Populated
Colleges
and
Universities
and
other
organizations
in
an
effort
to
spread
the
word
about
the
project
The
essays
will
be
collated
into
a
book
which
will
be
published
in
early
2006
The
project
seeks
essays
from
African
Americans
between
the
ages
of
17-25
years
old
and
who
are
currently
in
high
school
or
college
The
topic
of
the
essay
can
fall
in
one
of
the
following
categories
Politics
Social
Issue
Economic
Issue
The
essay
can
be
in
any
length
you
desire
but
should
express
your
opinion
about
a
political
social
or
economic
issue
confronting
the
African
American
community
All

No
I
don't
mean
the
end
is
near
I
mean
the
end
is
nigh
as
in
the

already
here
According
to
various
news
reports
Howard
Dean
was
elected
to
the
position
of
Chairman
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee
I
know
that
Deaniacs

I
am
chagrined
I
received
an

from
Dr
Howard
Dean
early
this
morning
Really
I'm
not
joking
The
email
was
a
mass
email
sent
to
all
of
the
DNC
loyalists
The
email
stated
that
he
is
happy
to
be
Chair
and
wants
me
to
know
that
the
new

will
be
all
about
inclusion
and
loyalty

I
rolled

I
quickly
hit

I
think
I
was
spammed
by
Dr
Howard
Dean
Anyway
I'm
still
leaving

I
have
been
wanting
to
leave
the

got
distracted
Well

hang
around

a
little
while
longer

FUTURE
FORUM
EVENT
FUTURE
FORUM
EVENT
I
attended
an
event
last
night
hosted
by
the
Future
Forum
which
featured
several
young
Members
of
the
Texas
House
of
Representatives
I
am
a
member
of
the
Future
Forum
which
is
an
organization
comprised
of
young
people
and
others
interested
in
increasing
the
civil
participation
of
Americans
The
Future
Forum
hosts
a
variety
of
events
throughout
the
year
which
focus
on
educating
the
public
about
important
public
policy
issues
I
enjoyed
speaking
with
and
listening
to
these
legislators
talk
about
issues
ranging
from
school
finance
to
healthcare
I
also
got
a
chance
to
learn
firsthand
what
it
takes
to
raise
the
money
to
become
an
elected
official
The
Texas
Legislature
is
currently
in
session
and
only
meets
every
other
year
which
I
think
is
bizarre
However
Texans
pride
themselves
on
their
form
of
small
government
The
problems
is
that
this
state
has
a
population
of
20
million
people
and
is
continuing
to
grow
I
think
that
meeting
every
two
years
for
approximately
6
months
or
more
if
the
governor
calls
a
special
session
is
an
antiquated
way
to
handle
the
people's
business
of
Texas
The
citizens
of
Texas
should
demand
that
the
legislature
meet
for
a
full
year
every
other
year
in
an
effort
to
properly
conduct
state
business
Hey
it's
just
and
idea

DON'T
MOVE
TO
CANADA
DON'T
MOVE
TO
CANADA
FIGHT
BACK
I
read
a
story
in
the
New
York
Times
yesterday
which
featured
Americans
that
have
decided
to
move
to
Canada
in
reaction
to
the
re-election
of
President
George
W
Bush
The
majority
of
individuals
featured
in
the
story
discussed
their
enmity
for
President
Bush
and
his
domestic
and
foreign
policies
I
want
to
encourage
those
folks
to
unpack
their
bags
and
join
the
fight
I
would
also
encourage
them
to
review
the
history
of
our
nation
Our
nation
was
built
by
fighters
and
dissenters
George
Washington
Abraham
Lincoln
and
Ulysses
S
Grant
were
all
fighters
The
United
States
of
America
is
a
nation
of
dissenters
We
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
famous
dissenters
such
as
Dr
Martin
Luther
King
Jr
John
Brown
and
Susan
B
Anthony
Americans
must
stand
up
and
let
our
voices
be
heard
Our
nation
will
never
realize
its
greatness
if
its
best
and
brightest
run
at
the
earliest
sign
of
trouble
I
urge
all
of
my
fellow
Americans
to
heed
the
words
of
Bob
Marley
Stand
Up
Stand
Up
For
Your
Rights
I
understand
that
many
people
are
discouraged
and
disheartened
by
the
actions
of
the
Bush
administration
I
understand
that
many
of
my
fellow
Americans
do
not
want
to
pay
taxes
to
a
government
that
engages
in
immoral
activities
around
the
globe
I
urge
you
to
stand
exactly
where
you
are
and
take
action
I
encourage
you
to
remain
in
the
United
States
and
become
involved
in
the
political
organization
of
your
choice
or
start
your
own
political/social
organization
Our
nation
and
world
is
experiencing
a
great
deal
of
turmoil
We
need
your
talents
your
voices
and
your
passion
I
hope
that
the
individuals
featured
in
that
story
and
others
who
agree
with
their
actions
will
reconsider
their
decision
to
leave
the
United
States
The
bottom
line
is
that
you
cannot
run
from
your
responsibility
or
duty
as
an
American
and
citizen
of
the
world
We
each
have
a
duty
to
share
our
gifts
with
the
world
and
to
make
certain
that
our
light
shines
even
in
the
darkest
hour
I
know
many
people
believe
that
the
United
States
is
a
nation
that
has
lost
its
way
However
I
believe
that
a
nation
is
only
a
reflection
of
its
people
I
urge
all
Americans
to
join
in
the
effort
to
return
the
United
States
to
its
state
of
glory

IT'S
ALMOST
OVER
IT'S
ALMOST
OVER
I
read
that
the
last
competitor
to
Dr
Howard
Dean
to
become
Chair
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee
has
dropped
out
of
the
race
The
reality
is
that
Dr
Dean
may
be
the
only
person
interested
in
becoming
Chair
of
the
DNC
I
only
have
one
question-"Where
is
Bill
Clinton
I
thought
the
DNC
was
his
party
Where
is
Senator
Hillary
Clinton
Is
no
one
able
to
stand
up
to
the
power
of
Dr
Dean
I
promise
you
folks
that
I
will
leave
the
Democratic
Party
if
Dr
Howard
Dean
becomes
the
next
Chair
of
the
DNC
I
have
been
considering
becoming
an
independent
for
some
time
now
Dr
Dean's
ascendancy
to
the
Chair
of
the
DNC
will
confirm
the
rightness
of
my
actions
The
DNC
can
barely
win
local
elections
in
2005
I
do
not
believe
that
Dr
Howard
Dean
has
the
experience
to
lead
the
party
to
victory
in
any
given
year
The
fact
that
he
was
able
to
create
an
internet
based
network
of
voters
is
not
enough
evidence
that
he
can
influence
independent
voters
nor
the
traditional
base
of
the
DNC
to
vote
for
democratic
candidates
What
are
the
powers
that
be
thinking
I
urge
you
to
stay
tuned
I
will
have
a
lot
more
to
say
about
this
issue
in
the
days
to
come
