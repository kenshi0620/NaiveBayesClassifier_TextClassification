DeLay's
history
lesson
Don
Herzog
June
9
2006
The
press
is
chortling
over
Tom
DeLay's
farewell
to
the
House
of
Representatives
DeLay
congratulated
himself
for
standing
up
for
freedom
and
dignity
he
regretted
only
not
fighting
harder
But
what
caught
my
eye
was
this
comment
courtesy
of
the
Congressional
Quarterly
Liberalism
after
all
whatever
you
may
think
of
its
merits
is
a
political
philosophy
and
a
proud
one
with
a
great
tradition
in
this
country
with
a
voracious
appetite
for
growth
In
any
place
or
any
time
on
any
issue
what
does
liberalism
ever
seek
Mr
Speaker
More
more
government
more
taxation
more
control
over
people's
lives
and
decisions
and
wallets
You'd
never
dream
that
liberals
fought
to
stop
the
state
from
meddling
with
religion
You'd
never
dream
that
they
campaigned
against
such
intrusions
as
the
hearth
tax
which
required
the
tax
collector
to
burst
into
your
house
to
count
up
the
fireplaces
You'd
never
dream
that
liberals
championed
the
right
of
consenting
adults
to
do
what
they
want
in
their
bedrooms
DeLay
might
be
in
the
clutches
of
a
wildly
polemical
misreading
of
LBJ's
Great
Society
Or
he
might
be
throwing
a
smokescreen
over
the
social
agenda
of
some
of
today's
conservatives
aghast
at
the
thought
that
the
state
has
nothing
to
do
with
religion
or
consensual
sex
Let's
just
hope
he
doesn't
decide
to
teach
history
or
political
theory
for
his
next
job

Government
and
Religion
Steven
Shiffrin
May

On
Prawfsblog
Rick
Garnett
takes
the
view
that
I
certainly
share
Marty
Lederman]'s
and
Madison's
concern
about
religious
faith
being
reduced
to
a
convenient
means
for
achieving
the
government's
secular
ends
That
said
I'm
not
sure
why
it
should
be
unconstitutional
or
in
any
event
why
it
would
be
profoundly
disturbing
for
the
government
as
a
general
matter
to
take
and
act
on
in
non-coercive
ways
of
course
and
consistent
with
the
freedom
of
conscience
the
view
that
religious
transformation
and
faith
are
good
when
freely
embraced
It
is
not
clear
to
me
that
an
announcement
by
government
that
religious
faith
is
good
without
any
accompanying
action
is
unconstitutional
though
I
think
we
would
have
a
better
Constitution
if
it
were
I
think
it
might
well
be
constitutional
because
it
is
constitutional
for
the
government
to
put
In
God
We
Trust
on
the
Coins
to
say
God
Save
the
United
States
and
This
Honorable
Court
and
to
issue
a
Pledge
of
Allegiance
Under
God
I
think
these
practices
affirm
religion
over
non-religion
and
monotheism
over
non-monotheism
And
I
think
that
claims
that
the
motto
the
prayer
and
the
Pledge
are
non-religious
lack
integrity
I
argue
this
in
The
Pluralistic
Foundations
of
the
Religion
Clauses
90
Cornell
L.Rev
95
2004
Michael
Perry
also
argues
this
in
a
forthcoming
article
in
St.Thomas
and
I
believe
he
has
also
expressed
the
view
in
print
previously
as
well
I
think
a
government
statement
to
the
effect
that
religion
is
good
might
cross
a
line
in
it
that
might
be
encouraging
religion
and
that
is
unconstitutional
I
certainly
do
not
think
that
government
is
entitled
under
the
Establishment
Clause
to
proselytize
thus
intelligent
design
can
not
be
taught
in
the
schools
and
it
is
not
entitled
to
say
what
God
has
to
say
about
any
subject
it
should
be
inappropriate
for
government
to
post
versions
of
the
Ten
Commandments
Whatever
its
constitutionality
I
would
find
it
disturbing
for
government
to
announce
that
religious
faith
is
good
let
alone
to
act
on
it
First
I
think
government
neutrality
on
this
subject
is
more
respectful
of
citizens
who
disagree
I
do
not
believe
that
a
person's
religion
or
lack
of
it
should
have
any
bearing
on
their
relationship
to
the
state
Statements
like
these
including
In
God
We
Trust
mark
out
two
classes
of
citizens
those
who
do
not
trust
in
God
are
not
part
of
the
We
They
are
marked
as
outsiders
Just
as
important
I
do
not
trust
government
to
help
religion
I
believe
that
close
ties
with
government
have
hurt
the
Church
in
Europe
The
Church
made
the
horrible
mistake
of
thinking
that
close
ties
with
monarchs
Vichy
France
Salazar
Franco
Mussolini
and
the
like
would
be
good
for
the
Church
This
not
only
interfered
with
the
kind
of
witnessing
that
was
called
for
It
put
the
Church
on
the
wrong
side
of
history
in
the
eyes
of
millions
of
Europeans
Close
ties
with
government
risk
alliances
with
corruption
and
dependency
I
do
not
maintain
that
phrases
like
In
God
We
Trust
have
hurt
religion
much
though
it
has
robbed
the
phrase
of
spirituality
and
has
married
religion
with
money
at
the
same
time
it
asserts
a
theological
proposition
but
it
is
hard
for
me
to
imagine
that
they
help
It
may
be
that
demagogic
politicians
might
try
to
curry
favor
by
saying
that
In
God
We
Trust
needs
to
be
put
on
the
currency
or
to
forge
alliances
with
merchants
in
highlighting
Christmas
a
special
form
of
blasphemy
But
I
believe
religion
can
get
along
quite
well
I
am
sure
Rick
does
too
without
government
announcements
that
religious
faith
is
good
There
is
a
special
irony
here
Religious
conservatives
ordinarily
are
suspicious
of
government
in
a
broad
swath
of
areas
but
they
seem
comfortable
with
government
promoting
religion
I
have
no
basis
to
assume
that
Rick
is
part
of
this
irony
I
am
genuinely
curious
as
to
why

I'm

No
I

Someone

signed
me
up
shortly
after
I
started

Hey
if

Mr

I
clicked
on
the

in

got
sent

a

story
reporting
on
the
sentiments
of
John
Whitehead
lawyer
and
head
of
the
Rutherford
Institute
I
confess
I
was
startled
by
this
understated
claim
The
central
issue
in
the
debate
the
pro-family
legal
advocate
contends
is
the
question
of
whether
Christians
are
going
to
be
able
to
say
Jesus
name
in
public
in
America
And
if
you
want
to
be
able
to
do
that
he
says
you're
going
to
have
to

Today's
front-page
banner
headline
from
the
Detroit
News
screams
PROFESSORS
PAID
NOT
TO
TEACH
I
confess
I
was
briefly
puzzled
wow
I
thought
some
people
teach
so
badly
that
they
get
paid
to
stay
out
of
the
classroom
Okay
so
I
hadn't
yet
had
enough
caffeine
I
quickly
realized
that
the
actual
story
is
about
sabbaticals
The
state's
public
universities
have
different
sabbatical
policies
But
a
routine
policy
runs
this
way
for
every
six
years
of
teaching
you
may
apply
for
either
a
year
off
at
half
pay
or
a
semester
off
at
full
pay
The
News
reports
that
about
23
million
a
year
goes
to
funding
these
sabbaticals
and
they
remind
the
reader
that
in-state
tuition
has
been
steadily
climbing
Yes
they
acknowledge
public
universities
have
lots
of
revenue
sources
besides
tuition
and
allocations
from
the
state
But
still
There's
no
point
huffing
and
puffing
about
philistines
in
response
to
such
stories
If
public
universities
can't
tell
a
persuasive
story
about
what
they're
doing
they
should
properly
expect
to
answer
to
their
partial
paymasters

A
recent
New
York
Times
has
a
quote
from
Steven
Levitt
the
freakonomics
professor
As
an
economist
I
am
better
than
the
typical
person
at
figuring
out
whether
abortion
reduces
crime
but
I
am
no
better
than
anyone
else
at
figuring
out
whether
abortion
is
murder
or
whether
a
woman
has
an
intrinsic
right
to
control
over
her
body
My
thoughts
after
reading
this
included
the
following
First
it's
nice
to
see
an
academic
being
frank
about
what
his
expertise
does
or
does
not
qualify
him
to
opine
about
Being
a
political
theorist
does
not
make
one's
views
about
the
significance
of
the
Hamas
victorymore
likely
to
be
accurate
than
the
speculations
of
a
literary
theorist
It
may
be
true
that
the
former
has
paid
somewhat
more
attention
to
Middle
East
politics
than
the
latter
and
that
may
reflect
something
about
the
interests
of
those
in
the
respective
disciplines
but
the
content
of
their
discipline
does
not
make
one
more
qualified
than
the
other
The
second
thought
was
would
the
inverse
statement
be
true
for
a
moral
philosopher
As
a
philosopher
I
am
better
than
the
typical
person
at
figuring
out
whether
abortion
is
murder
of
whether
a
woman
has
an
intrinsic
right
to
control
over
her
body
but
I
am
not
better
than
anyone
else
in

Catholic

and
the
Vagina
Monologues
Steven
Shiffrin
February

2006
Freedom
is
freedom
for
truth
Error
has
no
rights
This
was
the
perspective
of
the
Catholic
Church
for
many
centuries
It
was
used
to
support
censorship
and
persecution
in
many
countries
The
same
perspective
was
employed
by
Protestant
countries
for
the
same
purposes
and
by
non-religious
dictatorships
The
freedom
was
the
same
the
truth
was
different
At
least
with
respect
to
the
actions
of
government
Vatican
II
changed
the
perspective
of
the
Church
Vatican
II
respects
the
dignity
of
the
individual
and
his
or
her
freedom
to
make
religious
choices
It
respects
the
right
of
individuals
to
choose
error
but
hopes
to
lead
them
toward
its
conception
of
truth
Liberal
Catholics
believe
that
individuals
should
enjoy
the
same
freedom
with
respect
to
Church
teaching
They
should
for
example
have
been
free
to
maintain
that
religious
freedom
was
demanded
by
appropriate
conceptions
of
human
dignity
when
Church
teaching
was
to
the
contrary
Traditional
Catholics
believe
that
the
freedom
publicly
to
oppose
Vatican
teachings
by
Catholics
should
be
restricted
and
that
freedom
of
conscience
within
the
Church
is
freedom
for
truth
The
question
of
what
it
should
mean
to
be
a
Catholic
university
gets
much
discussion
in
Catholic
circles
Among
other
things
I
think
such
universities
should
be
able
to
assure
a
dominant
presence
of
Catholic
faculty
in
relevant
subject
areas
But
I
do
not
think
it
should
be
the
goal
of
the
administration
of
such
universities
to
eliminate
all
error
from
their
campuses
nor
do
I
believe
any
administration
is
committed
to
doing
so
Nonetheless
I
do
think
the
Church
has
a
bad
record
in
this
regard
Charles
Curran
should
be
teaching
at
a
Catholic
university
so
should
Hans
Kung
The
point
is
not
that
Curran
and
Kung
were
right
on
most
points
I
think
they
are
the
point
is
that
their
perspectives
need
to
be
discussed
and
debated
in
a
Catholic
university
That
debate
will
be
sharper
if
the
best
advocates
of
their
position
are
in
Catholic
universities
I
have
two
points
to
make
about
the
Vagina
Monologues
which
has
most
prominently
been
restricted
at
Notre
Dame
First
if
you
want
to
encourage
students
and
members
of
the
general
public
to
see
the
Vagina
Monologues
tell
students
they
can
not
have
the
show
on
campus
or
otherwise
limit
the
ability
to
see
the
show
Students
and
other
citizens
who
would
never
have
thought
to
see
such
a
production
will
rush
to
see
it
But
generously
understood
I
assume
the
real
point
of
opposing
the
Vagina
Monologues
was
to
send
the
message
that
a
particular
university
is
a
Catholic
university
I
think
the
better
way
to
do
that
is
education
The
better
way
is
to
publicly
discuss
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
the
Vagina
Monologues
from
a
Catholic
perspective
A
public
image
of
censorial
tendencies
is
not
good
for
Catholic
education
and
censorial
Catholic
education
is
not
good
education

Constitutional
Rights
February

2006
Our
constitution
is
color-blind
and
neither
knows
nor
tolerates
classes
among
citizens
So
Justice
Harlan
wrote
in
his
stirring
dissent
in
Plessy
v
Ferguson
Harlan
added
that
the
Reconstruction
amendments
removed
the
race
line
from
our
governmental
systems
That
stirring
language
has
been
the
mantra
of
those
opposed
to
affirmative
action
There's
other
language
in
Harlan's
dissent
that
suggests
he
worried
not
about
any
and
all
race-conscious
legislation
but
about
legislation
subordinating
blacks
So
for
instance
he
referred
to
state
laws
conceived
in
hostility
to
and
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
humiliating
citizens
of
the
United
States
of
a
particular
race
And
so
today's
patrons
of
affirmative
action
too
can
claim
Harlan
as
their
own
I've
been
thinking
about
these
matters
again
because
of
the
Michigan
Civil
Rights
Initiative
on
the
ballot
for
this
coming
November
after
ridiculous
skirmishing
about
the
legality
of
the
language
and
the
petition
signatures
Here
is
the
key
court
opinion
The
Initiative
would
ban
the
University
of
Michigan
from
using
race
sex
color
ethnicity
or
national
origin
so
amusingly
not
sexual
orientation
in
admissions
Since
I'm
a
reluctant
but
firm
supporter
of
affirmative
action
I'm
opposed
Obviously
color-blindness
has
its
appeal
And
it's
not
quite
enough
to
say
that
in
a
more
just
society
it
would
be
the
right
way
to
go
because
it
has
its
appeal
for
us
here
now
Still
I
think
it's
a
bludgeon
of
sorts
where
we
need
scalpels
So
I
want
to
step
back
a
moment
and
consider
the
recent
race
riots
in
a
jail
outside
Los
Angeles
In
response
authorities
are
segregating
prisoners
by
race
Not
a
moment
too
soon
So
how
awful
is
it
for
the
state
to
do
that
How
important
a
justification
do
they
need

What
Game
Would
You
Rather
Play

Let's
conduct
a
thought
experiment
You
have
to
play
a
mountain-climbing
game
The
higher
you
climb
the
better
off
you
are
Rarely
players
climb
solo
Most
of
the
time
they
climb
in
teams
The
members
of
each
team
are
connected
by
pulleys
and
gears
in
such
a
way
that
if
everyone
climbs
in
a
cooperative
fashion
everyone
in
the
team
goes
higher
than
if
each
just
climbed
the
team
rope
in
an
uncoordinated
way
The
job
of
the
team
leaders--those
highest
on
the
rope--is
to
figure
out
how
to
get
everyone
to
coordinate
their
climbing
so
as
to
get
the
maximum
total
lifting
force
for
the
whole
team
However
depending
on
the
gear
setup
the
lifting
force
of
each
member's
step
may
accrue
unequally
to
each
team
member
In
most
setups
those
at
the
top
get
lifted
higher
by
any
team
member's
step
than
anyone
below
The
mountain
face
is
swept
by
gales
although
the
winds
tend
to
be
milder
at
higher
altitudes
than
at
lower
ones
Sometimes
the
gales
blow
you
or
even
your
whole
team
off
your
rope
Other
times
the
team
leaders--those
at
the
top
of
the
team
rope--eject
you
from
the
team
and
toss
you
off
the
team
rope
If
you
are
lucky
your
mountain-climbing
skills
may
be
attractive
enough
to
another
team
that
they
extend
you
a
part
of
their
team
rope
before
you
hit
the
ground
Or
you
will
have
family
or
friends
who
will
toss
you
a
saftey
rope
to
catch
you
on
your
way
down
But
you
may
not
find
a
team
with
an
open
place
on
their
rope
that
they
will
offer
you
and
you
may
not
have
family
or
friends
willing
to
offer
a
rope
or
the
rope
they
are
able
to
offer
may
be
too
frail
to
stop
your
fall
You
don't
know
your
initial
place
on
your
rope
nor
which
rope
it
is
nor
your
mountain-climing
skills
nor
how
well-off
benevolent
and
numerous
your
family
and
friends
are
In
this
state
of
ignorance
you
get
to
choose
some
of
the
rules
of
the
game
you
must
play
Which
rules
would
you
prefer
to
play
by
Here
are
your
choices

What
can
be
done
to
control
health
care
costs
while
extending
access
to
care
to
the
uninsured
The
Bush
Administration's
strategy
is
to
move
health
insurance
from
comprehensive
to
catastrophic
coverage
and
make
sick
people
pay
out-of-pocket
for
less-than-catastrophic
costs
They
would
get
some
assistance
in
the
form
of
tax-sheltered
health
savings
accounts
in
which
they
could
deposit
funds
up
to
the
amount
of
their
deductible
dedicated
solely
to
health
care
expenditures
Nifty
idea
Not
according
to
Paul
Krugman
who
argues
in
his
January
16
2006
column
that
this
scheme
creates
perverse
incentives
to
insurers
to
withhold
coverage
of
routine
preventive
care
for
people
with
chronic
illnesses
such
as
diabetes
even
if
this
leads
to
medical
catastrophe
later
on
T]he
administration
is
saying
that
we
need
to
make
sure
that
insurance
companies
pay
only
for
things
like
30,000
amputations
that
they
don't
pay
for
150
visits
to
podiatrists
that
might
have
averted
the
need
for
amputation
That's
the
supply
side
What
about
the
demand
side
Do
workers
of
modest
means
find
health
saving
accounts
helpful
One
administrator
told
me
of
her
experience
when
her
firm
started
offering
tax-sheltered
dependent-care
and
health-care
savings
accounts
she
was
responsible
for
explaining
this
new
benefit
to
the
employees
She
saw
them
as
wonderful
opportunities
to
save
money
and
actively
promoted
them
to
the
staff

Update
Sorry
I
did
not
mean
to
post
anonymously
When
I
first
began
blogging
on
L2R
I
had
comments
enabled
This
seemed
to
me
the
appropriate
action
to
take
in
a
blog
which
aimed
at
stimulating
discussion
among
various
viewpoints
I
was
then
quite
shocked
perhaps
somewhat
naively
to
discover
the
nature
of
many
of
the
comments
to
my
blogs
They
were
rude
abusive
off
the
point
and
not
helpful
in
advancing
the
discussion
It
was
also
the
case
that
a
small
number
of
commentators
contributed
many
more
posts
than
the
average
And
these
were
not
the
most
useful
I
decided
to
disable
comments
This
caused
a
number
of
potential
commentators
to
e-mail
me
and
accuse
me
of
hypocrisy
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
many
of
my
comments
were
about
free
speech
Ward
Churchill
etc
It
even
turned
out
that
one
kind
soul
opened
a
website
of
his
own
designed
to
allow
those
who
wished
to
comment
on
my
remarks
To
the
best
of
my
knowledge
nobody
ever
availed
themselves
of
this
opportunity
perhaps
because
few
were
aware
of
it
A
number
of
fellow
L2R
authors
particularly
Don
and
Liz
continued
to
enable
comment
and
to
engage
in
discussion
I
do
not
think
that
their
choice
is
mistaken
and
mine
correct
I
do
not
think
that
there
is
a
single
answer
to
this
problem
Much
depends
on
one's
threshold
for
tolerance
of
stupid
and
abusive
views
on
what
thinks
is
the
point
of
the
blog
one
is
on
of
how
much
time
one
wants
to
allocate
to
answering
critics
on
the
range
of
people
and
views
that
one
thinks
it
is
realistic
to
expect
some
change
in
on
how
willing
one
is
to
censor
comments
before
they
appear
and
so
forth
But
the
recent
closing
of
the
Washington
Post
blog
of
ombudsoman
Deborah
Howell
is
a
good
illustration
of
the
hazards
of
public
discussion
on
the
Web
After
Howell
reported
that
Jack
Abramoff
had
made
substantial
campaign
contributions
to
both
major
parties
the
blog
was
deluged
with
hundreds
of
profane
sexist
and
hateful
comments
One
of
the
interesting
things
about
this
is
that
most
of
the
comments
came
from
various
leftist
blogs
and
groups
This
made
sense
since
her
comment
was
in
my
view
quite
misleading
Jack
Abramoff
never
gave
money
himself
to
any
Democratic
official
It
is
true
that
organizations
for
which
he
worked
did
so
and
that
is
a
relevant
thing
to
note
but
at
the
least
one
needs
some
evidence
and
some
exists
that
they
were
asked
to
do
so
by
Abramoff
But
the
relevant
criticisms
could
have
been
made
in
a
completely
civilized
manner
My
view
of
the
role
of
L2R
is
not
just
to
foster
discussion
but
to
foster
discussion
that
has
some
chance
of
leading
to
some
change
of
minds
whether
on
the
right
or
the
left
My
brief
exposure
to
comments
did
not
make
me
optimistic
that
allowing
them
would
facilitate
that
goal

in

point
to

She
mocks
MacKinnon's
decades-old
contention
that
all

intercourse
is
rape
Please
sisters
at

do
a
little
fact

preposterous
smears

this
University

Catharine

Here's
a
measure
of
how
much
a

despised
how
much
malicious
absurdity
can
one
ascribe
to
its
members
and
still
be
taken
as
a
credible
source
on
what
they
say
and
do
With
respect
to
feminists
the
answer
is
quite
a
lot
Christina
Hoff
Sommers
former
philosopher
and
professional
feminist
basher
has
been
widely
and
credulously
cited
for
her
critique
of
the
American
Association
of
University
Women's
report
How
Schools
Shortchange
Girls
although
my
fact-checking
finds
her
critique
riddled
with
errors
inconsistencies
and
misleading
claims
Many
academic
critics
of
feminist
philosophers
are
just
as
bad
often
to
the
point
of
ascribing
claims
to
feminists
that
are
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
they
say
Feminists
it
seems
are
not
entitled
to
a
minimally
charitable
or
even
literate
reading
of
what
they
say
Perhaps
this
is
to
be
expected
if
not
excused
of
those
who
wear
their
hatred
of
feminists
on
their
sleeves
But
for
feminists
themselves
to
fall
for
such
bashing

After
a
semester
hiatus
I
resume
my
series
of
posts
on
the
political
economy
of
a
free
society
Let's
take
up
the
issue
of
eminent
domain
through
the
controversial
Supreme
Court
case
Kelo
v
New
London
268
Conn
1
843
A
2d
500
which
affirmed
the
constitutionality
of
compulsory
state
transfers
of
private
property
to
other
private
owners
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
economic
development
The
case
has
sparked
a
lot
of
outrage
spurring
many
states
to
draft
laws
banning
state-enforced
private-to-private
transfers
of
property
I
think
the
outrage
is
misplaced
The
problem
with
the
current
construction
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain
is
not
that
it
permits
states
to
force
private-to-private
transfers
The
problem
is
rather
that
current
law
undercompensates
property
owners
for
such
takings

Bollinger
Academic
Freedom
and
Tolerance
Steven
Shiffrin
November
24
2005
Earlier
this
year
President
Lee
Bollinger
of
Columbia
University
gave
the
Cardozo
Lecture
to
the
Association
of
the
Bar
of
the
City
of
New
York
The
subject
was
academic
freedom
Bollinger
maintained
that
academic
freedom
included
academic
responsibilities
One
of
those
responsibilities
he
maintained
was
that
every
professor
was
to
cover
the
full
range
of
the
complexity
of
the
subject
in
every
course
Why
According
to
Bollinger
the
goal
of
university
education
is
to
produce
tolerant
and
non-authoritarian
citizens
citizens
who
have
the
imaginative
range
and
the
mental
courage
to
take
in
to
explore
the
full
complexity
of
the
subject
To
set
aside
one's
pre-existing
beliefs
to
hold
simultaneously
in
one's
mind
multiple
angles
of
seeing
things
to
actually
allow
yourself
seemingly
to
believe
another
view
as
you
consider
it
It
strikes
me
that
this
perspective
on
academic
freedom
is
overly
narrow
We
can
all
agree
that
professor
have
responsibilities
They
must
teach
within
the
confines
of
the
subject
they
are
teaching
They
must
respect
students
whose
views
are
different
than
those
of
the
professor
In
many
courses
they
should
be
expected
to
explore
so
far
as
possible
the
full
range
of
the
complexity
of
the
subject
Bollinger
I
believe
is
not
so
naïve
as
to
believe
that
the
full
range
can
really
be
explored
in
every
course
What
he
means
to
counter
is
one-sided
or
partisan
teaching
But
in
requiring
this
of
every
course
Bollinger
goes
too
far
Is
it
wrong
for
a
teacher
in
a
seminar
on
law
and
economics
to
explore
the
subject
without
having
a
unit
on
challenges
to
law
and
economics
For
a
teacher
of
feminist
thought
not
to
have
a
unit
with
readings
from
fundamentalist
patriarchal
thinkers
Suppose
I
teach
a
seminar
on
First
Amendment
Theory
and
decide
to
focus
on
adherents
to
one
or
two
theories
in
depth
because
I
think
exploring
subjects
in
depth
is
better
than
seeing
the
general
map
of
first
amendment
theory
or
because
I
think
these
two
theories
are
best
and
want
to
compare
them
Is
this
professionally
irresponsible
It
seems
to
me
that
Bollinger
goes
wrong
in
two
ways
First
he
underestimates
the
extent
to
which
a
mission
of
the
university
in
many
courses
is
to
explore
truth
wherever
it
may
lead
This
may
lead
to
teaching
that
some
might
call
partisan
So
long
as
the
partisan
teacher
is
fair
to
those
of
different
views
I
believe
the
cause
of
truth
is
advanced
in
a
university
in
which
such
teaching
is
respected
and
defended
The
other
problem
stems
from
an
overly
narrow
conception
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
makeup
of
a
democratic
citizen
Bollinger
has
written
an
excellent
book
in
which
he
highlights
the
role
of
the
first
amendment
in
encouraging
tolerant
citizens
I
for
one
doubt
that
the
most
important
feature
of
the
first
amendment
is
nurturing
character
traits
though
I
think
it
plays
a
role
But
I
believe
that
Columbia
Law
Professor
Vincent
Blasi
presents
a
richer
view
of
the
kind
of
character
that
the
first
amendment
might
be
out
to
cultivate
Blasi
speaks
in
favor
of
the
claim
that
a
culture
that
prizes
and
protects
expressive
liberty
nurtures
in
its
members
certain
character
traits
such
as
inquisitiveness
independence
of
judgment
distrust
of
authority
willingness
to
take
initiative
perseverance
and
the
courage
to
confront
evil
Such
character
traits
are
valuable
so
the
argument
goes
not
for
their
intrinsic
virtue
but
for
their
instrumental
contribution
to
collective
well-being
social
as
well
as
political

Character

I
believe
that
what
Blasi
says
of
a
first
amendment
culture
is
true
of
a
university
culture
and
that
Bollinger
proposal
of
a
fairness
doctrine
for
the
subject
matter
of
every
course
is
unduly
restrictive
We
need
more
than
tolerant
citizens
we
need
engaged
citizens
Conceding
that
Bollinger's
restrictions
are
appropriate
in
many
introductory
courses
a
first
amendment
culture
is
more
likely
to
produce
engaged
students
and
citizens
than
Bollinger's
more
restricted
culture

this

a

that
she

approve
of
abortion

marriage
But
this
familiar
contrast
is
not

It

A
BBC
Rescue
Boat
in
New
Orleans
Stephen
Darwall
September

Yesterday
I
saw
the
most
amazing
BBC
video
coverage
from
New
Orleans
which
spoke
volumes
about
the
character
and
focus
of
even
our
belated
relief
efforts
there
You
can
find
it
at
the
BBC
News
site
Thanks
to
Ciaran
What
you
will
see
is
footage
from
a
small
boat
that
a
BBC
reporter
and
crew
took
into
one
of
the
poor
African-American
neighborhoods
in
New
Orleans
Winding
their
way
past
floating
dead
bodies
they
find
their
way
to
a
house
with
five
children
and
their
dead
mother
whom
they
rescue
It
seems
quite
incredible
to
me
says
the
BBC
reporter
that
we
are
the
only
boat
in
this
neighborhood
And
in
every
neighborhood
we
have
gone
into
there
are
so
many
people
with
so
many
needs
After
taking
the
family
to
an
evacuation
point
they
return
to
the
neighborhoods
and
find
two
middle-aged
African-American
brothers
still
holding
on
in
their
house
because
they
don't
want
to
leave
their
deceased
mother
whose
body
hangs
above
the
water
level
in
a
sling
Presently
the
report
turns
to
the
relief
effort
itself
and
to
the
high
proportion
of
military/police
to
medical
support
When
the
authorities
do
come
to
these
streets
it's
more
often
in
pickup
trucks
with
guns
more
guns
than
medical
workers
Dr
Greg
Anderson
is
interviewed
and
says
There
are
a
lot
more
cops
and
guns
than
doctors

Tell
Us
Again

Tell
us
again
that
government
is
the
problem
that
things
will
be
perfect
if
we
just
shrink
our
governments
down
to
nothing
and
allow
the
wonders
of
private
enterprise
to
solve
all
of
our
problems
As
we
look
in
horror
at
the
grisly
results
of
under-funded
and
ignored
public
works
projects
we
need
to
hear
again
the
song
that
lulled
us
to
sleep
for
decades
telling
us
that
we
will
all
be
better
off
if
we
vilify
and
ridicule
all
government
programs
Surveying
the
terrible
human
cost
of
a
monumental
failure
to
plan
for
an
emergency
that
was
not
only
predictable
but
predicted
we
need
to
hear
again
that
the
invisible
hand
is
the
best
planner
and
that
government
planning
will
inevitably
make
matters
worse
Tell
us
again
that
poverty
does
not
matter
We
loved
hearing
that
people
living
on
welfare
really
had
it
pretty
good
that
they
were
driving
around
in
Cadillacs
that
the
poverty
line
had
been
manipulated
by
liberal
professors
to
inflate
the
amount
of
money
going
to
undeserving
people
who
refused
to
get
a
decent
job
When
we
worried
that
maybe
some
people
really
could
not
live
on
minimum

First
from
a
high-ranking
Kuwaiti
official
When
the
satellite
channels
reported
on
the
scope
of
the
terrifying
destruction
in
America
caused
by
this
wind
I
was
reminded
of
the
words
of
Prophet
Muhammad
The
wind
sends
torment
to
one
group
of
people
and
sends
mercy
to
others
I
do
not
think
and
only
Allah
really
knows
that
this
wind
which
completely
wiped
out
American
cities
in
these
days
is
a
wind
of
mercy
and
blessing
It
is
almost
certain
that
this
is
a
wind
of
torment
and
evil
that
Allah
has
sent
to
this
American
empire
Out
of
my
absolute
belief
in
the
truth
of
the
words
of
the
Prophet
Muhammad
this
wind
is
the
fruit
of
the
planning
of
Allah
as
is
stated
in
the
text
of
the
Hadith
of
the
Prophet
But
I
began
to
ask
myself
Doesn't
this
country
the
U.S
claim
to
aspire
to
establish
justice
freedom
and
equality
amongst
the
people
Isn't
this
country
claiming
that
everything
it
did
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
was
for
truth
and
justice
How
can
it
be
that
these
American
claims
are
untrue
when
we
see
how
good
prevails
in
the
streets
of
Afghanistan
and
how
it
became
an
oasis
of
security
with
America's
entrance
there
How
can
these
American
claims
in
the
matter
of
Iraq
be
untrue
when
we
see
that
Iraq
has
become
the
most
tranquil
and
secure
country
in
the
world
But
how
strange
it
is
that
after
all
the
tremendous
American
achievements
for
the
sake
of
humanity
these
mighty
winds
come
and
evilly
rip
America's
cities
to
shreds
Have
the
storms
have
joined
the
Al-Qaeda
terrorist
organization
How
sad
I
am
for
America
Here
it
is
poor
thing
trying
with
all
its
might
to
lower
oil
prices
which
have
reached
heights
unprecedented
in
all
history
Along
with
America's
phenomenal
efforts
to
lower
the
price
of
oil
in
order
to
salvage
its
declining
economy
and
its
currency
that
is
still
falling
due
to
the
smart
policy
America
is
implementing
in
the
world
comes
this
storm
the
fruit
of
Allah's
planning
so
that
the
price
of
a
barrel
of
oil
will
increase
further
still
By
Allah
this
is
not
schadenfreude
Oh
honored
gentlemen
I
began
to
read
about
these
winds
and
I
was
surprised
to
discover
that
the
American
websites
that
are
translated
into
Arabic
are
talking
about
the
fact
that
that
the
storm
Katrina
is
the
fifth
equatorial
storm
to
strike
Florida
this
year
and
that
a
large
part
of
the
U.S
is
subject
every
year
to
many
storms
that
extract
a
price
of
dead
and
completely
destroy
property
I
said
Allah
be
praised
until
when
will
these
successive
catastrophes
strike
them
But
before
I
went
to
sleep
I
opened
the
Koran
and
began
to
read
in
Surat
Al-R'ad
The
Thunder
chapter
and
stopped
at
these
words
of
Allah
The
disaster
will
keep
striking
the
unbelievers
for
what
they
have
done
or
it
will
strike
areas
close
to
their
territory
until
the
promise
of
Allah
comes
to
pass
for
verily
Allah
will
not
fail
in
His
promise

So
You
Want
to
Live
in
a
Free
Society
5
Common
Property
Common
Carriers
and
the
Case
of
the
Conscientious
Objecting
Pharmacist
Anderson
on
Political
Economy
Elizabeth
Anderson
August

2005
Imagine
that
you
lived
in
a
place
where
you
had
to
ask
someone
else's
permission
to
leave
your
property
Even
if
the
other
person
always
gave
permission
you
wouldn't
be
free
You'd
be
under
conditional
house
arrest
with
the
other
person
your
discretionary
jailor
The
case
wouldn't
be
much
better
if
you
had
a
choice
of
5
people
to
ask
any
one
of
whose
permission
would
let
you
leave
your
property
Then
those
5
would
be
your
joint
jailors
You'd
have
somewhat
wider
opportunities
assuming
their
decisions
were
not
coordinated
But
you'd
still
be
dominated
by
them
To
be
fully
free
it's
not
enough
just
to
have
wide
opportunities
People
must
be
free
from
the
prospect
of
domination--the
power
of
others
to
arbitrarily
put
them
in
a
state
of
subjection
where
they
must
beg
to
get
an
opportunity
critical
to
living
a
free
life
It's
worse
from
the
perspective
of
freedom
to
be
deprived
of
a
critical
opportunity
by
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
another's
will
than
to
lack
it
due
to
natural
causes
or
lack
of
technological
development
It's
worse
to
be
unable
to
cross
an
unnavigable
river
because
others
arbitrarily
forbid
one
from
using
the
bridge
than
because
the
technology
for
building
a
bridge
at
that
point
is
lacking
In
the
first
case
one
lives
in
a
state
of
subjection
to
others
in
the
second
one
is
merely
technologically
poor
The
house
arrest
case
does
not
require
that
the
jailors
be
state
agents
They
could
be
private
property
owners
in
a
property
regime
that
enforces
an
absolute
right
against
tresspass
and
in
which
an
entire
territory
is
completely
privately
appropriated
such
that
some
parcels
of
private
property
are
wholly
surrounded
by
other
parcels
Then
the
owners
of
the
surrounded
parcels
would
all
be
effectively
trapped
by
the
owners
of
the
surrounding
ones
They'd
be
unfree
They'd
be
unfree
even
if
helicopter
travel
were
feasible
and
private
property
owners
didn't
have
airspace
rights
so
one
could
fly
over
their
property
A
property
regime
that
makes
escape
from
one's
property
either
massively
expensive
inconvenient
rarely
scheduled
and
likely
beyond
one's
budget
or
conditional
on
someone's
arbitrary
will
is
nearly
as
bad
from
the
perspective
of
freedom
as
one
that
conditions
it
on
someone's
arbitrary
will
alone
I'm
going
to
argue
that
consideration
of
freedom
in
cases
like
these
yields
1
An
argument
in
favor
of
keeping
certain
parcels
of
land
in
the
commons
2
An
argument
in
favor
of
the
common
carrier
rule
the
common
law
rule
that
operators
of
transportation
communication
and
hotel
services
offer
their
services
to
all
without
discrimination

An
argument
in
favor
of
applying
the
common
carrier
rule
to
pharmacists
and
other
providers
of
medical
care

In
this
series
of
posts
I've
been
developing
a
view
of
the
requirements
of
a
free
society
I've
introduced
two
notions
of
freedom--as
opportunity
and
as
personal
independence
or
non-domination
Last
time
I
argued
that
freedom-as-opportunity
is
needed
to
justify
private
property
and
is
an
indispensable
idea
for
assessing
social
arrangements
from
the
perspective
of
freedom
In
this
post
I'll
argue
that
freedom-as-personal
independence
is
also
a
necessary
part
of
a
free
society
Recall
that
to
be
free
in
this
sense
is
to
be
in
a
state
in
which
one
is
not
subject
to
coercion
by
the
arbitrary
will
of
another
F
A
Hayek
The
Constitution
of
Liberty
p
11
Despite
my
fealty
to
Hayek's
own
formulation
which
in
fact
follows
a
very
long
tradition
some
might
suspect
that
I
have
tried
to
stack
the
deck
with
some
left-wing
radical
notion
of
freedom
that
capitalist
freedom-lovers
can
do
without
Once
again
the
suspicion
is
right
that
this
notion
of
freedom-as-personal-independence
has
some
political
implications
that
laissez-faire
theorists
will
not
like
as
I
plan
to
show
in
later
posts
But
once
again
freedom-lovers
can't
do
without
this
notion
because
it's
necessary
for
the
rule
of
law
without
which
capitalism
cannot
flourish

the

Lately
it
has
become
commonplace
to
argue
that
Max
Weber's
secularization
thesis
has
turned
out
false
Weber
the
early
20th-century
German
sociologist
suggested
that
modern
world
was
becoming
increasingly
secular
The
development
of
science
in
particular
had
disenchanted
the
world
he
said
But
in
2005
it
does
indeed
seem
things
didn't
quite
go
like
that
whether
the
world
ever
got
particularly
secular
it
would
be
hard
to
argue
right
now
that
religions
and
other
kinds
of
spirituality
are
fast
on
their
way
out
That's
why
it's
interesting

also

History
Lessons
In
Philadelphia
James
Oakes
July

2005
What
do
Lynne
Cheney
and
Cecilia
Cannon
have
in
common
I
assume
everybody
knows
who
Lynne
Cheney
is
but
who's
Cecilia
Cannon
She's
an
assistant
superintendent
of
the
Philadelphia
school
system
and
she
was
recently
quoted
in
praise
of
the
newly
imposed
requirement
that
all
high
school
students
in
the
City
of
Brotherly
Love
be
required
to
study
African
and
African
American
history
in
order
to
graduate
So
what
do
Cheney
and
Cannon
have
in
common
other
than
their
shared
interest
in
education
Both
believe
that
the
reason
for
studying
history
is
to
make
students
feel
good
about
themselves
Cheney
hit
the
big
time
about
a
decade
ago
when
she
launched
a
pre-emptive
strike
on
the
National
History
Standards
that
she
herself
had
commissioned
as
head
of
the
NEH
According
to
the
Los
Angeles
Times
Mrs
Cheney
argued
that
the
standards
were
not
positive
enough
about
America's
achievements
and
paid
too
little
attention
to
figures
such
as
Gen
Robert
E
Lee
Paul
Revere
and
Thomas
Edison
At
one
point
in
the
initial
controversy
Cheney
denounced
the
standards
as
politicized
history
There
were
not
enough
references
to
the
Constitution
and
too
many
references
to
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
Not
enough
George
Washington
and
too
much
Harriet
Tubman
All
in
all
Cheney
concluded
We
are
a
better
people
than
the
National
History
Standards
indicate
and
our
children
deserve
to
know
it
This
was
the
height
of
sophistication
beside
Rush
Limbaugh's
denunciation
of
the
standards
History
is
real
simple
You
know
what
history
is
It's
what
happened
I
don't
know
if
Mrs
Cheney
has
put
up
her
two-cents
worth
about
the
new
Philadelphia
requirement
but
it
seems
tailor-made
to
arouse
her
wrath
It
is
based
on
a
spurious
body
of
pseudo-knowledge
known
as
Afrocentrism
wherein
the
great
achievements
of
western
civilization
philosophy
literature
mathematics
and
science
are
said
to
have
had
their
origins
in
Africa
specifically
in
the
ancient
black
civilization
of
Kemet
known
outside
Afrocentric
circles
as
Egypt
Philadelphia's
students
will
learn
among
other
things
that
African
mariners
discovered
America
a
century
before
Christopher
Columbus
They
will
be
taught
that
as
many
as
50
million
Africans
were
shipped
to
the
Americas
during
the
Atlantic
slave
trade
Correct
answer
about
twelve
million
Isn't
that
horrible
enough
And
as
if
to
confirm
Cheney's
worst
nightmare
the
great
achievements
of
Africa
will
be
emphasized
whereas
the
United
States
will
appear
as
the
repository
of
virtually
undiluted
evil
Scholars
more
proficient
than
I
have
taken
their
swords
to
the
idiocies
of
Afrocentrism
See
in
particular
Clarence
Walker's
lively
but
highly
informed
book
We
Can't
Go
Home
Again
An
Argument
Against
Afro-Centrism
I'm
fascinated
by
a
somewhat
different
matter
the
peculiar
convergence
of
Lynne
Cheney
and
the
Philadelphia
School
Reform
Commission
Lynne
Cheney
wants
our
students
to
focus
on
the
great
heroes
and
grand
achievements
of
the
United
States
Our
children
deserve
to
know
about
our
greatness
as
a
people
But
that's
exactly
what
Cecilia
Cannon
wants
for
Philadelphia's
students
We
have
the
opportunity
to
do
something
under
our
watch
that
is
really
going
to
do
right
by
our
students
Cannon
declared
something
that
will
have
black
students
finish
their
courses
saying
to
themselves
We've
come
from
some
pretty
great
places
Before
I
go
any
further
let
me
splash
my
credentials
about
if
only
as
a
defensive
maneuver
My
field
of
research
is
American
slavery
I
teach
comparative
slavery
as
well
as
African
American
history
I''ve
supervised
a
number
of
African
history
Ph.D
dissertations
My
point
is
not
to
impress
everyone
with
my
bona
fides
it
is
only
to
say
that
you
won't
find
me
raising
any
questions
about
the
intellectual
legitimacy
of
either
African
or
African
American
history
I
take
these
subjects
very
seriously
and
that's
in
part
why
I'm
troubled
For
one
thing
it
turns
out
that
my
credentials
such
as
they
are
render
me
uniquely
unfit
to
comment
on
the
Philadelphia
proposal
one
of
whose
primary
goals
is
to
play
down
the
significance
of
slavery
Sandra
Dungee
Glenn
the
school
reform
commission
member
who
fought
most
for
this
proposal
is
quoted
to
this
effect
in
the
New
York
Times
People''s
views
and
understanding
of
who
we
are
focus
on
us
as
descendants
of
slaves
Glenn
said
It
begins
and
ends
there
giving
us
inferior
status
This
is
another
standard
Afrocentric
turn
not
much
on
American
slavery
not
a
word
about
slavery
in
Africa
By
studying
teaching
and
writing
about
slavery
I
turn
out
to
be
part
of
the
problem
Philadelphia
is
trying
to
correct
So
Glenn
too
agrees
with
Lynne
Cheney
excessive
attention
to
subjects
like
slavery
makes
a
bad
impression
For
Cheney
students
end
up
feeling
bad
about
America
for
Glenn
black
students
end
up
feeling
bad
about
themselves
This
is
all
too
negative
James
E
Nevels
Chair
School
Reform
Commission
hopes
that
the
new
requirement
will
reflect
the
richness
and
culture
that
all
Americans
of
every
hue
and
nationality
have
brought
to
our
collective
table
The
new
courses
will
complement
the
existing
American
and
World
history
requirements
Nevels
says
thus
placing
the
entire
district''s
history
curriculum
within
an
inclusive
multicultural
framework
I
don't
know
which
is
worse
Mr
Nevels
simple-minded
notions
about
what
students
are
supposed
to
learn
from
history
courses
or
the
gibberish
that
Philadelphia's
students
will
actually
be
taught
in
courses
which
by
the
way
strike
this
poor
soul
as
the
antithesis
of
multiculturalsim
It
would
have
been
nice
if
the
debate
over
the
Philadelphia
proposal
had
focused
on
its
serious
intellectual
flaws
But
no
The
entire
debate
for
and
against
hinges
on
an
entirely
different
matter
The
proponents
of
the
new
requirement
claim
that
it
will
boost
the
self-esteem
of
African
American
students
while
the
opponents
worry
that
it
will
diminish
the
self
esteem
of
whites
and
ethnic
minorities
I
confess
that
I
find
this
obsession
with
self
esteem
nearly
as
disturbing
as
the
curriculum
itself
Once
history
is
enlisted
as
an
agent
of
psychological
well
being
it
ceases
to
be
a
serious
intellectual
enterprise
History
like
mathematics
or
biology--is
not
supposed
to
make
students
feel
good
or
for
that
matter
feel
bad
about
themselves
But
that
seems
to
be
what
the
Philadelphia
proposal
is
all
about
I
am
not
a
psychologist
I
am
not
qualified
to
say
whether
students
need
to
be
spoon-fed
balderdash
so
they
can
feel
good
about
themselves
My
own
seat-of-the-pants
sense
is
that
self
esteem
has
more
to
do
with
performing
well
in
demanding
courses
whether
those
course
are
in
Trigonometry
or
African
history
Anyway
is
self
esteem
what
we're
aiming
for
Haven't
we
all
read
about
those
studies
of
gang
members
who
have
high
self
esteem
I
was
not
happy
when
Lynne
Cheney
began
hectoring
me
and
my
guild
about
teaching
American
history
in
a
more
upbeat
fashion
And
I'm
not
happy
about
having
the
serious
study
of
African
and
African
American
history
corrupted
for
the
sake
of
anybody's
self-esteem
What
might
have
been
a
perfectly
reasonable
proposal
to
balance
a
curriculum
slanted
towards
European
history
turns
out
to
be
nothing
of
the
sort
Throughout
the
debate
critics
have
been
complaining
about
the
Eurocentric
bias
of
traditional
high
school
history
But
Philadelphia
students
now
take
no
European
history
at
all
and
what
they
are
about
to
get
sounds
more
like
anti-European
history
than
African
history
What
might
have
been
an
innovative
introduction
to
a
serious
field
of
historical
inquiry
turns
out
to
be
a
curious
reversion
to
the
very
same
traditional
approach
that
the
proposal''s
defenders
disdain
Except
that
rather
than
being
taught
boring
facts
about
the
great
achievements
of
great
white
men
and
their
great
civilizations
students
will
be
taught
boring
pseudo
facts
about
the
great
achievements
of
great
black
men
and
great
black
civilizations
In
the
end
what's
the
difference
between
history
as
preached
under
Lynne
Cheney's
American
nationalist
dispensation
and
Molefi
Asante's
black
nationalist
dispensation
Both
demand
the
impressment
of
history
into
the
service
of
ideology
Confusing
history
with
propaganda
both
forsake
history
as
a
critical
discipline
And
both
establish
a
bogus
psychological
standard
for
measuring
the
validity
of
any
particular
historical
inquiry
If
it
makes
students
feel
good
about
their
country
or
about
themselves
it
make
no
difference
it's
doing
the
job
More
than
a
century
ago
good
Christians
worried
that
teaching
Darwinism
would
lead
students
devalue
human
life
and
thereby
diminish
the
glory
of
God
Fortunately
we've
outgrown
such
notions
and
nobody
these
days
would
seriously
propose
corrupting
the
teaching
of
science
by
Oh
never
mind

Who
knew
a
little
paragraph
buried
in
a
bureaucratic
document
could
kick
up
such
a
fuss
Page
down
to

and
you'll
find
this
uncertain
syntax
and
all
Commissioner
Storms
led
a
discussion
on
the
adoption
of
a
policy
that
Hillsborough
County
Government
abstains
from
promoting
and
participating
in
Gay
Pride
recognition
and
events
The
Board
approved
to
adopt
a
policy
that
Hillsborough
County
Government
abstain
from
acknowledging
promoting
and
participating
in
Gay
Pride
recognition
and
events
The
Board
approved
that
the
policy
would
only
be
able
to
be
overturned
by
a
public
hearing
and
supermajority
vote
Renee
Lee
is
responsible
for
drafting
a
Board
policy
for
Board
review
by
July
20th
Why
Because
the
West
Gate
regional
library
put
up
a
display
for
Gay
and
Lesbian
Pride
month
a
poster
with
famous
gays
and
lesbians
and
books
and
pamphlets
from
the
library's
collection
A
few
patrons
complained
and
the
display
came
down
One
pamphlet
offered
teenagers
with
questions
about
their
sexuality
counseling
resources
That
concerned
Commissioner
Storms
and
hey
presto
a
new
sweeping
policy
for
Florida's
Hillsborough
County
which
includes
Tampa
Is
the
policy
unconstitutional
Does
it
violate
the
first
amendment
Centrally
of
course
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
free
speech
protects
private
citizens
from
government
control
The
law
on
whether
it
protects
one
unit
of
government
from
another
is
dicey
but
see
this
Still
I
don't
think
the
commission's
action
violates
the
first
amendment
Neither
does
she
Renee
Lee
the
Hillsborough
County
attorney
said
it
was
legal
If
the
county
doesn't
want
to
spend
money
promoting
gay
rights
they
can
do
that
Lee
said
It's
not
a
constitutional
breach
This
is
not
a
free
speech
issue
And
the
city
of
Tampa's
human
rights
ordinance
click
on
chapter
12
here
bars
discrimination
on
the
ground
of
sexual
orientation
The
county
removed
sexual
orientation
from
its
ordinance
in
1995
The
library
gets
some
of
its
funding
from
the
city
and
a
citizen
has
filed
a
complaint
with
the
city's
Office
of
Human
Rights
But
I
didn't
notice
any
language
in
the
statute
that
really
applies
So
as
far
as
I
can
tell
then
there
are
no
constitutional
or
other
legal
barriers
to
the
county
commission's
action
This
is
a
policy
dispute
no
more
and
no
less
It
belongs
in
the
political
arena
not
in
court
So
the
commission
got
quite
an
earful
from
the
public
Still
they
adopted
the
policy
It's
one
crummy
policy
And
I
even
think
we
ought
to
be
able
to
agree
on
that
whether
we
approve
of
gay
rights
or
not

the

they

Please
no
snickering

tax-and-spend
Democrats
or
I'll

of

riposte
They
want
public
education
for
all
with
no
siphoning
public

off
to

schemes
thank
you
very
much
I
disagree
They

for

higher

with
increased

The

demands
that
