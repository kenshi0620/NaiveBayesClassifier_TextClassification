First
Casualty
It
seems
that
the
Lebanon
War
has
taken
its
first
political
casualty
Adam
informed
Israel
Defense
Forces
Chief
of
Staff
Dan
Halutz
on
Tuesday
that
he
wished
to
retire
as
soon
as
possible
According
to
an
IDF
spokesman
Halutz
accepted
Adam's
request
The
Maariv
daily
reported
Wednesday
that
Adam
decided
to
retire
when
the
last
soldier
returns
from
Lebanon
which
is
expected
next
week.Undoubtedly
Gen
Adam
commanded
incompetently
during
the
war
However
he
was
far
from
the
only
one
or
the
most
important
one
The
main
fault
lies
with
the
political
leadership
specifically
Olmert
and
Peretz
At
this
point
it
looks
like
Peretz
will
be
the
next
one
to
be
pushed
out
in
Olmert's
attempts
to
avoid
responsibility

More
Reassessment
Since
the
end
of
the
Israel-Hizbullah
war
more
and
more
analysts
and
pundits
have
been
reassessing
the
conventional
wisdom
that
Israel
lost
and
Hizbullah
won
Today
Emanuele
Ottolenghi
weighs
in
with
his
opinion
In
essence
his
point
is
that
while
it
may
seem
that
Israel
lost
because
it
did
not
achieve
its
stated
war
aims
freeing
the
2
captured
soldiers
and
destroying
Hizbullah
Hizbullah
did
not
win
either
because
it
did
not
achieve
its
stated
and
unstated
war
aims
Yet
the
myth
that
has
been
created
is
that
by
being
able
to
survive
Hizbullah
achieved
victory
Ottelenghi
tries
to
refute
this
growing
myth
The
myth
about
Hezbollah's
victory
is
therefore
just
that
a
myth
This
means
that
Israel
did
not
lose
Israel
certainly
did
not
win
either
But
one
should
not
dismiss
Israel's
military
achievements
and
their
potential
effectiveness
in
thwarting
at
least
some
of
Hezbollah's
objectives
Hezbollah's
fighting
force
was
drastically
downgraded
With
over
500
fighters
killed
depending
on
estimates
anything
between
10
and
40
percent
of
its
fighting
force
it
will
take
years
for
Hezbollah
to
return
to
where
it
was
Israel
failed
to
destroy
Hezbollah's
Katyusha
arsenal
but
it
dealt
a
crushing
blow
to
its
strategic
arsenal
of
long-range
missiles
Few
noticed
that
at
some
point
in
the
war
Nasrallah
stopped
threatening
to
hit
Tel
Aviv
if
Israel
continued
to
hit
Beirut
mentioning
Haifa
instead
That
is
because
he
could
not
hit
Tel
Aviv
anymore
With
Hezbollah's
arsenal
so
depleted
its
ability
to
seriously
mount
a
new
challenge
is
for
now
correspondingly
damaged
Iran
and
Syria
are
no
doubt
already
rearming
it
But
this
exercise
will
take
time
and
it
will
not
be
ignored
by
the
international
community
as
it
was
in
the
past.Yes
in
many
ways
Israel
did
a
lot
better
than
what
it
is
being
given
credit
for
But
there
was
one
major
factor
in
this
war
that
will
be
critical
going
forward
In
all
its
previous
wars
Israel
fought
knowing
that
the
international
community
will
come
in
and
stop
them
before
they
had
a
chance
to
fully
achieve
victory
The
doctrine
was
therefore
to
achieve
as
many
objectives
as
quickly
as
possible
And
in
every
single
war
it
was
the
Arabs
or
their
Great
Power
patron
the
USSR
who
demanded
a
ceasefire
to
halt
Israel's
advances
In
this
last
war
it
was
Israel
who
wanted
the
ceasefire
It
seemed
that
almost
from
the
beginning
they
were
not
fighting
to
achieve
their
stated
objectives
but
for
a
ceasefire
to
be
imposed
In
a
reversal
of
all
its
previous
wars
Israel
ran
to
the
international
community
to
halt
the
war
In
the
medieval
world
of
the
Middle
East
this
shows
weakness
And
in
showing
weakness
Israel
weakened
its
detterent
capability
vis-a-vis
the
Arab
world
This
is
the
strategic
loss
that
Israel
suffered
in
this
war

Amnesty
International's
Redefinitions
Last
week
Alan
Dershowitz
took
on
Human
Rights
Watch
and
its
looking
the
other
way
at
Hizbullah's
use
of
human
shields
This
week
he
attacks
Amnesty
International's
redefinition
of
war
crimes
and
its
accusations
against
Israel
For
Amnesty
Israeli
war
crimes
are
synonymous
with
any
military
action
whatsoever
The
real
problem
with
Amnesty's
paper
is
that
its
blanket
condemnations
do
not
consider
the
consequences
of
its
arguments
It
doesn't
have
to
it
would
never
advance
these
arguments
against
any
country
but
Israel
Amnesty
International's
conclusions
are
not
based
on
sound
legal
arguments
They're
certainly
not
based
on
compelling
moral
arguments
They're
simply
anti-Israel
arguments
Amnesty
reached
a
predetermined
conclusion
that
Israel
committed
war
crimes
and
it
is
marshalling
whatever
sound-bites
it
could
to
support
that
conclusion

The
Media
and
Israel
Throughout
the
Oslo
War
aka
Second
Intifada
the
mainstream
media
especially
in
Europe
was
overwhelmingly
biased
towards
the
Palestinians
To
say
that
they
were
biased
against
Israel
in
Israel's
war
against
Hizbullah
would
be
an
understatement
In
this
excellent
essay
Melanie
Phillips
details
a
few
of
the
media's
distortions
and
outright
lies
and
comes
up
with
this
conclusion
But
the
big
answer
is
that
the
western
media
transmit
the
lies
of
Hezbollah
because
they
want
to
believe
them
And
that'?s
because
the
Big
Lie
these
media
tell
and
have
themselves
been
told
about
Israel
and
its
place
in
history
and
in
the
world
today
has
achieved
the
status
of
unchallengeable
truth
The
plain
fact
is
that
western
journalists
were
sent
to
cover
the
war
being
waged
against
Israel
from
Lebanon
as
a
war
being
waged
by
Israel
against
Lebanon
And
that'?s
because
that'?s
how
editors
think
of
the
Middle
East
that
the
whole
ghastly
mess
is
driven
by
Israel'?s
actions
and
that
therefore
it
is
only
Israel's
aggression
which
is
the
story
to
be
covered
Thus
history
is
inverted
half
a
century
of
Jewish
victimisation
is
erased
from
public
consciousness
victims
are
turned
into
aggressors
and
genocidal
mass
murderers
turned
into
victims
and
ignorance
and
prejudice
stalk
EnglandÂ?s
once
staunch
and
stalwart
land
That's
why
the
fact
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
refugees
from
the
north
of
Israel
fled
to
the
shelter
of
strangers
in
the
south
that
within
one
third
of
Israel
those
too
poor
or
old
or
handicapped
or
disadvantaged
to
seek
refuge
elsewhere
were
forced
to
live
in
shelters
for
a
month
in
great
hardship
that
the
entire
economy
of
northern
Israel
was
effectively
shut
down
for
a
month
that
thousands
of
rockets
were
fired
at
northern
Israel
hundreds
every
day
many
times
more
than
were
daily
fired
at
Britain
during
the
Blitz
that'?s
why
none
of
this
was
reported
in
Britain
where
as
a
result
such
facts
when
now
related
are
received
with
open-mouthed
astonishment
because
journalists
were
told
to
ignore
it
all
since
that
wasn't
the
story
their
editors
wanted
Israel'?s
victimisation
simply
was
not
could
not
be
the
story
The
only
story
was
Israel's
aggression
But
that
story
is
a
Big
Lie
So
a
host
of
lies
were
transmitted
to
support
it

UNIFIL
Past
and
Future
Throughout
its
existence
UNIFIL
has
been
a
disaster
for
Israel
and
not
much
help
to
the
Lebanese
The
only
group
that
it
has
been
good
for
is
Hizbullah
In
fact
they
have
been
so
good
for
Hizbullah
that
during
this
past
war
UNIFIL
gave
them
critical
intelligence
UNIFIL--the
United
Nations
Interim
Force
in
Lebanon
a
nearly
2,000-man
blue-helmet
contingent
that
has
been
present
on
the
Lebanon-Israel
border
since
1978--is
officially
neutral
Yet
throughout
the
recent
war
it
posted
on
its
website
for
all
to
see
precise
information
about
the
movements
of
Israeli
Defense
Forces
soldiers
and
the
nature
of
their
weaponry
and
materiel
even
specifying
the
placement
of
IDF
safety
structures
within
hours
of
their
construction
New
information
was
sometimes
only
30
minutes
old
when
it
was
posted
and
never
more
than
24
hours
old
Meanwhile
UNIFIL
posted
not
a
single
item
of
specific
intelligence
regarding
Hezbollah
forces
Statements
on
the
order
of
Hezbollah
fired
rockets
in
large
numbers
from
various
locations
and
Hezbollah's
rockets
were
fired
in
significantly
larger
numbers
from
various
locations
are
as
precise
as
its
coverage
of
the
other
side
ever
got.Given
this
past
the
question
is
why
did
Olmert
agree
to
an
expanded
UNIFIL
force
Mario
Loyola
thinks
that
the
UN
and
Europe
have
effectively
tricked
themselves
into
protecting
Israel
with
the
new
UNIFIL
What
is
a
new
and
very
real
possibility
now
is
open
conflict
between
Hezbollah
and
the
U.N
force
UNIFIL
has
in
past
years
been
accused
of
coordinating
with
Hezbollah
which
it
might
have
had
to
do
just
as
a
matter
of
survival
But
the
robust
UNIFIL
operating
with
the
military
freedom
of
action
which
France
appears
to
have
secured
at
the
urgings
of
its
army
will
be
in
a
position
to
impose
facts
upon
Hezbollah
It
will
be
high
profile
and
its
commanders
will
want
to
prove
that
it
is
not
a
joke
as
one
Israeli
ambassador
described
the
current
force
Importantly
it
will
not
have
to
seek
Hezbollah'?s
permission
to
move
around
And
although
U.N
officials
have
made
it
clear
that
the
U.N
force
will
not
actively
seek
to
disarm
Hezbollah
they
will
demand
that
Hezbollah
fighters
found
in
the
open
give
over
their
weapons
and
they
are
prepared
to
use
force
to
exact
obedience
The
enhanced
U.N
force
will
no
doubt
create
many
frustrations
for
Israel
and
we
should
be
prepared
for
the
possibility
of
a
hostile
encounter
between
the
two
at
some
point
But
we
should
also
recognize
one
important
bit
of
good
news
in
all
this
From
now
on
Hezbollah's
activities
will
be
Europe'?s
problem
too
And
however
much
the
Europeans
may
oppose
us
on
Iraq
their
Angry
Muslim
problem
is
starting
to
dominate
both
their
domestic
and
foreign-policy
agendas
and
one
gets
the
feeling
that
they
are
starting
to
get
really
sick
of
it
now.I'm
not
quite
sure
that
it
will
work
out
this
way
given
Europe's
prediliction
against
taking
any
military
action
and
the
large
presence
of
Muslim
forces
among
the
new
UNIFIL
But
UNIFIL
may
provide
enough
of
a
buffer
to
enable
the
Lebanese
to
eventually
do
something
about
Hizbullah
themselves

Human
Rights
Watch
As
Israel
was
battling
Hizbullah
in
Lebanon
and
Hizbullah
rockets
were
raining
down
on
Israeli
cities
Human
Rights
Watch
the
self-proclaimed
arbiter
of
human
rights
violations
was
condemning
Israel
Their
complaint
was
that
Israel
was
committing
war
crimes
by
bombing
civilian
areas
When
it
was
reported
that
Hizbullah
was
using
these
civilian
areas
to
launch
rockets
and
hide
their
weapons
HRW's
response
was
Human
Rights
Watch
found
no
cases
in
which
Hizbullah
deliberately
used
civilians
as
shields
to
protect
them
from
retaliatory
IDF
attack.As
Alan
Dershowitz
points
out
it
is
unclear
what
exactly
Human
Rights
Watch
was
watching
Dershowitz
lists
multiple
eyewitness
reports
from
inside
Lebanon
that
show
exactly
what
Hizbullah
was
doing
HOW
COULD
Human
Rights
Watch
have
ignored
or
more
likely
suppressed
this
evidence
from
so
many
different
sources
The
only
reasonable
explanation
is
that
they
wanted
there
to
be
no
evidence
of
Hizbullah's
tactic
of
hiding
behind
civilians
So
they
cooked
the
books
to
make
it
come
out
that
way
Even
after
the
fighting
ended
and
all
the
reports
of
Hizbullah
hiding
among
civilians
were
published
HRW
chief
Kenneth
Roth
essentially
repeated
the
demonstrably
false
conclusions
that
in
none
of
those
cases
was
Hizbullah
anywhere
around
at
the
time
of
the
attack
So
committed
is
Human
Rights
Watch
to
its
predetermined
conclusions
that
it
refused
to
let
the
facts
as
reported
by
objective
sources
get
in
its
way.HRW
is
the
organization
that
was
screaming
loudest
about
a
massacre
in
Jenin
in
2002
only
to
quietly
say
never
mind
when
it
was
shown
that
no
such
massacre
ever
occurred
I
would
say
that
their
credibility
is
pretty
close
to
zero
at
this
point

Katyusha
Defense
One
of
the
results
of
the
recent
Lebanon
War
has
been
the
restarting
of
the
debate
about
a
defensive
system
for
short
range
rockets
Katyushas
and
mortars
the
primary
weapons
of
Hizbullah
Such
a
system
had
been
in
development
by
the
US
and
Israel
for
approximately
the
last
ten
years
The
System
is
called
Nautilus
Tactical
High
Energy
Laser
THEL
and
the
Mobile
Tactical
High
Energy
Laser
MTHEL
Both
systems
had
shown
themselves
to
be
fairly
effective
being
able
to
track
lock
on
and
shoot
down
Katyushas
both
singly
and
in
salvos
and
even
artillery
shells
Yet
the
funding
for
the
systems
was
withdrawn
by
the
US
Army
and
Israel
last
year
Now
there
is
renewed
interest
in
the
systems
and
Northrop
Grumman
says
that
it
can
deliver
an
operational
system
in
18
months
Given
the
damage
done
by
Hizbullah's
rockets
in
the
past
month
this
seems
like
a
worthwhile
investment

Europe's
Learning
Experience
In
the
last
few
years
Europe
has
come
to
view
the
UN
and
other
international
institutions
as
the
arbiters
and
solvers
of
all
situations
But
as
Denis
Boyles
writes
the
past
few
weeks
may
finally
be
giving
them
some
pause
as
to
the
usefulness
of
these
institutions
The
events
that
seem
to
have
upset
Europe's
assumptions
are
Iran's
response
to
the
nuclear
offer
and
the
cease-fire
Resolution
in
Lebanon
The
main
lesson
with
Iran
is
that
Not
even
Iranians
can
be
persuaded
carrots
make
a
meal
and
confusing
a
U.N
resolution
with
a
stick
offends

event
Bibi
has
positioned
himself
very
well
to
be
the
next
Prime
Minister
And
most
likely
the

Defense

will
be
Moshe

Uzi
Landau
Here
is
an
interesting
interview
with
Uzi
Landau
a
former
Member
of
Knesset
and
a
Minister
in
the
previous
government
Unlike
many
politicians
and
ex-politicians
he
is
not
afraid
to
express
his
views
even
if
they
are
not
sensitive
and
politically
correct

Soviet
Legacy
It
has
been
fairly
well
known
that
one
of
the
Soviet
Union's
activities
was
the
organization
and
financing
of
terrorism
against
Israel
especially
after
the
Six
Day
War
Ion
Mihai
Pacepa
the
former
leader
of
Romania's
intelligence
service
details
the
extent
of
Soviet
involvement
and
its
continuing
effects
Today'?s
international
terrorism
was
conceived
at
the
Lubyanka
the
headquarters
of
the
KGB
in
the
aftermath
of
the
1967
Six-Day
War
in
the
Middle
East
I
witnessed
its
birth
in
my
other
life
as
a
Communist
general
Israel
humiliated
Egypt
and
Syria
whose
bellicose
governments
were
being
run
by
Soviet
razvedka
Russian
for
foreign
intelligence
advisers
whereupon
the
Kremlin
decided
to
arm
Israel'?s
enemy
neighbors
the
Palestinians
and
draw
them
into
a
terrorist
war
against
Israel
General
Aleksandr
Sakharovsky
who
created
Communist
Romania's
intelligence
structure
and
then
rose
to
head
up
all
of
Soviet
Russia's
foreign
intelligence
often
lectured
me
In
today'?s
world
when
nuclear
arms
have
made
military
force
obsolete
terrorism
should
become
our
main
weapon

Nationalism
and
Jihadism
In
the
past
few
weeks
there
have
been
a
number
of
articles
one
is
here
although
registration
is
required
about
the
transformation
of
Palestinian
nationalism
into
just
another
branch
of
the
international
jihad
Today
Amir
Taheri
takes
up
that
argument
The
same
is
now
true
of
pan-Islamists
They
dream
of
a
universal
Islamic
state
either
under
Iranian
Shiite
leadership
as
with
Hezbollah
or
under
the
leadership
of
Salafi
movements
In
their
vision
there
can
be
no
distinct
Palestinian
identity
let
alone
Palestinian
nationalism
Muhammad
Khatami
the
mullah
who
was
president
of
the
Islamic
Republic
has
dismissed
nationalism
as
an
illegitimate
child
of
the
European
Enlightenment
which
led
to
colonialism
imperialism
and
world
wars
In
this
view
the
idea
of
a
nation-state
of
Palestine
is
a
Western
concoction
alien
to
Islam
Even
the
one
state
formula
the
fusion
of
Israel
and
Palestine
is
only
an
intermediate
step
Such
a
state
would
eventually
be
absorbed
into
the
single
universal
Islamic
domain
Undoubtedly
in
the
past
few
years
the
Palestinians
have
drawn
closer
to
Islamism
and
away
from
nationalism
Hizbullah
as
well
as
al
Qaeda
has
infiltrated
at
least
Gaza
if
not
also
the
West
Bank
More
importantly
the
election
of
Hamas
shows
the
route
that
the
Palestinians
want
to
take
religion
as
opposed
to
secular
nationalism
However
Taheri's
conclusions
are
completely
incorrect
Israeli
Premier
Ehud
Olmert
is
wrong
in
putting
Ariel
Sharon's
policy
of
unilateral
withdrawal
from
the
West
Bank
on
hold
For
the
two-state
formula
to
work
it
is
imperative
for
Israel
to
decide
exactly
where
it
wants
its
frontiers
to
be
drawn
Once
it
is
clear
where
Israel
wants
to
be
it
would
be
possible
to
discuss
where
Palestine
could
be
as
a
state.His
solution
ignores
the
facts
on
the
ground
Israel's
two
withdrawals
Lebanon
in
2000
and
Gaza
in
2005
have
not
led
to
peace
In
fact
the
very
opposite
has
happened
Both
groups
saw
weakness
in
the
Israeli
withdrawals
and
the
lessons
that
they
took
away
were
that
through
rocket
attacks
and
bombings
Israel
would
be
forced
to
withdraw
The
same
will
happen
with
a
withdrawal
from
the
West
Bank
Palestinians
have
already
been
smuggling
rockets
into
the
West
Bank
and
preparing
to
use
them
Without
an
Israeli
presence
they
would
undoubtedly
smuggle
in
longer
range
rockets
from
Hizbullah
and
its
sponsors
They
would
then
have
the
capability
to
directly
attack
Tel
Aviv
and
Jerusalem
One
of
the
main
lessons
of
the
Lebanon
war
was
that
withdrawal
doesn't
work
and
the
idea
of
a
Palestinian
state
has
been
postponed
for
another
generation

Reassessments
Already
the
reassessments
of
Israel's
performance
in
the
war
against
Hizbullah
is
starting
Edward
Luttwak
in
today's
Jerusalem
Post
thinks
that
the
results
of
the
war
have
been
misread
In
general
his
analysis
is
that
the
IDF
performed
much
better
than
what
it
is
being
given
credit
for
His
argument
is
in
essence
that
on
the
tactical
level
Israel
won
This
is
undoubtedly
true
the
IDF
destroyed
a
large
portion
of
Hizbullah
assets
and
personnel
while
suffering
fairly
light
casualties
Strategypage
drew
very
similar
conclusions
a
few
days
ago
While
Hizbollah
can
declare
this
a
victory
because
it
fought
Israel
without
being
destroyed
this
is
no
more
a
victory
than
that
of
any
other
Arab
force
that
has
faced
Israeli
troops
and
failed
Arabs
have
been
trying
to
destroy
Israel
for
over
half
a
century
and
Hizbollah
is
the
latest
to
fail
But
Hizbollah
did
more
than
fail
it
scared
most
Moslems
in
the
Middle
East
because
it
demonstrated
the
power
and
violence
of
the
Shia
Arab
minority
Sunni
Arabs
and
most
Arabs
are
Sunnis
are
very
much
afraid
of
Shia
Moslems
mainly
because
most
Iranians
are
Shia
not
Arab
and
intent
on
dominating
the
region
like
Iran
has
done
so
many
times
in
the
past
Hizbollah's
recent
outburst
made
it
clear
that
Iran
which
subsidizes
and
arms
Hizbollah
has
armed
power
that
reaches
the
Mediterranean
This
scares
Sunni
Arabs
because
a
Shia
minority
also
continues
to
rule
Syria
where
most
of
the
people
are
Sunni
The
Shia
majority
in
Iraq
which
have
not
dominated
Iraq
for
over
three
centuries
is
now
back
in
control.I
would
agree
with
both
those
assessments
but
as
I
have
written
previously
Israel
has
suffered
severe
damage
to
its
reputation
of
invinciblity
and
ability
to
cause
total
destruction
to
an
attacking
army
