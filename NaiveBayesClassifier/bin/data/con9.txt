Ill
A
Catholic
priest
on
the
University
of
Illinois
campus
has
been
charged
with
selling
cocaine
from
his
church
office
and
rectory
The
Rev
Christopher
Layden
pleaded
not
guilty
Thursday
to
two
counts
of
delivery
of
less
than
1
gram
of
cocaine
within
1,000
feet
of
a
church
and
one
count
of
possession
with
intent
to
deliver
1
to
15
grams
of
cocaine
near
a
church
The
33-year-old
was
arrested
Wednesday
at
St
John's
Catholic
Newman
Center
after
investigators
found
3
grams
of
cocaine
and
drug
paraphernalia
while
searching
his
home
and
office
Is
that
what
we
are
going
to
say
to
justify
this
one
too
We
never
said
we
were
perfect
blah
blah
blah
If
there
are
guitar-playing
priests
then
we
really
can
say
the
Catholic
hierarchy
is
about
sex
drugs
and
rock-n-roll

audacious

The
shame
of
it
Hansen
said
a
moment
later
is
that
other
athletes
are
not
going
to
realize
how
hard
what
he
did
is
The
world
is
fast
at
swimming
now
The
world
was
not
fast
when
Mark
Spitz
did
his
seven
It's
every
part
of
sport
Hansen
said
of
the
range
that
Phelps
displayed
here
It's
endurance
It's
strength
It's
pressure
he
made
the
pressure
putt
in
the
U.S
Open
he
won
the
Tour
de
France
and
he
knocked
out
the
best
fighter
in
the
world
in
the
16th
round
with
an
uppercut
He
did
absolutely
everything
sport
is
supposed
to
be
and
he
did
it
with
a
smile
on
his
face
and
he's
a
good
kid
His
teammate
Brendan
Hansen
appropriately
deferred
the
attention
to
Phelps
just
moments
after
the
historic
relay
win
Of
course
each
of
his
teammates
had
an
interest
in
this
kind
of
press
for
their
sport
because
they
are
keenly
aware
of
just
how
little
airtime
and
ink
the
sport
gets
in
comparison
to
nearly
all
others
However
it
does
not
really
matter
why
Hansen
said
what
he
said
What
is
important
is
that
this
does
appear
to
be
the
kind
of
feat
he
describes
He
did
not
say
it
in
a
jealous
uncertain
or
bitter
way
He
simply
stated
that
the
kind
of
preparation
that
goes
into
setting
world
records
one
by
one
and
beating
the
best
in
the
world
race
by
race
in
this
way
should
be
included
in
the
conversation
for
the
best
sports
moment
of
all
time
And
indeed
he
did
this
without
saying
the
dramatic
part
of
that
the
best
sports
moment
of
all
time
It
was
also
uplifting
to
see
how
genuinely
excited
each
of
these
other
men
to
include
the
teammates
from
the
two
other
relays
appeared
to
be
to
see
Phelps
realize
his
dreams
In
contrast
with
the
whiny
weightlifter
who
threw
his
medal
only
to
have
it
rescinded
this
too
can
make
Americans
proud
It
simply
felt
good
to
live
vicariously
through
these
men
last
night
And
to
them
I
give
my
sincerest
thanks

Hitchens
Remembers
Russert
VF
Daily
Christopher
Hitchens
Remembers
Tim
Russert
Online
Only
vanityfair.com
On
the
other
hand
and
especially
with
his
own
one-on-two
interview
program
The
Tim
Russert
Show
he
could
be
extremely
generous
and
essentially
get
out
of
your
way
while
eliciting
your
opinions
I
most
particularly
remember
him
doing
this
for
Newsweek's
Jon
Meacham
and
myself
who
had
published
competing
books
on
the
role
of
religion
last
year
Tim
was
much
more
than
a
practicing
Catholic
he
was
a
devout
and
highly
serious
one
who
attended
church
every
day
It
was
very
handsome
of
him
I
thought
to
offer
a
whole
hour
of
more
or
less
free
publicity
to
one
atheist
and
one
Episcopalian
And
he
relished
the
discussion
and
the
disagreements
on
the
set
and
off
it
for
their
own
sake
For
those
that
know
me
well
you
know
that
I
was
eager
to
read
or
hear
Christopher's
take
on
Russert's
death
still
a
strange
phrase
for
such
a
lively
man
I
hadn't
a
doubt
that
Hitchens
loved
Russert
for
many
of
the
same
reasons
that
us
his
viewers
did
I
could
also
be
sure
that
they
knew
one
another
well
and
more
than
likely
appreciated
what
the
other
brought
to
the
collective
American
intellectual
table
It's
funny
even
as
I
write
that
the
thought
of
Russert
as
an
intellectual
is
a
disjointed
one
He
clearly
was
an
intellectual
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
never
fancied
himself
as
such
He
was
much
more
interested
in
his
friends
and
viewers
knowing
about
his
Buffalo
home
Big
Russ
and
his
faith
than
proving
to
all
what
he
knew
Over
the
weekend
MSNBC
both
did
tributes
as
well
as
played
old
interviews
he
did
on
Big
Russ
and
Me
and
Wisdom
of
our
Fathers
In
one
interview
led
by
Brokaw
he
told
a
story
from
Wisdom
about
a
10-year-old
boy
walking
with
his
father
up
to
a
Church
As
they
approach
Tim
recounted
the
father
asked
the
son
the
time
The
son
a
bit
baffled
answered
the
father
and
they
stopped
and
watched
a
procession
of
people
file
into
the
Church
for
a
funeral
mass
Later
they
watched
the
mourners
file
out
of
the
Church
and
the
father
asked
once
again
for
the
time
The
son
obliged
The
father
said
That
person's
life
as
most
was
reduced
to
20
minutes
Russert
went
on
saying
that
there
are
few
lessons
that
so
poignantly
describe
how
important
every
action
can
be
and
how
they
may
have
an
impact
on
that
twenty
minutes
Though
he
was
only
let
in
on
that
tale
in
the
last
few
years
and
even
though
I
never
met
the
man
I
feel
certain
that
he
lived
his
life
as
if
Big
Russ
had
been
the
father
in
front
of
that
Church
Another
certainty...Russert's
was
a
life
that
certainly
cannot
be
summed
up
in
20
minutes

DRUDGE
REPORT
2008
DIES
FROM
A
BIG
HEART
Drudge's
headline
is
perfect
Two
days
before
Father's
Day
for
the
man
who
consistently
reminded
us
of
just
what
an
impact
our
fathers
have
on
us
was
the
saddest
of
ironies
I
bought
three
copies
of
Big
Russ
and
Me
one
for
myself
one
for
my
father
and
one
for
my
grandmother
I
am
not
a
big
reader
not
as
much
as
I
would
like
but
this
was
a
cover-to-cover
read
for
me
I
felt
like
I
was
being
educated
on
how
to
live
a
good
life
to
be
a
good
person
Not
a
religious
Meet
the
Press
viewer
I
still
watched
pretty
often
He
really
was
one
of
the
best
interviewers
on
television
I
think
one
of
the
things
we
all
liked
about
him
was
that
he
was
a
lot
like
all
of
us
He
was
a
normal
guy
who
interviewed
people
in
power
in
terms
we
could
understand
He
was
rightly
proud
of
his
own
ability
to
do
that
and
often
gave
credit
for
that
approach
to
his
father
Big
Russ
In
fact
he
often
gave
credit
for
much
of
his
accomplishment
and
particular
wins
to
Big
Russ
and
others
I
hope
that
his
son
Luke
Big
Russ
and
his
wife
can
take
comfort
in
Tim's
grand
impact
on
the
world
far
beyond
politics
Through
his
books
and
his
appearances
he
made
many
of
us
better

On
McClellan
Past
and
Present
If
you
want
to
read
a
serious
book
about
the
intervention
in
Iraq
try
War
and
Decision
By
Christopher
Hitchens
Slate
Magazine
I
used
to
watch
this
mooncalf
blunder
his
way
through
press
conferences
and
think
Exactly
where
do
we
find
such
men
For
the
job
of
swabbing
out
the
White
House
stables
yes
But
for
any
task
involving
the
weighing
of
words
Hah
Now
it
seems
that
he
realizes
and
with
a
shock
at
that
that
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
spin
or
propaganda
involved
in
his
job
description
Well
give
the
man
a
cigar
Beyond
that
the
book
is
effectively
valueless
to
the
anti-war
camp
since
as
McClellan
says
of
the
president
I
consider
him
a
fundamentally
decent
person
and
I
do
not
believe
he
or
his
White
House
deliberately
or
consciously
sought
to
deceive
the
American
people
And
from
this
very
blog
Putting
a
guy
like
Tony
there
is
what
should've
happened
after
Ari
left
There
was
never
a
good
excuse
for
McClellan
With
access
to
the
whole
country
he
picked
Scott
to
speak
publicly
for
him
An
outsider
would
wonder
if
there
was
no
better
candidates
available
This
shows
much
better
taste

A
Request
Mr
President
While
you
are
making
all
of
these
changes
to
your
cabinet
could
you
do
me
one
favor
Could
you
please
replace
McClellan
Unlike
Ari
Scott
is
boring
Maybe
you
want
him
to
be
so
that
the
presidential
briefing
does
not
so
often
end
up
on
the
11
o'clock
news
but
you
couldn't
have
picked
a
blander
briefer
As
usual
Hitchy
says
it
better
but
also
as
usual
I
agree
In
fact
going
back
to
see
my
words
on
McClellan
I
was
shocked
to
find
my
words
were
not
sharper
and
more
venomous
I
remember
cursing
the
decision
I
suppose
I
was
trying
to
sound
more
diplomatic
or
professional
Not
sure
why
I
simply
never
understood
why
we
would
choose
him
to
follow
Ari
who
I
quite
admired
This
is
however
pay
back
for
such
a
stupid
choice
He
was
never
smart
enough
for
the
job
and
he
is
clearly
not
confident
enough
to
be
loyal
to
those
that
gave
him
the
job
he
never
deserved
in
the
first
place
This
is
not
to
say
that
a
person
should
be
loyal
above
all
if
there
is
something
of
value
to
share
McClellan
however
does
not
really
say
anything
Interestingly
I
saw
someone
trying
to
defend
him
can't
remember
who
by
saying
that
the
publisher
talked
him
into
a
negative
piece
using
the
carrot
of
bigger
sales
That
is
terribly
sad
that
a
man
who
was
the
spokesman
for
the
leader
of
the
free
world
could
be
talked
into
something
so
stupid
and
that
his
defenders
had
no
better
explanation
They
could've
simply
said
Scott
does
not
have
a
mind
of
his
own

Framing
of
the
Wright/Pfleger
Mess
From
a
Chicago
Tribune
editorial
posted
May
30
2008
Obama
said
Pfleger's
words
were
divisive
and
backward-looking
Pfleger
apologized
for
what
he
said
at
Trinity
I
regret
the
words
I
chose
Sunday
he
said
in
a
statement
released
by
his
church
St
Sabina
These
words
are
inconsistent
with
Sen
Obama's
life
and
message
and
I
am
deeply
sorry
if
they
offended
Sen
Clinton
or
anyone
else
who
saw
them
he
said.If
they
offended
They
offended
After
everything
that
happened
with
Rev
Jeremiah
Wright
how
on
earth
does
a
priest
or
any
religious
leader
take
the
pulpit
and
behave
as
Michael
Pfleger
did?Yes
race
is
a
factor
in
this
campaign
Some
voters
will
tell
you
point-blank
that
they
won't
vote
for
Barack
Obama
because
he
is
black
But
what
has
marked
Obama's
campaign
is
his
great
ability
to
inspire
people
to
look
beyond
race
It's
a
shame
that
all
of
Obama's
supporters
haven't
done
the
same
What
I
fail
to
understand
is
how
leaders
of
a
Church
group
or
even
family
could
espouse
such
views
I
have
always
thought
that
you
didn't
go
to
Church
to
hear
what
you
wanted
to
hear
but
rather
be
led
by
a
Church
leader
who
told
you
what
you
needed
to
hear
What
has
been
proven
as
of
late
though
I
already
knew
it
is
the
fact
that
Church
leaders
are
playing
to
a
congregation
This
further
proves
that
they
are
not
leaders
at
all
They
are
panderers
and
much
more
interested
in
dollars
in
the
plate
than
salvation
To
be
a
person
of
any
race
and
continue
in
2008
to
fuel
the
basest
of
racial
discussions
and
maintain
a
belief
of
powerlessness
within
a
class
of
people
who
need
personal
power
the
most
is
a
disgrace
and
an
utter
disservice
To
those
for
whom
these
men
were
putting
on
this
display
I
say
pick
your
leaders
more
wisely
Find
leaders
who
tell
you
how
to
build
yourself
up
not
stay
in
a
bitter
and
defeated
state
of
mind
All
of
us
regardless
of
race
gender
or
any
number
of
other
issues
can
feel
defeated
What
we
learn
is
that
we
often
find
in
others
reflections
of
how
we
view
ourselves
To
cheer
a
man
who
is
preaching
your
inability
to
fuel
your
own
fate
is
to
cheer
your
own
destruction
I
wish
for
you
more
than
that

The
Effect
of
the
Liberationist
Pastors
Race
Presidential
Election
of
2008
Barack
Obama
Hillary
Clinton
Elections
Politics
Democratic
Party
New

Times
Even
as
Dr
Cone
and
others
such
as
the
Rev
William
A
Jones
at
Bethany
Baptist
in
Bedford-Stuyvesant
Brooklyn
crafted
a
theology
of
black
liberation
Catholic
theologians
in
Central
and
South
America
crafted
their
own
liberation
theology
arguing
that
God
placed
the
impoverished
peasants
closest
to
his
heart
Michael
Powell
makes
this
point
twice
If
that
is
so
then
what
we
can
deduce
is
the
Church's
complicity
in
arguing
for
their
congregants
to
stay
in
poverty
If
pastors
suggest
on
hundreds
of
Sundays
that
their
parishioners
are
more
loved
by
their
god
as
a
result
of
their
poverty
there
is
no
impetus
to
remove
themselves
in
the
eyes
of
god
I
understand
that
the
people
in
this
article
and
others
would
fight
that
conclusion
but
it
is
logical
and
quite
sad
What
this
also
does
at
its
most
organic
is
suggests
that
they
could
not
ever
have
confidence
in
themselves
as
they
will
always
be
viewed
as
the
impoverished
down-trodden
This
kind
of
belief
perpetuates
a
long
wrong
What
we
should
know
now
these
many
years
after
King
is
that
anyone
of
any
color
creed
or
nationality
has
a
birthright
to
freedom
and
access
to
self-worth
and
success
Now
what
would
our
nation
look
like
if
that
had
been
the
message
at
the
pulpit
over

Utah

It
is
quite
possible
that
had
Mine
Safety
and
Health

known
the
full
severity
of
the
March
bump
M.S.H.A

of
the

contradicts
Robert
E
Murray
the
chief
executive
of
the
Murray
Energy
Corporation
which
owns
and
operates
the

Mr
Murray
has
adamantly
insisted
that
the
initial
fatalities
were
not

because
the
collapse
was
caused
by
an
earthquake
rather
than
by

Federal

What

that
made

when
Bob

Utah
Mine
Disaster
Was
Preventable
Report
Says
New

Times
Utah
Mine
Disaster
Was
Preventable
Report
Says
New
York
Times
It
is
quite
possible
that
had
Mine
Safety
and
Health
Administration
known
the
full
severity
of
the
March
bump
M.S.H.A
would
not
have
approved
the
subsequent
development
and
retreat
mining
of
the
South
Barrier
the
report
said
This
conclusion
about
the
cause
of
the
disaster
contradicts
Robert
E
Murray
the
chief
executive
of
the
Murray
Energy
Corporation
which
owns
and
operates
the
mine
Mr
Murray
has
adamantly
insisted
that
the
initial
fatalities
were
not
foreseeable
because
the
collapse
was
caused
by
an
earthquake
rather
than
by
mining
operations
Federal
mining
officials
who
have
publicly
expressed
skepticism
that
an
earthquake
caused
the
collapse
are
due
to
release
their
own
investigation
report
in
June
What
we
all
suspected
as
we
watched
that
guy
say
and
do
extraordinarily
strange
things
The
one
thing
that
made
me
question
him
most
was
when
Bob
Murray
questioned
the
geologists
who
were
clear
that
no
earthquake
had
occurred
These
are
the
people
we
immediately
want
to
hear
from
after
the
ground
shakes
If
they
say
no
earthquake
most
of
us
tend

them
When
he
was
so
adamant

to

mistake

had

while
his
people
were
irretrievably
trapped
This

An
Unbelievable
Pitch
for
the
Presidency
DRUDGE
REPORT
2008
HILLARY
WHITE
PEOPLE
SUPPORT
ME
What
I
am
not
quite
sure
how
to
appropriately
respond
to
this
She
certainly
has
to
know
better
but
that
almost
makes
a
statement
like
this
worse
knowing
better
and
saying
it
anyway
Once
again
we
have
the
Clinton's
raising
race
as
a
voting
issue
That
is
in
such
stark
contrast
to
the
dream
and
to
who
Americans
aspire
to
be
Really
it
is
just
offensive
Also
this
makes
it
very
very
clear
that
she
can
no
longer
blame
Bill's
statements
earlier
on
in
the
campaign
on
him
going
off
on
his
own
I
didn't
buy
that
anyway
as
they
are
the
king
and
queen
of
strategy
Not
much
is
ever
said
that
hasn't
been
weighed
heavily
if
not
polled
This
it
is
clearer
now
is
their
strategy
Sick
I
understand
that
in
desperation
people
will
say
and
do
things
that
otherwise
would
be
on
the
top
of
their
list
to
condemn
In
this
situation
however
her
better
pitches
to
the
American
people
have
been
dropped
in
exchange
for
this
base
and
profoundly
disgusting
discourse
She
should
be
discussing
how
she
has
been
able
to
work
with
Senators
of
all
stripes
and
each
party
effectively
In
fact
those
Senators
who
were
probably
more
inclined
to
dislike
her
have
spoken
out
in
her
favor
over
the
last
several
years
No
no
she
doesn't
appeal
to
a
country
desirous
of
togetherness
with
her
ability
for
it
No
she
appeals
to
the
much
less
evolved
among
us
Shame
on
the
first
black
president
and
the
first
black
first
lady
