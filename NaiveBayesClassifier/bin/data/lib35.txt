Presidential
Election
Who'da
thunk
it
59
percent
of
voters
surveyed
said
Ms
Palin
was
not
prepared
for
the
job
up
nine
percentage
points
since
the
beginning
of
the
month
Nearly
a
third
of
voters
polled
said
the
vice-presidential
selection
would
be
a
major
factor
influencing
their
vote
for
president
and
those
voters
broadly
favor
Senator
Barack
Obama
the
Democratic
nominee
And
in
a
possible
indication
that
the
choice
of
Ms
Palin
has
hurt
Mr
McCain's
image
voters
said
they
had
much
more
confidence
in
Mr
Obama
to
pick
qualified
people
for
his
administration
than
they
did
in
Mr
McCain

Capitol
Times
This
is
shaping
up
to
be
the
worst
landslide
for
a
Republican
since
former
Arizona
Senator
Barry
Goldwater
I
realize
the
irony
in
that
said
one
distraught
Arizona
Republican
operative
who
asked
for
anonymity
to
speak
frankly
If
I
were
to
place
a
bet
today
I'd
say
McCain
loses
his
home
state
Q
What's
the
difference
between
John
McCain
in
2008
and
Barry
Goldwater
in
1964
A
Barry
Goldwater
was
a

Drudge
Asleep
at
the
Wheel

Presidential
Election
Media
Earlier
this
week
Eric
Boelhert
at
Media
Matters
examined
the
declining
influence
of
Matt
Drudge
T]here's
no
question
that
Drudge's
Web
traffic
remains
strong
and
continues
to
grow
thanks
to
a
burgeoning
international
audience
But
in
terms
of
setting
the
ground
rules
in
terms
of
setting
the
campaign
agenda
Drudge
has
been
AWOL
since
mid-September
when
the
credit
crisis
erupted
Four
years
ago
Drudge
and
the
right-wing
bloggers
were
at
the
peak
of
their
political
power
Today
they're
pretty
much
watching
the
election
pass
them
by
reduced
to
the
role
of
frustrated
sideline
hecklers
Boelhert
argues
that
it's
the
economic
meltdown
that
has
primarily
contributed
to
Drudge's
reduced
ability
to
control
the
narrative
I]t's
obvious
that
since
Wall
Street's
meltdown
commenced
five
weeks
ago
and
since
America's
economic
crisis
became
a
tsunami
of
a
news
story
that's
not
only
dominated
the
media
landscape
but
also
irrevocably
altered
the
course
of
the
campaign
the
Drudge
Report
has
become
largely
irrelevant
in
terms
of
the
setting
the
news
agenda
for
the
White
House
run
Boelhert
makes
some
good
points
about
how
Drudge's
laundering
of
conservative
talking
points
has
failed
to
move
the
Washington
press
corps
this
cycle
as
it
has
in
the
past
In
part
this
is
because
the
talking
points
themselves
are
vacuous
and
desperate
at
this
point
Consider
for
example
the
headline
Drudge
has
been
blaring
all
day
today
JOE
THE
PLUMBER
SCARED
FOR
AMERICA
IF
OBAMA
PREZ
What
sort
of
reaction
does
Drudge
expect
this
to
elicit
other
than
so
fucking
what
Nobody
cares
what
Joe
the
Plumber
thinks
except
for
Rush
Limbaugh
Fox
News
and
the
junkies
who
shoot
up
in
the
conservative
media
echo
chamber
If
Drudge
has
lost
his
influence
it
is
in
no
small
part
because
he
hasn't
realized
that
the
noise
in
the
conservative
echo
chamber
is
making
him
tone
deaf
to
the
actual
zeitgeist
But
it's
not
just
his
laundering
of
GOP
talking
points
that
is
causing
Drudge
to
lose
influence
in
my
opinion
While
he's
always
been
a
partisan
hack
he's
always
been
a
partisan
hack
with
some
pretty
good
news
instincts
and
who
utilized
those
instincts
to
consistently
beat
others
to
the
story
And
despite
what
some
would
say
that
story
wasn't
always
colored
by
his
politics
From
1996
to
about
2006
he
had
a
knack
for
being
a
good
twenty
minutes
ahead
of
cable
TV
and
other
sources
even
when
the
story
was
as
non-political
as
an
earthquake
But
those
news
instincts
seem
to
be
failing
him
lately
and
he
has
become
laconically
slow
at
a
time
when
the
monopoly
he
once
held
on
breaking
news
has
been
erm
broken
by
the
growth
of
the
blogosphere
and
other
internet
news
sources
Nowadays
everyone
knows
the
value
of
speed
yet
Drudge
himself
is
getting
consistently
beaten
to
the
break
with
even
the
most
obvious
of
stories
For
example
when
Paul
Newman
passed
away
a
few
weeks
ago
the
story
first
appeared
early
in
the
morning
on
the
blogs
where
it
lingered
for
several
hours
before
it
was
confirmed
by
reporters
But
not
only
did
the
blogs
beat
Drudge
to
posting
the
story
so
too
did
CBSNews.com
the
BBC
MSNBC
Huffington
Post
and
Yahoo
News
Even
when
the
headline
was
blaring
across
the
net
it
took
another
full
hour
for
it
to
appear
on
Drudge
Such
slowness
is
unforgivable
for
a
site
that
wants
to
set
the
news
agenda
But
not
only
is
he
slow
at
picking
up
on
news
nowadays
he's
agonizingly
slow
at
letting
it
go
I've
checked
Drudge
perhaps
six
times
today
as
I
do
most
days
And
the
problem
is
not
that
his
Joe
the
Plumber
headline
is
laughably
transparent
and
meaningless
though
it
is
The
problem
is
that
in
six
hours
he
has
neither
added
to
the
story
not
that
there
is
anything
to
add
nor
replaced
it
It
just
sits
there
seeping
in
its
own
irrelevance
So
too
have
the
links
about
the
Jennifer
Hudson
tragedy
remained
equally
static
I've
never
cared
for
Drudge's
politics
but
anyone
interested
in
how
news
travels
across
the
Internet
and
from
there
onto
TV
screens
and
into
newspapers
has
to
recognize
the
contribution
he
made
to
Internet
news
and
to
the
accelerated
news
cycle
That
Drudge
now
seems
to
be
falling
behind
in
the
very
media
landscape
that
he
helped
to
create
that
to
me
is
the
story

Some
hardcore
Republicans
are
losing
their
minds
and
showing
their
true
colors
Palin's
routine
attacks
on
the
media
have
begun
to
spill
into
ugliness
In
Clearwater
arriving
reporters
were
greeted
with
shouts
and
taunts
by
the
crowd
of
about
3,000
Palin
then
went
on
to
blame
Katie
Couric's
questions
for
her
less-than-successful
interview
with
kinda
mainstream
media
At
that
Palin
supporters
turned
on
reporters
in
the
press
area
waving
thunder
sticks
and
shouting
abuse
Others
hurled
obscenities
at
a
camera
crew
One
Palin
supporter
shouted
a
racial
epithet
at
an
African
American
sound
man
for
a
network
and
told
him
Sit
down
boy
Wow
nice
set
of
values
you
all
have
got
there
And
Palin
speaking
to
a
sea
of
Palin
Power
and
Sarahcuda
T-shirts
tried
to
link
Obama
to
the
1960s
Weather
Underground
One
of
his
earliest
supporters
is
a
man
named
Bill
Ayers
she
said
Boooo
said
the
crowd
And
according
to
the
New
York
Times
he
was
a
domestic
terrorist
and
part
of
a
group
that
quote
launched
a
campaign
of
bombings
that
would
target
the
Pentagon
and
our
U.S
Capitol
she
continued
Boooo
the
crowd
repeated
Kill
him
proposed
one
man
in
the
audience
The
level
of
hate
at
these
rallies
and
the
absence
of
any
sense
of
shame
is
unbelievable
Yet
the
McCain
campaign
is
making
the
fundamental
mistake
of
thinking
that
this
country
is
filled
with
small
bitter
people
Such
comments
aren't
of
course
reflective
of
all
Republicans
But
when
you
stir
up
ugliness
don't
be
surprised
when
people
start
thinking
of
you
as
ugly
as
well
