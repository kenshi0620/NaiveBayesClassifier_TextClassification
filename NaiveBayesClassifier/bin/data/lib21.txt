Malkin
Award
Nominee
Just
this
past
week
we
saw
what
Barack
Obama
said
about
judges
He
said
I'm
tired
of
these
judges
who
want
to
follow
what
the
Founding
Fathers
said
and
the
Constitution
I
want
judges
who
have
a
heart
have
an
empathy
for
the
teenage
mom
the
minority
the
gay
the
disabled
We
want
them
to
show
empathy
We
want
them
to
show
compassion

Email
From
The
Base
Every
now
and
again
AOL
puts
one
of
my
posts
up
as
a
link
on
its
home-page
and
I
get
a
bucket
load
of
new
readers
who
are
skewed
toward
people
who
still
use
AOL
And
what
I
read
is
helpful
in
getting
out
of
my
elite
cocoon
Here's
one
of
many
responding
to
my
ten
reasons
for
conservatives
to
vote
Obama
You
failed
to
take
into
account
the
one
glaring
reason
not
only
to
NOT
vote
for
Mr
Obama
but
to
hope
and
pray
desperately
that
the
polls
are
dead
wrong
and
Mr
McCain
pulls
off
the
shocker
of
the
century
Supreme
Court
nominations
Should
Obama
win
and
the
left
get
control
of
the
court
the
Second
Amendment
will
surely
be
overturned
and
I
predict
all
hell
will
break
loose
when
previously
law
abiding
citizens
like
me
are
told
to
give
up
our
guns
Regarding
your
Reason
3
Two
words
President
Palin
I
say
PLEASE
Governor
Palin's
selection
to
the
ticket
was
the
reason
I
was
able
to
vote
the
way
I
did
without
holding
my
nose

Sticking
up

I'm

it's

expiring
in

how
sad
that
those
paid

the

should
all
rush
to
prove
that

Finally
an

Some

is

sort
of

perhaps
to

the

by

Change
And
The
Election
This
it
strikes
me
is
the
most
salient
finding
in
the
NYT
poll
Sixty-four
percent
of
voters
polled
said
that
Mr
Obama
would
bring
about
real
change
if
elected
while
only
39
percent
said
that
Mr
McCain
would
And
despite
Mr
McCain's
increased
efforts
to
distance
himself
from
President
Bush
a
majority
still
said
that
he
would
generally
continue
President
Bush's
policies
This
is
an
election
about
change
The
only
way
McCain
could
have
reversed
this
dynamic
was
attacking
Bush
as
a
disaster
from
Day
One
But
he
couldn't
do
that
with
the
party
he
heads
up
and
his
90
percent
pro-Bush
voting
record
Failing
that
he
could
have
picked
Lieberman
as
his
veep
and
cast
his
ticket
as
a
bi-partisan
experienced
change
agent
But
his
party
could
not
have
tolerated
that
either
No
social
and
cultural
moderate
can
be
a
Republican
presidential
ticket
in
the
era
of
Rove
So
McCain
was
left
with
the
party
that
brung
him
and
we
now
know
what
motivates
that
party
fear
of
the
other
and
religious
fanaticism
Hence
his
appalling
fall
campaign
among
the
most
disgusting
and
hollow
I
can
remember

The
Looming
Flip-Flop
Matt
Cooper
on
Obama's
economic
predicament
My
bet
is
that
he's
going
to
have
to
modify
his
plans
slightly
Whatever
majority
he
garners
should
he
win
it's
not
going
to
be
one
that's
eager
to
hike
taxes
Bill
Clinton
had
almost
60
Senate
Democrats
in
1993
and
barely
got
his
tax
hikes
through
I'm
not
sure
it's
going
to
be
that
much
easier
this
time
even
with
a
bevy
of
Democrats
Of
course
Obama
just
has
to
let
the
Bush
tax
cuts
expire
but
since
he
wants
to
keep
them
in
place
for
lower-income
workers
he
still
has
to
pass
something
Watch
for
the
top
tax
rate
to
go
up
a
tad
but
any
increase
in
capital
gains
taxes
are
a
harder
sell
There's
going
to
be
too
much
market
volatility
and
too
much
organized
interest
against
those
hikes

The
Real
McCain
Francis
Fukuyama
has
observed
this
campaign
McCain's
appeal
was
always
that
he
could
think
for
himself
but
as
the
campaign
has
progressed
he
has
seemed
simply
erratic
and
hotheaded
His
choice
of
Sarah
Palin
as
a
running
mate
was
highly
irresponsible
we
have
suffered
under
the
current
president
who
entered
office
without
much
knowledge
of
the
world
and
was
easily
captured
by
the
wrong
advisers
McCain's
lurching
from
Reaganite
free-marketer
to
populist
tribune
makes
one
wonder
whether
he
has
any
underlying
principles
at
all

The
Palin
Poison
It's
slowly
killing
the
McCain
candidacy
and
like
most
poisons
it
eventually
gets
around
to
the
vital
organs
59
percent
of
voters
surveyed
said
that
Ms
Palin
was
not
prepared
for
the
job
up
9
percentage
points
since
the
beginning
of
the
month
Nearly
a
third
of
voters
polled
said
that
the
vice-presidential
selection
would
be
a
major
factor
influencing
their
vote
for
president
and
those
voters
broadly
favored
Senator
Barack
Obama
The
increase
in
the
number
of
voters
who
said
that
Ms
Palin
was
not
prepared
was
driven
almost
entirely
by
Republicans
and
independents
8
in
10
Democrats
viewed
her
as
unprepared
as
well
as
more
than
6
in
10
independents
and
3
in
10
Republicans
My
italics
If
the
GOP
decides
that
Palin
is
the
future
of
their
party
the
GOP
won't
have
a
future
Simple
really
And
the
same
goes
for
those
who
promoted
her
Getting
rid
of
Kristol
and
all
he
represents
is
a
prerequisite

refused

however
saying
that
they
would
prohibit
anyone

from
working
on
the
project
The
Taliban
is
very

in

Khalidi
no
anti-semite
a
laughable
charge
for
anyone
who
actually
knows
him
he
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
respected
Middle
East
scholars
in
the
field
and
even
derided
as
being
too
moderate
by
many
of
my
classmates
I
encourage
everyone
who
suddenly
feels
empowered
to
belittle
him
to
actually
crack
open
one
of
his
books
Lastly
the
thing
about
being
a
spokesperson
for
the
PLO
is
a
pure
fantasy
He
was
allowed
to
be
an
advisor
at
the
Madrid
talks
specifically
because
he
wasn't
part
of
the
PLO
the
US
and
Israel
refused
to
negotiate
with
them
directly

McCainism
And
McCarthyism
Which
is
worse
A
reader
writes
Let's
clarify
how
McCainism
is
different
than
McCarthyism
McCain
is
tapping
into
people's
racial
fears
And
the
thing
that
hasn't
gotten
much
attention
in
all
of
these
stories
about
Obama
being
an
Arab
and
palling
around
with
terrorists
is
that
his
kind
of
racism
has
real
impact
on
people's
lives
Hate
crimes
against
Arabs
South
Asians
and
anyone
with
brown
skin
are
perpetrated
by
the
same
kind
of
racism
Distrust
of
people
who
look
like
that
affects
employment
neighborly
relationships
and
the
kind
of
hate
innocent
children
have
to
face
at
schools
This
isn't
a
senator
calling
people
to
testify
on
Capitol
Hill
This
is
insidious
in
a
far
more
subtle
and
therefore
far
more
impactful
way

That
Fox
Poll
I
reported
on
its
highly
dubious
methodology
and
misleading
news
story
that
in
no
way
lets
readers
know
what
the
facts
really
are
More
from
Blumenthal
via
Ambinder
If
they
have
been
weighting
by
party
and
they
suddenly
changed
their
weighting
I'd
say
it's
a
pretty
questionable
practice
The
last
four
Fox
surveys
all
varied
slightly
in
terms
of
party
ID
so
I'm
not
sure
that's
what
they've
done
That
said
if
the
other
surveys
this
week
show
no
similar
shift
in
party
then
it's
probably
reasonable
to
discount
this
result
The
weighting
was
dramatically
different
from
the
last
poll
and
yet
their
news
story
compared
the
two
as
if
they
were
identical
samples

Malkin
Award
Nominee
There
was
another
time
in
history
when
people
when
the
bell
tolled
And
the
question
was
whether
or
not
they
were
going
to
hear
it
The
time
was
during
Nazi
Germany
with
Adolf
Hitler
You
see
he
brought
crowds
of
clergy
together
to
assure
them
that
he
was
going
to
look
after
the
church
And
one
of
the
members
bold
and
courageous
Reverend
Niemand
sp
made
his
way
to
the
front
and
inaudible
said
Hitler
we
are
not
concerned
about
the
church
Jesus
Christ
will
take
care
of
the
church
We
are
concerned
about
the
soul
of
Germany
Embarrassed
and
chagrined
his
peers
quickly
shuffled
him
to
the
back
And
as
they
did
Adolf
Hitler
said
The
soul
of
Germany
you
can
leave
that
to
me
And
they
did
and
because
they
did
bombs
did
not
only
fall
upon
the
nation
of
Germany
but
also
upon
the
church
and
their
testimony
to
this
very
day

us
not

Weighing
The
Candidate
And
The
Moment
Conor
Friedersdorf
Let
me
offer
what
is
evidently
a
radical
argument
identifying
the
candidate
that
best
approximates
your
ideological
beliefs
is
not
sufficient
reason
to
cast
a
presidential
vote
on
his
behalf
Yes
a
conservative
is
naturally
going
to
weigh
a
candidate's
adherence
to
conservatism
very
heavily
but
not
as
an
end
in
itself
The
ultimate
goal
is
to
choose
the
candidate
whose
election
most
benefits
the
country
not
the
candidate
whose
beliefs
most
closely
reflect
your
own
I
did
my
best
to
explain
why
Obama
fits
this
moment
in
my
article
last
fall
whatever
your
politics
I
might
add
that
I
regard
this
kind
of
flexibility
this
ability
for
liberals
to
occasionally
see
the
merit
of
a
conservative
in
power
as
many
did
with
Reagan
and
the
ability
for
conservatives
to
occasionally
see
the
merit
of
a
liberal
in
power
as
many
now
do
with
Obama
is
a
sign
of
a
polity's
health
not
lack
of
spine
The
strength
of
a
two-party
system
is
undermined
if
both
are
defined
by
pure
ideology
and
adherence
to
it

Dissent
Of
The
Day
A
reader
writes
John
Moody
did
not
call
McCain
a
race-baiter
nor
is
that
necessarily
his
view
The
only
thing
he
said
was
that
if
the
incident
is
a
hoax
McCain
will
be
linked
to
race-baiting
which
only
means
that
people
will
attribute
the
loathsomeness
of
the
act
to
his
campaign
and
be
put
off
by
it
That
doesn't
necessarily
imply
that
McCain
approves
of
such
tactics
though
of
course
he
probably
does
nor
that
Moody
blames
McCain
what
Moody
seemed
to
be
talking
about
is
people's
perception
But
the
way
you
state
it
is
misleading
and
so
often
these
days
your
responses
to
events
seem
knee-jerk
the
angry
response
of
someone
who's
so
fed
up
that
rather
than
reason
out
each
incident
one
by
one
you
paint
everything
with
one
brush
I
take
my
reader's
point
although
of
course
the
incident
does
not
seem
to
have
affected
the
race
in
any
way
The
only
trouble
with
this
is
that
a
McCain
staffer
pushed
this
story
to
the
local
press
before
the
police
did
That
is
what
two
separate
news
organizations
have
shown
I
should
add
that
I
am
indeed
angry
at
the
McCain
campaign
As
someone
who
thought
I
knew
McCain
I'm
staggered
by
its
toxicity
Forgive
me
for
spluttering
occasionally
at
its
constant
racial
insinuations
and
McCarthyism

It's
worth
recalling
Sarah

record
on

total
transparency
from
her
political
opponents
In
her
run
for
Wasilla
mayor
in
a
move
practically
out
of
Karl
Rove's
playbook
she
dwelled
on
how
Stein's

as
to
demand
a

certificate
as
proof

Why
Was
that
promise
last
week
another
lie
Again
I
challenge
Mark
Salter
personally
He
called
me
crazy
for
asking
questions
about
Sarah
Palin's
alleged
fifth
pregnancy
If
you
think
questions
are
not
worth
asking
or
based
on
nothing
but
partisanship
and
hate
please
read
this
account
of
what
is
in
the
public
records
about
it
and
make
up
your
own
mind
I
think
the
bizarre
circumstantial
evidence
easily
rises
to
the
level
of
material
that
should
be
addressed
as
presumably
could
be
done
definitively
by
the
campaign
McCain
chief
aide
Mark
Salter
said
this
about
me
to
my
colleague
Jeffrey
Goldberg
This
whole
story
about
how
the
baby
isn't
hers
Jesus
Christ
Just
crazy
shit
Those
are
fighting
words
Is
Salter
man
enough
to
back
them
up
Or
is
he
a
coward
If
it's
such
crazy
shit
why
has
the
McCain
campaign
not
released
the
readily
available
documents
that
can
prove
it's
crazy
shit
Here's
what
I
wrote
more
than
two
months
ago
about
the
issue
when
the
questions
first
emerged
There
must
be
plenty
of
medical
records
and
obstetricians
and
medical
eye-witnesses
prepared
to
testify
to
Sarah
Palin's
giving
birth
to
Trig
So
please
give
us
these
answers
and
provide
medical
records
for
Sarah
Palin's
pregnancy
and
put
this
to
rest
Again
that
was
in
August
It
is
not
an
answer
to
call
bloggers
insane
because
they
are
asking
factual
questions
to
which
there
must
be
evidentiary
answers
Yes
as
Ed
Morrissey
notes
Biden
McCain
and
Obama
have
been
bad
on
this
as
well
and
this
blog
has
criticized
them
for
it
especially
Biden
where
I've
been
relentless
given
his
aneurysm
history
But
only
Palin
has
offered
nothing
at
all
And
only
Palin
has
a
core
question
of
basic
credibility
at
stake
Only
Palin
has
used
her
medical
history
her
fifth
child
as
a
campaign
plank
