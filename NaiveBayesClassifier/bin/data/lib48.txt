McCain's
Disgrace
The
McCain
campaign
has
been
throwing
around
so
much
mud
and
smears
in
recent
weeks
that
it's
easy
to
miss
just
how
ugly
and
shameful
their
character
assassination
of
Rashid
Khalidi
is
This
is
an
entirely
respectable
highly
respected
scholar
To
go
further
into
making
a
case
for
him
would
only
be
to
enable
and
indulge
McCain's
sordid
appeal
to
racism
For
McCain
personally
to
compare
Khalidi
to
a
neo-nazi
it's
just
an
offense
McCain
should
never
be
forgiven
for
It's
right
down
in
the
gutter
with
Joe
McCarthy
and
the
worst
of
the
worst
Khalidi
is
in
this
new
McCain
set
piece
for
one
reason
as
a
generic
Arab
to
spur
the
idea
that
Obama
is

terrorists

Muslim

Perspective
There's
definitely
been
some
tightening
over
the
last
few
days
in
the
tracking
polls
As
you
know
each
day
we
come
out
with
the
TPM
Track
Composite
a
computed
average
of
6
of
the
8
available
tracking
polls
Here's
the
graph
going
back
to
October
5th
including
today
click
through
for
a
larger
map
ed.note
You
may
be
asking
the
obvious
question
why
do
you
only
use
six
of
the
eight
We
do
not
include
the
TIPP-IBD
because
it's
on
a
five
days
cycle
rather
than
three
like
the
rest
of
the
polls
And
the
sample
size
is
also
much
smaller
than
the
rest
That
creates
both
an
apples
and
oranges
comparison
problem
matching
them
with
the
other
polls
as
well
as
a
question
of
reliability
We
also
do
not
include
the
GWU/Battleground
poll
because
unlike
the
other
trackers
it
only
comes
out
on
weekdays

Sickness
