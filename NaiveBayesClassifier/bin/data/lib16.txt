America
take
a
good
look
at
yourself
I
haven't
blogged
in
months
I
really
don't
have
the
strength
to
Emotionally
I
am
just
whipped
I
thought
that
I
had
finally
found
a
job
that
would
pay
me
enough
to
survive
and
that
I
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
it
closing
it's
doors
and
moving
to
Mexico
in
a
year
but
like
so
many
factories/production
companies
as
soon
as
it
came
time
to
start
giving
me
some
healthcare
they
fired
me
and
hired
some
other
poor
schmuck
that
they'll
just
fire
when
it
comes
time
to
give
them
benefits
That's
the
America
that
I
know
and
it
leaves
me
so
sad
that
I
just
want
to
sleep
and
I
hope
that
when
I
wake
up
it
won't
be
there
anymore

funding
from

it
also
notes
that
even
though
they
were
not
affected
by
Hurricane
in
six
cases
FEMA
reimbursed
residents
of
Miami
Dade
Florida
for
damage
caused
by
snow
and
ice
I
call
that
corruption
And
in
the
wake
of
Hurricane
Katrina
I
call
it
murder
A
visibly
upset
Kanye
West
blurted
out
that
bush
hates
black
people
on
MSNBC's
concert/fund
raising
show
that
they
did
and
MSNBC
won't
even
report
it
They
might
not
agree
with
what
he
said
but
they
Still
Have
To
Report
It
What
the
hell
is
wrong
with
them
And
Kanye
was
right
george
bush
does
hate
black
people
It's
a
powerful
hatred
It's
the
kind
where
he
doesn't
even
care
if
they
live
or
die
He
hates
poor
people
too
and
if
your
black
and
poor
and
you
live
in
America
you
don't
need
me
to
tell
you
how
much
he
hates
you
For
the
last
five
days
I've
watched
poor
black
people
die
of
starvation
waiting
for
FEMA
and
when
I
flipped
past
fox
news
the
anchor
described
it
as
fun
and
a
lot
like
a
sleep
over
barbara
bush
said
something
along
the
lines
of
since
they
were
poor
and
black
living
in
a
shelter
isn't
so
bad
for
them
A
step-up
if
you
will
My
own
brother
said
that
the
country
is
better
off
now
that
they're
dead
Less
people
to
collect
welfare
to
use
his
words
I
will
never
speak
to
my
brother
again
They
are
predicting
that
Katrina's
death
toll
could
be
five
times
higher
than
that
of
9/11
and
half
of
the
country
is
snickering
about
it
The
media
has
ignored
the
poor
for
so
long
they
don't
even
understand
the
world
they
live
in
anymore
Stories
of
people
hiding
from
helicopters
afraid
of
being
hit
with
a
bill
for
the
rescue
has
left
pundits
stunned
but
I
got
news
for
em
when
my
local
emergency
helicopter
takes
a
person
to
the
hospital
it
costs
that
person
anywhere
from
5
to
10
thousand
dollars
a
ride
in
an
ambulance
costs
about
two
thousand
I'd
wave
em
off

bush

A
Tidal
Wave

he's
so

So
you
tell
me
when
he
says
A

what
is

getting
at
It
sure
sounds
like
a

results
of

Abortion
A
Natural
Part
of
Being
a
Good
Mother
Something
about
stuff
being
natural
is
really
important
to
republicans
Just
ask
gay
people
They'll
tell
you
that
republican
are
Really
Big
on
stuff
being
natural
Like
when
it
comes
to
the
law
But
natural
law
isn't
the
only
thing
republicans
are
big
on
They
like
natural
herbs
medicines
flavored
soda
pop
If
it's
natural
they
like
it
so
why
hasn't
anyone
pointed
out
to
them
that
abortion
is
perfectly
natural
There's
a
cat
in
my
back
yard
It's
starving
Being
a
liberal
I
don't
like
to
see
things
suffer
so
I
feed
it
It
hasn't
been
fixed
and
I
don't
want
any
kittens
but
it
can't
get
pregnant
so
I
have
no
worries
about
it
hanging
around
Why
can't
it
get
pregnant
you
may
be
wondering
Because
it's
starving
Natural
birth
control
Starving
animals
don't
have
babies
Well
I
guess
sometimes
they
do
but
for
the
most
part
no
and
for
good
reason
Making
a
baby
takes
a
lot
of
nourishment
so
if
mom
doesn't
have
any
to
spare
her
reproductive
stuff
shuts
down
A
starving
momma
that
can't
feed
herself
won't
be
able
to
feed
a
bunch
of
babies
Now
will
she
And
what
you
may
wonder
happens
when
a
momma
gets
all
preggers
and
then
there's
a
food
shortage
Why
what's
only
natural
She
aborts
them
If
it's
still
early
in
the
pregnancy
her
body
may
just
absorb
them
Failing
that
momma
will
likely
eat
her
young
For
everyone
who
just
went
eww
this
is
all
perfectly
natural
Momma
knows
that
she
can't
feed
them
and
that
they
will
most
certainly
die
And
why
risk
feeding
one
of
her
natural
predators
when
she
needs
a
meal
herself
It
makes
sense
from
a
natural
standpoint
So
why
do
republicans
think
that
the
cat
in
my
back
yard
should
have
more
family
planning
options
than
I
do
maybe
they're
just
big
supporters

You
Want
Him
You
Got
Him
The
DNC's
silence
on
Roberts
has
a
lot
of
people
wondering
what
they're
up
to
Well
let
me
fill
you
in
it's
called
spite
It's
the
15
year
old
screaming
I
don't
care
it's
the
resentment
of
not
being
able
to
change
one's
circumstances
boiling
over
The
American
people
have
grown
apathetic
and
they
don't
think
what
Washington
does
affects
their
day
to
day
life
They
treat
politics
like
football
and
as
long
as
their
team
is
winning
they're
happy
In
the
long
run
they
don't
care
about
the
details
They
want
lower
taxes
and
then
they
bitch
about
everything
from
potholes
to
troops
not
having
bullet
proof
armor
They
don't
understand
that
if
they
don't
pay
their
taxes
they
can't
have
the
other
stuff
They
don't
understand
that
when
jr
lowered
taxes
for
the
top
1
the
government
still
needed
the
money
so
in
order
to
get
it
they
raised
taxes
on
everything
from
houses
to
cigarettes
They
don't
understand
what
judicial
activision
even
is
They
hear
the
republicans
whine
about
it
and
just
roll
their
eyes
They
don't
really
believe
that
Roe
V
Wade
will
be
overturned
and
even
if
it
is
they
don't
think
they'll
ever
get
pregnant
or
whatever
they
tell
themselves
but
the
right
to
privacy
covers
everything
from
choosing
what
form
of
medical
treatment
you
want
to
using
contraception
Republican
hate
contraception
they
even
refuse
to
fund
clinics
that
teach
birth
control
If
you
don't
have
a
right
to
privacy
then
they
can
pass
laws
that
make
using
a
condom
illegal
and
can
you
imagine
the
congress
determining
the
best
way
to
treat
a
medical
disorder
Making
it
the
law
of
the
land
that
if
you
get
disease
x
then
you
must
use
treatment
y
After
all
a
person
treating
their
cancer
with
prayer
could
be
considered
to
be
attempting
suicide
So
let
em
have
him
Let
them
sit
back
and
watch
as
the
zealots
appeal
every
precedent
set
over
the
last
hundred
years
and
when
the
American
people
ask
the
democrats
why
they
didn't
stop
Roberts
from
getting
onto
the
Supreme
Court
the
dems
can
say
you
wanted
him
and
besides
the
RNC
controlls
the
House
the
Senate
and
the
Presidency
then
they
can
sit
back
coyly
and
ask
what
did
you
expect
us
to
do
about
it

If
you've
been
watching

24
hour

channels
you
probably
don't
know
that
Karl
Rove
was
outed
for
leaking
Valerie
Plame's
name
to
any
one
who
would
listen
The
corporate
sponsored
media
doesn't
like
it
when
they
are
denied
the
rights
given
to
real
journalists
and
have
gotten
all
huffy
over
the
Supreme
Court
ignoring
their
pleas
for
protecting
their
sources
Whaaaa
Cry
me
a
river
Telling
the
world
Valerie
Plame's
name
was
not
journalism
It
was
revenge
and
it
was
treason
And
if
a
democrat
had
done
it
they
would
have
been
executed
for
high
crimes
faster
than
bush
used
to
fry
em
down
in
Texas
but
our
media
works
for
the
same
corporations
that
bush
works
for
And
they
don't
ask
hard
questions
anymore
Valerie
Plame's
job
was
protecting
America
from
a
nuclear
attack
She
doesn't
do
that
anymore
So
did
Karl
Rove's
behavior
increase
the
threat
of
a
nuclear
attack
on
America
And
if
a
nuke
goes
off
in
Time's
Square
will
our
media
connect
the
dots
Will
they
ponder
aloud
about
whether
or
nor
Valerie
Plame
could
have
stopped
it
Of
course
not
They'll
be
too
busy

Fun
with
Polls
from
Zogby
In
a
sign
of
the
continuing
partisan
division
of
the
nation
more
than
two-in-five
42
voters
say
that
if
it
is
found
that
President
Bush
did
not
tell
the
truth
about
his
reasons
for
going
to
war
with
Iraq
Congress
should
hold
him
accountable
through
impeachment
While
half
50
of
respondents
do
not
hold
this
view
supporters
of
impeachment
outweigh
opponents
in
some
parts
of
the
country
CNN
and
MSNBC
have
both
reported
that
that
same
poll
also
shows
that
1
in
4
republicans
support
impeaching
bush
if
he
lied
and
a
lot
of
dems
are
saying
that
it
shows
bush's
losing
ground
with
the
right
blah
blah
blah
But
lets
face
it
No
one
is
ever
going
to
be
able
to
convince
a
republican
that
bush
lied
Was
wrong
Maybe
But
most
republicans
are
too
hardlined
to
ever
believe
that
their
guy
lied
So
it's
a
stupid
poll
and
if
dems
are
smart
they'll
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
say
that
republicans
are
out
of
touch
with
themselves
and
focus
the
media
into
asking
how
much
evidence
would
it
take
to
convince
republicans
that
bush
did
lie
Now
there's
a
question
of
the
day
that
I
would
like
to
see
I'd
also
like
to
see
the
dems
shame
the
75
of
republicans
that
support
bush
even
if
he
did
lie
And
while
they
are
shaming
people
maybe
they
could
take
a
moment
to
ask
CNN
what
the
hell
is
up
with
their
polls
After
bush's
lame
speech
CNN
polled
300ish
people
on
what
they
thought
of
it
50
were
republicans
25
Dems
and
25
consisted
of
people
to
stupid
to
pick
a
party
and
sure
enough
50%ish
said
they
liked
it
And
I
like
to
say
something
cleaver
here
about
CNNs
stupidity/bias
but
I
can't
Our
media
disappoints

Today
War
Criminals
and
Manipulators
from
Democracy
Now
Britain's
Armed
Forces
Minister
Adam
Ingram
has
admitted
that
the
Bush
administration
lied
to
British
officials
about
the
use
of
napalm-type
firebombs
in
Iraq
In
a
private
letter
obtained
by
The
Independent
newspaper
of
London
Ingram
says
the
US
originally
told
him
they
had
not
used
so-called
MK77s
in
Iraq
at
any
time
but
then
writes
I
regret
to
say
that
I
have
since
discovered
that
this
is
not
the
case
and
must
now
correct
the
position
The
MK77
bombs
are
an
evolution
of
the
napalm
used
in
Vietnam
and
Korea
They
carry
kerosene-based
jet
fuel
and
polystyrene
so
that
the
gel
sticks
to
structures
and
to
its
victims
Note
that
the
use
of
Napalm
was
banned
by
the
U.N
in
1980
but
like
with
every
other
great
moral
leap
made
by
the
countries
of
the
U.N
the
U.S
lagged
behind
and
refused
to
sign
the
agreement
If
it
had
george
bush
jr
could
have
found
himself
on
a
plane
ride
to
the
Hague
to
face
a
war
crimes
tribunal
As
it
is
all
we
can
do
is
hope
that
he
takes
trip
to
a
country
with
a
moral
compass
and
then
they
can
put
his
ass
on
a
plane
to
the
Hague
and
also
from
Democracy
Now
a
report
to
the
G8
Summit
used
to
read
Inertia
in
the
climate
system
means
that
further
warming
is
inevitable
Unless
urgent
action
is
taken
there
will
be
a
growing
risk
of
adverse
effects
on
economic
development
human
health
and
the
natural
environment
and
of
irreversible
long-term

to
our

after

bush
tax
cut
fallout
First
off
after
declaring
that
PBS
is
liberal
republicans
cut
it's
funding
The
president
of
PBS
claims
that
the
cuts
will
begin
a
spiral
of
death
for
public
broadcasting
and
then
republicans
cut
funding
to
the
U.N
The
repubs
claim
it
has
somethig
to
do
with
the
Sudan
being
on
the
U.N
Commission
on
Human
Rights
Why
Is
there
something
on
in
the
Sudan
I
haven't
heard
bush
give
any
speeches
about
the
Sudan
The
repubs
claim
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
oil
for
food
scandal
too
You
know
that
scandal
that
george
w
bush
fully
supported
just
add
them
to
the
list
of
150
other
programs
that
the
republicans
have
already
cut
funding
to
In
other
news
The
World
Health
Organization
has
said
acrylamide
may
be
responsible
for
up
to
one-third
of
all
cancers
caused
by
diet
Potato
chips
are
loaded
with
it
and
required
by
law
to
put
warning
labels
on
their
bags
just
like
cigarettes
But
thanks
to
republican
govenor
Arnold
Schwarzenegger
they
haven't
had
to
And
it
turns
out
that
doing
drug
testing
on
foster
children
with
Aids
is
a
bad
thing
And
since
we
don't
want
to
interfer
with
the
free
market
porn
will
soon
be
available
for
the
Playstation
Portable
PsP
And
it
turns
out
that
Terry
Schiavo
was
infact
dead
already
Half
of
her
brain
mostly
the
part
that
controls
higher
functions
like
thought
was
gone
The
tissue
had
died
and
been
absorbed
by
her
body
She
was
blind
She
wasn't
smiling
at
anyone
She
was
not
responsive
So
what
does
the
republican
Govenor
of
Florida
do
when
it
turns
out
that
he
was
wrong
had
interfered
with
a
persons
right
to
choose
their
medical
treatment
and
exploited
a
tragedy
for
his
own
political
gain
Why
he
launches
an
investigation
into
whether
or
not
her
husband
caused
her
injuries
I
think
someone
should
investigate
whether
jeb
bush
is
an
actual
disciple
of
Satan
or
if
he's
just
pretending
to
be
one
and
then
there's
this
george
bush
jr's
former
Chief
Economist
for
the
Department
of
Labor
thinks
that
george
bush
jr
may
have
been
behind

More
than
Words
Life
itself
is
a
frightening
image
for
every
human
being
Being
strong
in
life
it's
not
easy
Overcoming
uncertainties
is
difficult

Never
doubt
that
a
small
group
of
thoughtful
committed
people
can
change
the
world
Indeed
it
is
the
only
thing
that
ever
has
Margaret
Mead
Every
gun
that
is
made
every
warship
launched
every
rocket
fired
signifies
in
the
final
sense
a
theft
from
those
who
hunger
and
are
not
fed
those
who
are
cold
and
are
not
clothed
