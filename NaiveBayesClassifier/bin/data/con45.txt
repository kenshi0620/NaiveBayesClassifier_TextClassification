Maybe
I'm
living
in
my

little
right-wing
bubble
but
I
see
a
substantial
chance
for
McCain
to
win
the
election
I'll
even
go
so
far
as
to
predict
a
McCain
victory
Am
I

Christian
Aid
Worker
Murdered

Afghanistan

My
head
has
been
so
buried
in
political
news
and
analysis
that
I
completely
missed
last
week's
atrocious
murder
of
Gayle
Williams
in
Afghanistan
Taliban
gunmen
killed
a
Christian
aid
worker
in
Kabul
as
she
was
walking
to
work
on
Monday
and
the
militant
group
said
it
targeted
the
woman
because
she
was
spreading
her
religion
The
dual
South
African-British
national
who
worked
with
handicapped
Afghans
was
shot
to
death
by
gunmen
who
drove
by
on
a
motorbike
in
western
Kabul
said
Interior
Ministry
spokesman
Zemeri
Bashary
The
Taliban
claimed
responsibility
This
woman
came
to
Afghanistan
to
teach
Christianity
to
the
people
of
Afghanistan
militant
spokesman
Zabiullah
Mujahid
told
The
Associated
Press
Our
leaders
issued
a
decree
to
kill
this
woman
This
morning
our
people
killed
her
in
Kabul
Pray
for
the
Williams
family
and
for
the
millions
of
lost
people
in
places
like
Afghanistan
Pakistan
and
Iraq
Matthew
9:35-38
Jesus
went
through
all
the
towns
and
villages
teaching
in
their
synagogues
preaching
the
good
news
of
the
kingdom
and
healing
every
disease
and
sickness
When
he
saw
the
crowds
he
had
compassion
on
them
because
they
were
harassed
and
helpless
like
sheep
without
a
shepherd
Then
he
said
to
his
disciples
The
harvest
is
plentiful
but
the
workers
are
few
Ask
the
Lord
of
the
harvest
therefore
to
send
out
workers
into
his
harvest
field

Contrarian
Racists

Does
anyone
else
get
the
impression
that
extremist
racists
are
just
attention-grabbing
contrarians
White
people
are
faced
with
either
a
negro
or
a
total
nutter
who
happens
to
have
a
pale
face
Personally
I'd
prefer
the
negro
National
Socialists
are
not
mindless
haters
Here
I
see
a
white
man
who
is
almost
dead
who
declares
he
wants
to
fight
endless
wars
around
the
globe
to
make
the
world
safe
for
Judeo-capitalist
exploitation
who
supports
the
invasion
of
America
by
illegals
basically
a
continuation
of
the
last
eight
years
of
Emperor
Bush
Then
we
have
a
black
man
who
loves
his
own
kind
belongs
to
a
Black-Nationalist
religion
is
married
to
a
black
women
when
usually
negroes
who
have
made
it
immediately
land
a
white
spouse
as
a
kind
of
prize
that's
the
kind
of
negro
that
I
can
respect
Any
time
that
a
prominent
person
embraces
their
racial
heritage
in
a
positive
manner
it's
good
for
all
racially
minded
folks
Besides
America
cares
nothing
for
the
interests
of
the
white
American
worker
while
having
a
love
affair
with
just
about
every
non-white
on
planet
Earth
It'd
be
poetic
justice
to
have
a
non-white
as
titular
chief
over
this
decaying
modern
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
I
guess
racists
are
more
complex
and
nuanced
than
I
thought
I
take
great
comfort
from
the
fact
that
these
nuts
are
supporting
the
other
guy

Ted
Stevens
Is
An
Embarrassment
By
Michael
Williams

Categories
Law
Justice
Politics

Public
Policy
The
conviction
on
corruption
charges
does
little
more
than
emphasize
what
has
been
apparent
for
many
years
Alaskan
Senator
Ted
Stevens
is
an
embarrassment
to
the
United
States
to
Alaska
and
to
the
Republican
Party
I'd
say
he's
an
embarrassment
to
the
Senate
but
he
probably
fits
right
in
The
verdict
coming
barely
a
week
before
Election
Day
increased
Stevens
difficulty
in
winning
what
already
was
a
difficult
race
against
Democratic
challenger
Mark
Begich
Democrats
hope
to
seize
the
once
reliably
Republican
seat
as
part
of
their
bid
for
a
filibuster-proof
majority
in
the
Senate
Stevens
84
was
convicted
of
all
the
felony
charges
he
faced
of
lying
about
free
home
renovations
and
other
gifts
from
a
wealthy
oil
contractor
Because
this
kind
of
corruption
is
so
often
overlooked
in
our
government
I'm
sure
Stevens
is
shocked
to
be
facing
jail
time
for
these
bribes
Chris
Dodd
should
be
worried
and
I'd
be
pleased
if
this
investigation
is
the
first
of
many

Interviewing
Political
Cartoonists

Note
to
NPR
few
people
are
as
insufferable
as
newspaper
political
cartoonists
A
political
cartoonist's
job
requires
a
smug
know-it-all
attitude
that
makes
others
want
to
punch
them
in
the
face
The
radio
interview
format
is
particularly
unflattering
to
them
I
can
think
of
few
worse
ways
to
be
exposed
to
a
political
cartoon
than
to
have
the
creator
describe
verbally
it
to
you
while
continuously
laughing
at
his

Marginal
Tax
Rates
By

Williams

I'm
on
basically
the
same
boat
as
Greg
Mankiw
though
not
as
far
along
and
his
analysis
of
his
marginal
tax
rates
no
matter
who
wins
the
election
is
sobering
Considering
the
four
main
taxes
that
we
pay
on
money
we
earn
and
then
intend
to
leave
to
our
heirs
If
there
were
no
taxes
so
t1=t2=t3=t4=0
then
1
earned
today
would
yield
my
kids
28
That
is
simply
the
miracle
of
compounding
Under
the
McCain
plan
t1=.35
t2=.25
t3=.15
and
t4=.15
In
this
case
a
dollar
earned
today
yields
my
kids
4.81
That
is
even
under
the
low-tax
McCain
plan
my
incentive
to
work
is
cut
by
83
percent
compared
to
the
situation
without
taxes
Under
the
Obama
plan
t1=.43
t2=.35
t3=.2
and
t4=.45
In
this
case
a
dollar
earned
today
yields
my
kids
1.85
That
is
Obama's
proposed
tax
hikes
reduce
my
incentive
to
work
by
62
percent
compared
to
the
McCain
plan
and
by
93
percent
compared
to
the
no-tax
scenario
In
a
sense
putting
the
various
pieces
of
the
tax
system
together
I
would
be
facing
a
marginal
tax
rate
of
93
percent
Lame
Note
that
the
difference
between
the
no-tax
28
and
the
with-tax
4.81
or
1.85
isn't
completely
turned
over
to
the
government
most
of
the
wealth
is
simply
destroyed
because
the
government
doesn't
invest
it
and
earn
a
return
it
spends
it
on
depreciating
assets
and
redistributes
it
to
people
who
do
likewise
The
government
is
the
great
destroyer
of
wealth
Maybe
I'll
take
the
afternoon
off

If
you're
undecided
about
Barack
Obama
and
even
vaguely
open
to
the
idea
of
not
voting
for
him
you
really
should
check
out
Gateway
Pundit's
front
page
He
has
video
and
audio
of
Obama
advocating
socialism
praising
foreign
and
domestic
terrorists
and
terror
groups
and
bashing
white
people
Not
ancient
history
but
from
the
1990s
and
2000s
You
might
be
surprised
and
what
you
see
