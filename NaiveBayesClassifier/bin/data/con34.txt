Premature
Obamanation
Howard
Dean
Looks
Forward
to
One
Party
Rule
Howard
Dean
is
all
worked
up
I
bet
he's
screaming
again
Democratic
National
Committee
Chairman
Howard
Dean
said
Monday
that
he's
looking
forward
to
one
party
controlling
all
aspects
of
government
despite
GOP
charges
that
it
would
be
a
disastrous
Nov
4
outcome
Republicans
had
a
chance
to
rule
They
failed
miserably
I
think
it's
time
to
give
the
other
party
a
chance
Dean
said
on
MSNBC
Barney
Frank
has
already
revealed
one
of
their
first
targets
In
a
revealing
meeting
with
the
editorial
board
of
the
Southcoast
Mass
Standard-Times
last
week
Rep
Barney
Frank
D-Mass
called
for
a
25
cut
in
military
spending
saying
We
don't
need
all
these
fancy
new
weapons
Judging
from
his
past
comments
Obama
seems
to
agree
He
says
we
should
talk
to
our
enemies
Obama
Frank
and
the
Democratic
caucus
would
have
us
speak
softly
and
carry
no
stick
at
all
The
irony
here
is
that
this
call
to
disarm
is
coming
from
the
party
of
Franklin
Roosevelt
who
called
the
United
States
the
arsenal
of
democracy
Obama
is
a
far
cry
from
Harry
Truman
or
the
Jack
Kennedy
who
said
that
only
when
our
arms
are
sufficient
beyond
doubt
will
we
be
certain
beyond
doubt
they
will
never
be
employed
It's
fancy
new
weapons
that
now
provide
a
rudimentary
amount
of
protection
against
ballistic
missile
attack
both
here
and
abroad
What
olive
branch
does
Obama
suppose
will
protect
against
Iraq's
Shahab
missiles
once
they're
armed
with
nuclear
warheads
In
a
video
presentation
to
the
far-left
group
Caucus
for
Priorities
Obama
revealed
just
where
Frank's
25
cut
might
come
from
I
will
cut
investments
in
unproven
missile
defense
systems
he
said
I
will
not
weaponize
space
I
will
slow
our
development
of
future
combat
systems
I
will
institute
an
independent
defense
priorities
board
to
ensure
that
the
Quadrennial
Review
is
not
used
to
justify
unnecessary
defense
spending
So
forget
about
national
missile
defense
or
responding
to
a
realistic
assessment
of
our
enemies
intentions
and
capabilities
You
folks
in
aerospace
and
defense
should
probably
be
polishing
up
those
resumes
now

Elaine
Lafferty
Sarah
Palin's
a
Brainiac
Elaine
is
a
Democrat
and
former
editor
in
chief
of
Ms
magazine
While
she
does
comment
on
Palin's
intelligence
she
shifts
gears
quickly
and
goes
after
hypocritical
feminists
who've
been
exposed
by
Palin's
selection
Many
of
those
not
all
who
decried
the
sexist
media
treatment
of
Hillary
Clinton
have
been
silent
as
Palin
has
been
skewered
in
the
old
ways
that
female
public
figures
are
skewered
as
well
as
a
host
of
sexualized
new
ways
as
well
Some
feminists
have
weighed
in
Even
the
reportedly
clear
glasses
she
wears
to
play
down
her
beauty
queen
credential
and
enhance
her
gravitas
can't
make
up
for
experience
writes
my
heroine
Suzanne
Braun
Levine
former
editor
of
Ms
Oppose
her
on
policy
Fine
But
how
sad
for
feminist
leaders
to
sink
this
low
especially
when
Palin
has
worn
glasses
since
she
was
10
years
old
Last
month
a
prominent
feminist
blogger
echoing
that
sensibility
declared
that
the
media
was
wrongly
buying
into
the
false
idea
that
Palin
was
a
feminist
Why
Well
just
because
she
said
she
was
a
feminist
because
she
supported
women's
rights
and
opportunities
equal
pay
Title
IV
that
was
just
empty
rhetoric
they
said
At
least
the
blogger
didn't
go
as
far
as
NOW's
Kim
Gandy
and
declare
that
Palin
was
not
a
woman
Bottom
line
you
are
not
a
feminist
until
we
say
you
are
And
there
you
have
the
formula
for
diminishing
what
was
once
a
great
and
important
mass
social
change
movement
to
an
exclusionary
club
that
rejects
women
who
sincerely
want
to
join
and
God
forbid
grow
to
lead

examples
of
this
behavior

Drudge
and
the

liner
More
news
as

Update
knoxnews.com
has
more
The
ATF
says
it
has
broken
up
a
plot
to
assassinate
Democratic
presidential
candidate
Barack
Obama
and
shoot
or
decapitate
102
black
people
in
a
Tennessee
murder
spree
In
court
records
unsealed
Monday
agents
said
they
disrupted
plans
to
rob
a
gun
store
and
target
an
unnamed
but
predominantly
African-American
high
school
by
two
neo-Nazi
skinheads
I
wouldn't
surprised
if
these
guys
turn
out
to
be
a
couple
of
slack-jawed
meth-heads
aren't
all
skinheads
with
little
or
no
chance
of
actually
pulling
this
off
These
stories
are
often
over-hyped
We'll
see
Update
II
The
Smoking
Gun
has
more
In
the
ATF
affidavit
a
copy
of
which
you'll
find
below
Cowart
and
Schlesselman
discussed
the
killing
spree
to
include
targeting
a
predominately
African-American
school
going
state
to
state
while
robbing
individuals
and
continuing
to
kill
people
The
pair's
final
act
of
violence
would
be
an
attempt
to
kill
Obama
the
Democratic
presidential
nominee
In
separate
interviews
with
investigators
the
men
said
that
they
planned
to
speed
their
vehicle
toward
Obama
while
shooting
at
him
from
the
windows
Apparently
befitting
the
historic
assault
Cowart
and
Schlesselman
stated
they
would
dress
in
all
white
tuxedos
and
wear
top
hats
during
the
assassination
attempt
The
wannabe
assassins
were
named
in
a
three-count
federal
felony
complaint
a
copy
of
which
you'll
find
here
Props
to
the
ATF
for
getting
these
fashion-challenged
morons
off
the
street
but
it
doesn't
appear
that
Obama
was
ever
seriously
threatened
by
these
two
They
would
have
been
dead
long
before
their
fantasy
finale
played
out

Barack
Obama
Discusses
His
Strategies
for
Wealth
Redistribution
in
2001
Interview
This
is
a
fantastic
find
but
don't
call
it
an
October
surprise
It
may
be
October
but
the
fact
that
Barack
Obama
is
a
radical
socialist
cloaked
in
meaningless
hope
and
change
marketing
babble
is
not
a
surprise
at
all
That
said
Obama's
dangerous
interpretation
of
our
constitution
and
his
socialist
agenda
should
be
the
only
topics
discussed
by
the
McCain
camp
in
the
closing
days
of
their
campaign
Update
The
McCain-Palin
camp
responds
The
American
people
continue
to
learn
more
about
Barack
Obama
Now
we
know
that
the
slogans
change
you
can
believe
in
and
change
we
need
are
code
words
for
Barack
Obama's
ultimate
goal
redistributive
change
In
a
previously
uncovered
interview
from
September
6
2001
Barack
Obama
expressed
his
regret
that
the
Supreme
Court
hadn't
been
more
radical
and
described
as
a
tragedy
the
Court's
refusal
to
take
up
the
issues
of
redistribution
of
wealth
No
wonder
he
wants
to
appoint
judges
that
legislate
from
the
bench
as
insurance
in
case
a
unified
Democratic
government
under
his
control
fails
to
meet
his
basic
goal
taking
money
away
from
people
who
work
for
it
and
giving
it
to
people
who
Barack
Obama
believes
deserve
it
Europeans
call
it
socialism
Americans
call
it
welfare
and
Barack
Obama
calls
it
change
McCain
senior
policy
adviser
Douglas
Holtz-Eakin

statement
Others
Blogging
HillBuzz
We
are
Democrats
here
are
HillBuzz
telling
you
the
Democrat
in
this
race
scares
us
because
we
know
what
socialism
is
from
spending
time
in
Europe
in
the
80s
and
we
know
it
does
not
work
and
is
not
what
America
needs
Atlas

So
he
doesn't
think
it
can
be
done
through
the
courts
but
he
thinks
it
can
be
done
legislatively
That
is
why
a
Liberal
Supermajority
is
crucial
Wizbang
It
is
surreal
that
this
country
is
close
to
potentially
electing
a
president
who
intends
to
govern
with
such
clear
disregard
to
the
same
Constitution
he
will
be
sworn
to
defend
and
protect
But
imposed
Socialism
won't
be
un-Constitutional
It
will
instead
be
a
heralded
transformation
in
the
name
of
political
and
economic
justice
Right
Pundits
He
does
not
discuss
the
rights
or
wrongs
of
taking
for
each
according
to
their
ability
and
giving
to
each
according
to
their
need
Instead
he
talks
about
the
best
ways
to
go
about
changing
the
system
in
a
way
that
would
best
facilitate
those
changes
He
concludes
that
it
is
best
changed
through
administrative
mandate
because
attempts
to
change
it
through
legislation
is
too
cumbersome
He
also
points
out
that
the
Constitution
is
a
negative
document
telling
us
what
the
States
and
the
Federal
governments
CAN'T
do
Instead
he
says
it
should
address
the
what
the
States
and
Federal
governments
SHOULD
do
In
other
words
he
sees
our
money
as
belonging
to
the
government
He
wants
to
take
our
money
and
he
will
decide
how
to
spend
it
The
democrats
in
Congress
and
the
Senate
are
already
deciding
how
they
will
spend
it
NewsBusters.org
Once
again
we
have
another
story
that
has
been
picked
up
in
a
big
way
by
the
Blogosphere
but
is
currently
being
ignored
by
the
mainstream
media
And
this
time
the
story
is
huge
Protein
Wisdom
In
Obama's
America
we'll
finally
be
able
to
break
free
of
the
constraints
that
were
placed
by
the
founding
fathers
in
the
Constitution
and
in
so
doing
achieve
social
justice
through
redistributive
change
Well
then
Fine
But
this
is
not
the
America
I
knew
Michelle

Joe
The
Plumber
you
barely
scratched
the

Mark

Sometimes
you
just
HAVE
so

After
weeks
of

campaign
denials
after
Joe

got
uppity
with
a
Florida
television
station
over
the
legitimate
question
concerning
Obama's
marxist
beliefs
after
weeks
of
promotion
and
protection
by
the
mainstream
media
after
millions
of
illegal
dollars
made
their
way
into
the
Obama
campaign
coffers
and
after
Hollywood's
disgusting
love
affair
with
Obama
the
truth
comes
out
Obama
is
a
socialist
and
YOU
can
hear
him
say
so
in
his
own
words
Ah
but
it
gets
even
better
Obama

But
since
we

This

note
Obama

No

What

clearly
envisions
is
a
government
program
that
takes
away
your

and
your
incentive
to
work

and
make
it
the

so
that
the

can
go

those
Obama
deems

The
only

Syrian
Television
U.S
Commandos
Stage
Attack
Inside
Syrian
Territory
This
hasn't
been
confirmed
but
it
sounds
like
something
did
go
down
Local
residents
in
a
Syrian
border
town
said
that
American
forces
killed
seven
men
in
a
helicopter-borne
commando
attack
inside
Syrian
territory
Doctors
in
the
town
of
Al-Sukkariya
some
eight
kilometres
from
the
Iraqi
border
said
seven
corpses
and
four
wounded
had
been
delivered
to
a
nearby
clinic
after
the
attack
The
eyewitness
accounts
said
that
four
helicopters
were
involved
in
the
operation
with
two
of
the
helicopters
landing
in
the
town
and
eight
American
soldiers
disembarking
The
eyewitnesses
said
that
the
seven
killed
men
were
supposedly
construction
workers
Afterwards
the
US
helicopters
then
left
Syrian
airspace
with
all
the
soldiers
again
on
board
So
either
the
U.S
military
is
taking
construction
code
enforcement
incredibly
seriously
or
the
Syrian's
are
learning
the
hard
way
that
they
can't
sponsor
or
allow
cross-border
operations
with
impunity
The
area
is
near
the
Iraqi
border
city
of
Qaim
which
had
been
a
major
crossing
point
for
fighters
weapons
and
money
coming
into
Iraq
to
fuel
the
Sunni
insurgency
Iraqi
insurgents
seized
Qaim
in
April
2005
forcing
U.S
Marines
to
recapture
the
town
the
following
month
in
heavy
fighting
The
area
became
secure
only
after
Sunni
tribes
in
Anbar
turned
against
al-Qaida
in
late
2006
and
joined
forces
with
the
Americans
On
Thursday
U.S
Maj
Gen
John
Kelly
said
Iraq's
western
borders
with
Saudi
Arabia
and
Jordan
were
fairly
tight
as
a
result
of
good
policing
by
security
forces
in
those
countries
but
that
Syria
was
a
different
story
The
Syrian
side
is
I
guess
uncontrolled
by
their
side
Kelly
said
We
still
have
a
certain
level
of
foreign
fighter
movement
Update
It
looks
like
we're
confirming
the
attack
and
it
was
related
to
the
hostile
cross-border
traffic
U.S
military
helicopters
launched
an
extremely
rare
attack
Sunday
on
Syrian
territory
close
to
the
border
with
Iraq
killing
eight
people
in
a
strike
the
government
in
Damascus
condemned
as
serious
aggression
A
U.S
military
official
said
the
raid
by
special
forces
targeted
the
foreign
fighter
network
that
travels
through
Syria
into
Iraq
The
Americans
have
been
unable
to
shut
the
network
down
in
the
area
because
Syria
was
out
of
the
military's
reach
We
are
taking
matters
into
our
own
hands
the
official
told
The
Associated
Press
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
of
the
political
sensitivity
of
cross-border
raids
The
attack
came
just
days
after
the
commander
of
U.S
forces
in
western
Iraq
said
American
troops
were
redoubling
efforts
to
secure
the

Barbara
West
and
Joe
Biden
The
Interview
Barack
Obama
Doesn't
Want
You
to
See
Obama-Biden
got
some
tough
but
fair
questions
and
they're
in
total
meltdown
mode
over
it
Biden
so
disliked
West's
line
of
questioning
that
the
Obama
campaign
canceled
a
WFTV
interview
with
Jill
Biden
the
candidate's
wife
This
cancellation
is
non-negotiable
and
further
opportunities
for
your
station
to
interview
with
this
campaign
are
unlikely
at
best
for
the
duration
of
the
remaining
days
until
the
election
wrote
Laura
K
McGinnis
Central
Florida
communications
director
for
the
Obama
campaign
McGinnis
said
the
Biden
cancellation
was
a
result
of
her
husband's
experience
yesterday
during
the
satellite
interview
with
Barbara
West
Voters
need
to
see
this
and
thanks
to
the
Obama-Biden
freakout
they
will

Government
Computers
Used
to
Dig
Up
Information
on
Joe
the
Plumber
It
looks
like
people
may
have
been
illegally
or
at
least
inappropriately
poking
around
in
government
databases
looking
for
information
about
Joe
Wurzelbacher
Public
records
requested
by
The
Dispatch
disclose
that
information
on
Wurzelbacher's
driver's
license
or
his
sport-utility
vehicle
was
pulled
from
the
Ohio
Bureau
of
Motor
Vehicles
database
three
times
shortly
after
the
debate
Information
on
Wurzelbacher
was
accessed
by
accounts
assigned
to
the
office
of
Ohio
Attorney
General
Nancy
H
Rogers
the
Cuyahoga
County
Child
Support
Enforcement
Agency
and
the
Toledo
Police
Department
It
has
not
been
determined
who
checked
on
Wurzelbacher
or
why
Direct
access
to
driver's
license
and
vehicle
registration
information
from
BMV
computers
is
restricted
to
legitimate
law
enforcement
and

business
Paul
Lindsay
Ohio
spokesman
for
the
McCain
campaign
attempted
to
portray
the
inquiries
as
politically
motivated
It's
outrageous
to
see
how
quickly
Barack
Obama's
allies
would
abuse
government
power
in
an
attempt
to
smear
a
private
citizen
who
dared
to
ask
a
legitimate
question
he
said
I
wouldn't
be
surprised
to
see
this
traced
back
to
a
P.I
or
lawyer
with
political
contacts

Pittsburgh
Police
Ashley
Todd
Lied
About
Obama
Supporter
Attack
The
weird
B
and
Twitter
activity
had
a
lot
of
us
suspecting
that
this
would
come
She
didn't
hold
out
long
Pittsburgh
police
said
a
20-year-old
woman
who
originally
said
she
was
robbed
and
assaulted
at
knifepoint
in
Bloomfield
because
of
her
political
views
made
the
story
up
Ashley
Todd
who
has
a
backward
letter
B
scratched
into
her
right
cheek
confessed
to
faking
the
story
and
will
be
charged
with
filing
a
false
report
Assistant
Police
Chief
Maurita
Bryant
said
at
a
news
conference
Friday
Todd
of
College
Station
Texas
admitted
there
was
no
robbery
or
attacker
and
said
she
had
prior
mental
health
problems
according
to
Bryant
We're
looking
at
some
sad
and
stupid
decision
making
by
Ashley
Her
actions
won't
help
her
cause
can't
help
but
fuel
more
racial
tension
and
the
impact
will
be
felt
the
rest
of
her
life
Hopefully
she'll
get
the
help
she
obviously
needs
Update
She's
catching
a
whole
bunch
of
heat
from
liberals
and
conservatives
alike
on
Twitter
