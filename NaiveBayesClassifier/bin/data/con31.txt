Obama's
Iceberg
The
following
is
a
report
found
on
the
website
Illinois
Review
This
is
a
list
of
known
Obama
associations
entitled
Obama's
Iceberg
Aptly
titled
because
Bill
Ayers
is
only
the
tip
Read
through
the
list
and
see
if
there
isn't
a
pattern
that
emerges
You'll
find
that
not
one
of
these
individuals
loves
this
country
supports
its
values
or
reflects
the
majority
viewpoint
Taken
together
these
Obama
associates
present
a
pretty
damning
portrait
of
who
he
is
and
what
he
represents

NObama
Accepting
Untraceable
Contributions
Sen
Barack
Obama's
presidential
campaign
is
allowing
donors
to
use
largely
untraceable
prepaid
credit
cards
that
could
potentially
be
used
to
evade
limits
on
how
much
an
individual
is
legally
allowed
to
give
or
to
mask
a
contributor's
identity
campaign
officials
confirmed
Faced
with
a
huge
influx
of
donations
over
the
Internet
the
campaign
has
also
chosen
not
to
use
basic
security
measures
to
prevent
potentially
illegal
or
anonymous
contributions
from
flowing
into
its
accounts
aides
acknowledged
Instead
the
campaign
is
scrutinizing
its
books
for
improper
donations
after
the
money
has
been
deposited
The
Obama
organization
said
its
extensive
review
has
ensured
that
the
campaign
has
refunded
any
improper
contributions
and
noted
that
Federal
Election
Commission
rules
do
not
require
front-end
screening
of
donations
In
recent
weeks
questionable
contributions
have
created
headaches
for
Obama's
accounting
team
as
it
has
tried
to
explain
why
campaign
finance
filings
have
included
itemized
donations
from
individuals
using
fake
names
such
as
Es
Esh
or
Doodad
Pro
Those
revelations
prompted
conservative
bloggers
to
further
test
Obama's
finance
vetting
by
giving
money
using
the
kind
of
prepaid
cards
that
can
be
bought
at
a
drugstore
and
cannot
be
traced
to
a
donor
The
problem
with
such
cards
campaign
finance
lawyers
said
is
that
they
make
it
impossible
to
tell
whether
foreign
nationals
donors
who
have
exceeded
the
limits
government
contractors
or
others
who
are
barred
from
giving
to
a
federal
campaign
are
making
contributions
They
have
opened
the
floodgates
to
all
this
money
coming
in

Hate-filled
Liberals...Media
Bias
A
Halloween
decoration
showing
a
mannequin
dressed
as
vice
presidential
candidate
Sarah
Palin
hanging
by
a
noose
from
the
roof
of
a
West
Hollywood
home
is
drawing
giggles
from
some
passers-by
and
gasps
of
outrage
from
others
The
mannequin
is
dressed
in
brunet
wig
glasses
and
a
red
business
suit
Another
mannequin
dressed
as
John
McCain
emerges
from
a
flaming
chimney
Chad
Michael
Morisette
who
lives
in
the
house
told
CBS
2
News
that
drivers
and
bus
passengers
have
been
stopping
to
snap
pictures
of
the
macabre
scene
Morisette
says
the
effigy
would
be
out
of
bounds
at
any
other
time
of
year
but
it's
within
the
spirit
of
Halloween
Then
they
won't
mind
my
putting
up
an
effigy
of
Barack
Hussein
Obama
hanging
from
a
noose
This
is
yet
another
in
the
long
line
of
demonstrations
from
the
hate-filled
liberals
in
this
country
of
exactly
how
morally
vacant
they
really
are
The
barking
moonbat
who
made
this
incredibly
disgusting
display
is
lying
through
his
teeth
that
it's
in
the
spirit
of
Halloween
It's
in
the
spirit
alright
the
spirit
of
far-left
extremism
to
send
a
message
of
hate
