it's

Mom
Worsens
by
Dean
Esmay
Unfortunately
the
news
since
yesterday
has
not
improved
She's
on
life
support
and
being
kept
sedated
so
she
doesn't
pull
the
tubes
out
This
is
not
looking
good
I
normally
think
very
well
of
the
hospital
I
took
her
to
and
I
still
think
well
of
some
of
the
staff
but
I'm
getting
upset
by
some
of
them
Their
communication
at
least
from
the
non-nurse
staff
has
been
terrible
I
may
have
to
camp
out
there
if
she
doesn't
get
better
by
tomorrow
Just
thought
I'd
let
you
all
know

Destroy
them
Don't
read
them
buy
them
or
support
them
in
any
way
As
somebody
else
said
Let
them
die
I'll
dance
on
their
graves
by
Dave
Price
Bill
Whittle
via
Glenn
on
the
MSM
I
can't
say
I
disagree
with
the
sentiment
though
again
I
believe
the
rumors
of
their
imminent
demise
are
greatly
exaggerated
The
media
self-selection
problem
is
getting
worse
not
better
social
justice
seekers
are
drawn
to
positions
of
advocacy
the
way
patriots
are
drawn
to
the
military
and
they're
simply
moving
to
more
modern
albeit
less
profitable
mediums
But
in
the
event
there
are
graves
I
will
dance
joyously
upon
them
till
my
feet
bleed
and
I
think
many
others
will
too
The
extent
to
which
the
MSM
have
abdicated
all
fairness
in
this
election
is
unforgivable
and
I
think
many
people
will
never
see
them
in
quite
the
same
light
ever
again

It's
Not
A
Balloon
by

Esmay
This
wicked
cool
story
I
got
from
Instapundit
reminded
me
immediately
of
this
obscure
but
funny
Monty

skit
Who'd
have
thought
you
could
buy
a
ticket
to
fly
on
an
actual
zeppelin
in
2008
Although
I
understand
the
new
ones
are
smaller
than
the
originals
which
were
the
largest
aircraft
ever
built

The
Decision
by
Dave
Price
It's
not
that
complicated
really
If
you
think
we
need
more
free
trade
lower
taxes
less
government
spending
less
government
intervention
and
an
aggressive
foreign
policy
vote
for
McCain
If
you
think
we
need
more
restrictions
on
trade
higher
taxes
more
government
spending
more
government
intervention
and
a
less
aggressive
foreign
policy
then
Obama's
your
guy
What's
somewhat
unfortunate
this
time
around
is
that
much
of
America
has
gotten
caught
up
in
otherwise
laudable
enthusiasm
for
the
first
African-American
President
to
the
exclusion
of
noticing
what
policies
they're
voting
for
and
the
press
which
is
much
more
supportive
of
the
agenda
mentioned
above
than
most
Americans
has
abandoned
any
pretense
of
fairness
Well
it
will
be
an
interesting
four
years
after
the
media
drag
Obama
across
the
finish
line
and
he
starts
actually
governing
UPDATE
Yes
your
taxes
will
go
up
under
Obama
pretty
much
no
matter
who
you
are
Be
sure
to
read
this
whole
article
Obama's
promise
to
cut
taxes
for
95
of
people
is
shall
we
say
highly
nuanced

Mom
In
Hospital
by
Dean
Esmay
It's
been
non-stop
go-go-go
since
getting
Mom
here
which
is
why
I've
been
scarce
around
here
and
why
I
still
owe
a
lot
of
you
folks
individualized
thank
you
notes
for
your
help
Our
recent
adventures
have
been
stress-filled
joy
filled
and
craziness-filled
Unfortunately
just
to
keep
life
interesting
Mom
came
down
with
what
looked
like
a
cold/stomach
virus
on
Friday
and
by
yesterday
had
gotten
so
bad
I
took
her
to
the
hospital
where
she
was
promptly
admitted
for
pneumonia
Your
prayers
and
good
wishes
will
probably
cheer
her
up
though
so
please
feel
free
to
use
the
comments
to
do
that
if
you
wish

Why
is
Obama
Teh
Suck
OMFG
by
Aziz
Poonawalla
As
an
intellectual
excercise
I
am
looking
for
arguments
against
voting
for
Obama
grounded
in
moderate
and
independent
arguments
I
already
know
the
far-left
argument
against
Obama
hes
too
hawkish
OMFG
wants
to
build
up
our
military
OMFG
wont
commit
to
withdrawal
from
Iraq
with
no
loopholes
OMFG
supports
Big
Givernment
bailouts
of
the
financial
sector
OMFG
wrong
on
FISA
OMFG
dared
express
laudatory
thoughts
about
Ronald
Reagan
OMFG
etc
The
conservative
argument
against
Obama
is
likewise
clear
hes
a
socialist
OMFG
he's
got
terrorist
bunkmates
OMFG
he's
surrender
in
Iraq
OMFG
etc
What
I
am
looking
for
instead
of
all
that
is
a
less
frantic
more
restrained
analysis
I
am
not
clear
if
it
exists
but
figured
I'd
tap
the
braintrust
here
one
more
time
given
that
the
response
to
eth
last
post
was
so
OMFG
awesome

Voting
tomorrow
by
Aziz
Poonawalla
I
rarely
abuse
my
front-page
priveleges
in
this
way
but
I
have
to
just
express
my
sincere
appreciation
and
respect
for
Eric
Maniakes
because
of
his
simple
rational
and
principled
call
here
Still
a
reason
to
vote
against
someone
isn't
enough
I
want
a
positive
argument
not
a
negative
one
Thats
why
I
am
pro-Obama
because
Obama
has
articulated
a
reason
for
me
to
vote
FOR
him
more
than
he
has
tried
to
dissuade
me
against
McCain
I
am
voting
tomorrow
I'm
moderately
liberal
and
emphatically
not
Progressive
so
on
issues
like
foreign
policy
taxes
regulation
health
care
or
judicial
appointments
I
am
reasonably
more
in
sync
with
Obama
than
McCain
But
McCain's
central
argument
is
that
he's
not
Bush
v3.0
so
presumably
there
must
be
an
argument
that
his
policies
would
meet
my
preferences
halfway
Can
someone
anyone
articulate
that
argument
A
reason
to
vote
FOR
McCain
rather
than
simply
against
Obama
please
do
not
threadjack
Eric's
post
If
you
want
to
articulate
reasons
against
Obama
then
comment
there
I
want
reasons
FOR
McCain
here
and
not
conservative
ones
but
rather
ones
that
will
appeal
to
the
independent
centrist
moderate
voter

Thousands
Protest
Father-Bashing
Domestic
Violence
Ads
by
Glenn
Sacks
Several
hundred
Dallas
Area
Rapid
Transit
DART
buses
feature
misleading
father-bashing
ads
purporting
to
address
the
serious
issue
of
domestic
violence
One
ad
depicts
a
happy
little
girl
with
the
message
One
day
my
husband
will
kill
me
Another
shows
a
smiling
boy
with
the
message
When
I
grow
up
I
will
beat
my
wife
The
kids
are
talking
about
their
fathers
and
their
pathology
is
due
to
their
fathers
violence
To
depict
only
males
as
perpetrators
of
domestic
violence
and
only
females
as
victims
is
a
severe
distortion
DV
research
clearly
establishes
that
men
account
for
half
of
all
DV
victims
and
incur
a
third
of
DV-related
injuries
as
women
often
employ
the
element
of
surprise
and
weapons
to
compensate
for
men's
strength
The
offending
ads
were
placed
on
the
buses
by
The
Family
Place
a
Dallas
Domestic
Violence
service
provider
Family
Place
Executive
Director
Paige
Flink
told
Fox
News
in
Dallas
that
says
she
designed
the
ads
to
provoke
saying
I
hope
you
are
offended
Flink
assumes
that
domestic
violence
organizations
can
insult
men
with
impunity
As
a
general
rule
she
has
been
correct
the
domestic
violence
establishment
much
of
it
funded
with
your
tax
dollars
has
been
allowed
to
get
away
with
serving
the
public
the
false
woman-as-victim/man-as-monster
domestic
violence
model
DART
Buses
Trains
serve
a
total
of
10
million
commuters
per
month
To
read
the
Associated
Press
and
others
coverage
of
the
ads
click
here
The
message
of
the
DART
ads
is
clear
kids
need
to
be
afraid
of
fathers
Boys
need
to
be
afraid
to
grow
up
to
be
like
dad
and
girls
need
to
fear
marrying
a
man
like
dad
Dads-as-Monsters
ads
such
as
these
influence
our
popular
culture
our
news
media
our
legislators
and
our
family
law
courts
If
you're
a
divorced
dad
who
can
only
see
his
kids
a
few
days
a
month
or
who's
the
victim
of
false
accusations
of
abuse
ads
like
these
are
one
reason
Two
major
billboard
companies
Clear
Channel
Outdoor
and
CBS
Outdoor
have
already
rejected
these
ads
Jodi
Senese
of
CBS
said
the
ads
can
be
both
misleading
and
disturbing
There
are
three
ads
in
this
series
the
two
mentioned
above
and
also
one
apparently
gender-neutral
ad
which
discusses
the
issue
of
domestic
violence
and
teen
suicide
We
have
no
problem
with
the
third
but
we
want
the
first
two
One
day
my
husband
will
kill
me
and
When
I
grow
up
I
will
beat
my
wife
removed
We
abhor
domestic
violence
and
child
abuse
in
all
forms
and
give
credit
to
agencies
like
The
Family
Place
which
help
victims
However
by
failing
or
refusing
to
recognize
male
victims
of
domestic
violence
the
domestic
violence
establishment
and
The
Family
Place
harm
male
victims
and
their
children
Society
once
swept
domestic
violence
under
the
rug
marginalizing
abused
women
and
their
children
As
California's
Third
District
Court
of
Appeal
recognized
in
a
recent
decision
today
male
victims
and
their
children
are
marginalized
These
DART
ads
are
part
of
that
marginalization
Internationally-recognized
domestic
violence
expert
John
Hamel
LCSW
a
court-certified
batterer
treatment
provider
and
author
of
the
book
Gender-Inclusive
Treatment
of
Intimate
Partner
Abuse
explains
Men
account
for
half
of
all
DV
victims
and
incur
a
third
of
DV-related
injuries
Ignoring
female-on-male
violence
inhibits
our
efforts
to
combat
domestic
violence
I
have
joined
with
Fathers
Families
a
national
shared
parenting
organization
in
a
campaign
to
ask
DART
to
remove
these
anti-father
ads

Removing
The
Vice
President's
Executive
Powers
by
Dean
Esmay
Law
professor
Glenn
Reynolds
makes
an
interesting
case
I
find
his
arguments
fairly
persuasive
actually
It's
certainly
true
that
if
you
allow
Vice
Presidents
to
exercise
significant
executive
authority
which
has
been
a
growing
trend
over
the
last
few
decades
actually
then
you
are
in
danger
of
creating
de
facto
coups
Which
is
a
little
startling
when
you
think
about
it
but
it's
true
There
actually
was
such
an
attempt
when
it
became
obvious
that
Richard
Nixon
was
probably
going
to
leave
office
and
there
were
efforts
to
prevent
him
from
appointing
a
new
Vice
President
Those
failed
which
is
how
we
got
Gerald
Ford
but
otherwise
there
would
have
been
what
amounted
to
a
coup
I'd

the

actually
carries

the
system
that
I'd
never
thought
of
before

It's
Rove's
World
by
Dean
Esmay
Karl
Rove
notes
correctly
I
think
that
Democrats
are
in
large
doing
so
well
this
year
because
they're
implementing
the
same
strategies
he
designed
He
says
imitation
is
the
sincerest
form
of
flattery
and
that's
also
by
and
large
correct
the
only
thing
Democrats
should
ever
have
learned
about
Rove
was
that
the
only
thing
wrong
with
his
methods
is
that
they
weren't
using
them
too
Now
they
are
and
to
their
benefit
against
a
Republican
party
that
really
isn't
sure
what
it
stands
for
anymore
Although
the
paranoids
who
obsess
over
Rove
as
an
evil
corrupt
sinister
figure
he
is
none
of
those
things
and
never
have
been
will
undoubtedly
see
this
as
psychological
warfare
of
some
sort
the
smart
political
operatives
know
that
Rove
is
the
smartest
man
in
politics
today
and
that
only
a
fool
would
refuse
to
study
and
learn
from
him

Saying
Dumb
Things
on
the
Campaign
Trail
by
Dean
Esmay
You
know
that's
a
pretty
good
Jack
Murtha
impression
The
Biden
could
use
a
little
work
but
they've
got
his
mannerisms
down
and
boy
Biden
says
dumb
stuff
a
lot
Update
Allahpundit
thinks
this
will
hurt
Congressman
Murtha's
re-election
efforts
I
sure
hope
so
What
a

Why
can't
we
all
just
get
along
by
Eric
Rall
Maniakes
Aren't
there
enough
reasons
to
vote
against
Obama
based
on
his
policy
stances
political
philosophy
and
lack
of
experience
We
could
talk
about
how
he
should
be
more
ashamed
of
certain
of
his
present
and
past
associates
but
I
don't
think
we
should
for
three
reasons
It's
a
distraction
from
more
important
reasons
to
vote
against
him
It
makes
us
sound
petty
and
it
creates
the
impression
that
there
aren't
more
substantive
reasons
to
oppose
him
It
can
be
easily
misinterpreted
as
trying
to
imply
a
much
harsher
complaint
Say
that
Obama
is
friends
with
a
former
terrorist
and
many
people
think
you're
saying
that
Obama
is
a
terrorist
himself
And
that
is
not
a
claim
that
one
should
come
anywhere
near
making
without
solid
evidence
This
goes
double
for
the
unsubstantiated
claim
that
he's
not
a
citizen
and
triple
for
the
absurd
notion
that
Obama
is
some
sort
of
Muslim
extremist
sleeper
agent
The
Ayers
Rezko
and
Wright
complaints
at
least
have
the
virtue
of
having
some
basis
in
fact
So
can
we
talk
about
foreign
policy
taxes
regulation
health
care
or
judicial
appointments
for
a
change

Surprise
Obama
Found
Palling
Around
With
More
Terrorists
by
Dave
Price
And
I
use
surprise
only
in
the
sense
of
unsurprisingly
the
MSM
is
sitting
on
this
story
so
hard
it
makes
their
John
Edwards
love
child
coverage
look
like
the
very
ideal
of
nonpartisan
public-has-a-right-to-know
journalism
Apparently
PLO
spokesman
Rashid
Khalidi
frequently
had
dinner
at
casa
de
Obama
Be
sure
to
watch
for
the
same
massive
media
coverage
we
would
get
if
McCain
was
having
family
dinners
with
a
spokesman
for
a
right-wing
terrorist
group
that
bombed
abortion
clinincs
Meanwhile
Victor
Hanson
imagines
a
world
where
journalists
do
their
job
and
McCain
runs
a
campaign
less
concerned
with
sucking
up
to
his
opponent
Why
didn't
the
media
or
McCain
just
ask
Obama
a
few
of
the
following
questions
Why
did
you
keep
emailing
and
phoning
Bill
Ayers
for
three
years
after
9/11
when
the
country
was
gripped
by
fear
of
terror
and
Ayers
like
bin
Laden
said
that
he
had
not
done
enough
bombing
and
had
no
regrets
about
the
terrorism
he
had
committed
Why
did
Obama
say
in
2004
to
the
Chicago
Sun-Times
that
he
went
to
Trinity
Church
every
Sunday
at
11AM
and
then
later
claim
he
had
not
been
there
that
regularly
once
Rev
Wright's
venom
was
disseminated
to
the
general
public
Is
Obama
for
or
not
for
a
simple
yes
or
no
missile
defense
nuclear
power
off-shore
drilling
and
coal-powered
electrical
generation
There
might
be
legitimate
answers
but
surely
the
public
could
profit
by
them
rather
than
worry
over
the
Palin
pregnancies
wardrobe
or
Tasergate
And
a
journalist
who
does
her
job
finds
her
station
cut
off
by
the
Obama
campaign
He's
not
even
in
office
yet
and
already
the
Fairness
Doctrine
lives
again
Naturally
journalists
everywhere
are
rallying
to
their
defense
just
as
they
did
when
Judith
Miller
was
sent
to
jail
over
the
oh-so-important-to-national-security
question
of
who
let
the
press
know
Joe
Wilson
was
sent
to
Niger
by
his
wife
and
not
by
Cheney
as
he
claimed
turned
out
it
was
Richard
Armitage
so
naturally
Lewis
Libby
was
sent
to
jail
too
