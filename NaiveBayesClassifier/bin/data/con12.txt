Axis
Of
Bias
A
major
newspaper
suppresses
damning
video
of
Barack
Obama
partying
with
pro-terrorism
radicals
Meanwhile
Obama
punishes
news

that

their
jobs
Fairness

anyone
Los
Angeles
Times
owner
Sam
Zell
must
have
thought
of
the
Chicago
Cubs
when
he
OK'd
the
layoff
of
75
editorial
employees
this
week
Zell
owns
the
lovable
loser
Cubs
who
haven't
won
the
World
Series
in
a
century
and
the
liberal
media
are
turning
into
the
Cubs
of
modern
communications
But
news-hungry
consumers
don't
find
it
lovable
when
the
media
elite
keep
important
stories
to
themselves
John
McCain
has
demanded
that
the
L.A
Times
release
its
videotape
of
a
2003
farewell
party
in
Chicago
at
which
Obama
is
said
to
have
grandly
toasted
guest
of
honor
Rashid
Khalidi
the
late
PLO
head
Yasser
Arafat's
spokesman
Ex-terrorist
Bill
Ayers
may
have
been
there
too
But
the
Times
apparently
doesn't
think
Americans
are
entitled
to
see
Obama
praising
a
terrorist
mouthpiece
before
they
decide
whether
to
make
him
president
for
four
years
Similarly
major
news
outlets
buried
this
week's
story
of
Obama
calling
for
major
redistributive
change
in
a
newly
discovered
2001
radio
interview
But
if
you
think
we've
got
an
unholy
alliance
between
liberal
Democrats
in
Washington
and
this
country's
media
elite
now
just
watch
what
happens
if
Obama
becomes
president
with
a
Democratic
Congress
especially
if
it
features
a
filibuster-proof
Senate
Major
Democratic
congressional
leaders
like
Senate
Majority
Whip
Richard
Durbin
of
Illinois
2004
presidential
nominee
Sen
John
Kerry
of
Massachusetts
and
House
Speaker
Nancy
Pelosi
want
the
reinstitution
of
the
outdated
pre-Internet
Fairness
Doctrine
They
want
to
counter
the
news
revolution
in
which
blogs
and
talk
radio
have
taken
on
the
Big
Three
TV
networks
The
Obama
campaign
claims
Obama
opposes
a
new
Fairness
Doctrine
but
City
Journal
editor
Brian
C
Anderson
doesn't
think
a
President
Obama
would
veto
such
a
bill
Moreover
Obama
and
most
Democrats
want
to
impose
more
local
accountability
on
broadcasters
setting
up
community
boards
to
make
their
demands
known
when
station
licenses
come
up
for
renewal
as
Anderson
notes
This
measure
is
clearly
aimed
at
national
syndicators
like
Clear
Channel
that
offer
conservative
shows
Anderson
says
It's
a
Fairness
Doctrine
by
subterfuge
Obama
would
pair
that
with
relicensing
stations
every
two
years
instead
of
the
current
eight
We
have
already
seen
that
Obama's
forces
have
no
scruples
about
punishing
media
organizations
who
do
not
act
as
disciples
of
The
One
Newswomen
with
both
WFTV
in
Orlando

and
the
CBS
affiliate

to
ask
running
mate
Joseph
Biden
about
Obama's
plans
to
spread
the
wealth
as
he
infamously
told
Ohio's
Joe
the
Plumber
The
Obama
campaign
let
the
journalists
know
they
were
now
personae
non
grata
With
both
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
firmly
in
the
power
of
the
most
liberal
leadership
ever
Obama
Pelosi
and
Senate
Majority
Leader
Harry
Reid
it
is
naive
to
think
they
would
not
move
against
those
who
most
threaten
their
prospects
in
the
midterm
elections
of
2010
And
that
is
Fox
News
and
conservative
talk
radio
supported
by
the
blogosphere
The
establishment
media
and
liberal
Democrats
constitute
an
axis
of
bias
arming
to
threaten
the
free
speech
of
Americans

McCain
Owns
the
Kitchen
Table
By
Charles
Krauthammer
Last
week
I
made
the
open-and-shut
case
for
John
McCain
In
a
dangerous
world
entering
an
era
of
uncontrolled
nuclear
proliferation
the
choice
between
the
most
prepared
foreign
policy
candidate
in
memory
vs
a
novice
with
zero
experience
and
the
wobbliest
one-world
instincts
is
not
a
close
call
But
it's
all
about
economics
and
kitchen-table
issues
we
are
told
OK
Start
with
economics
Neither
candidate
has
particularly
deep
economic
knowledge
or
finely
honed
economic
instincts
Neither
has
any
clear
idea
exactly
what
to
do
in
the
current
financial
meltdown
Hell
neither
does
anyone
else
including
the
best
economic
minds
in
the
world
from
Henry
Paulson
to
the
head
of
the
European
Central
Bank
Yet
they
have
muddled
through
with
some
success
Both
McCain
and
Barack
Obama
have
assembled
fine
economic
teams
that
may
differ
on
the
details
of
their
plans
but
have
reasonable
approaches
to
managing
the
crisis
So
forget
the
hype
Neither
candidate
has
an
advantage
on
this
issue
On
other
domestic
issues
McCain
is
just
the
kind
of
moderate
conservative
that
the
Washington/media
establishment
once
loved
the
champion
of
myriad
conservative
heresies
that
made
him
a
burr
in
the
side
of
congressional
Republicans
and
George
W
Bush
But
now
that
he
is
standing
in
the
way
of
an
audacity-of-hope
Democratic
restoration
erstwhile
friends
recoil
from
McCain
on
the
pretense
that
he
has
suddenly
become
right
wing
Self-serving
rubbish
McCain
is
who
he
always
was
Generally
speaking
he
sees
government
as
a
Rooseveltian
counterweight
Teddy
with
a
touch
of
Franklin
to
the
various
malefactors
of
wealth
and
power
He
wants
government
to
tackle
large
looming
liabilities
such
as
Social
Security
and
Medicare
He
wants
to
free
up
health
insurance
by
beginning
to
sever
its
debilitating
connection
to
employment
a
ruinous
accident
of
history
arising
from
World
War
II
wage
and
price
controls
that
increases
the
terror
of
job
loss
inhibits
labor
mobility
and
saddles
American
industry
with
costs
that
are
driving
it
see
Detroit
into
insolvency
And
he
supports
lower
corporate
and
marginal
tax
rates
to
encourage
entrepreneurship
and
job
creation
An
eclectic
moderate
generally
centrist
agenda
in
a
guy
almost
congenitally
given
to
bipartisanship
Obama
on
the
other
hand
talks
less
and
less
about
bipartisanship
his
calling
card
during
his
earlier
messianic
stage
He
does
not
need
to
If
he
wins
he
will
have
large
Democratic
majorities
in
both
houses
And
unlike
1992
Obama
is
no
Clinton
centrist
What
will
you
get
1
Card
check
meaning
the
abolition
of
the
secret
ballot
in
the
certification
of
unions
in
the
workplace
Large
men
will
come
to
your
house
at
night
and
ask
you
to
sign
a
card
supporting
a
union
You
will
sign
2
The
so-called
Fairness
Doctrine
a
project
of
Nancy
Pelosi
and
leading
Democratic
senators
a
Hugo
Chavez-style
travesty
designed
to
abolish
conservative
talk
radio
3
Judges
who
go
beyond
even
the
constitutional
creativity
we
expect
from
Democratic
appointees
Judges
chosen
according
to
Obama's
publicly
declared
criterion
empathy
for
the
poor
or
African-American
or
gay
or
disabled
or
old
in
a
legal
system
historically
predicated
on
the
idea
of
justice
entirely
blind
to
one's
station
in
life
4
An
unprecedented
expansion
of
government
power
Yes
I
know
It
has
already
happened
A
conservative
government
has
already
partially
nationalized
the
mortgage
industry
the
insurance
industry
and
nine
of
the
largest
U.S
banks
This
is
all
generally
swallowed
because
everyone
understands
that
the
current
crisis
demands
extraordinary
measures
The
difference
is
that
conservatives
are
instinctively
inclined
to
make
such
measures
temporary
Whereas
an
Obama-Pelosi-Reid-Barney
Frank
administration
will
find
irresistible
the
temptation
to
use
the
tools
inherited
700
billion
of
largely
uncontrolled
spending
as
a
once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity
to
radically
remake
the
American
economy
and
social
compact
This
is
not
socialism
This
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
It
would
however
be
a
decidedly
leftward
move
on
the
order
of
Lyndon
Johnson's
Great
Society
The
alternative
is
a
McCain
administration
with
a
moderate
conservative
presiding
over
a
divided
government
and
generally
inclined
to
resist
a
European
social-democratic
model
of
economic
and
social
regulation
featuring
for
example
wealth-distributing
growth-killing
marginal
tax
rates
The
national
security
choice
in
this
election
is
no
contest
The
domestic
policy
choice
is
more
equivocal
because
it
is
ideological
McCain
is
the
quintessential
center-right
candidate
Yet
the
quintessential
center-right
country
is
poised
to
reject
him
The
hunger
for
anti-Republican
catharsis
and
the
blinding
promise
of
Obamian
hope
are
simply
too
strong
The
reckoning
comes
in
the
morning

A
small
reflection
about
the
relationship
between
England
and
Australia
Most
Americans
feel
proud
pleased
and
blessed
to
be
born
in
America
And
rightly
so
Australians
and
the
English
feel
similarly
and
for
similar
reasons
But
from
the
large
and
constant
stream
of
English
immigrants
arriving
in
Australia
one
gathers
that
a
lot
of
the
English
like
some
sunshine
with
their
English
heritage
And
there
is
more
than
sunshine
to
it
I
remember
a
recent
arrival
in
Australia
who
hailed
from
Yorkshire
saying
to
me
that
Australia
is
Yorkshire
with
brass
where
brass
is
Northern
slang
for
money
He
was
oversimplifying
but
there
was
a
lot
of
truth
in
what
he
said
nonetheless
The
ties
between
England
and
Australia
are
a
lot
closer
than
either
side
will
normally
admit
Australians
speak
derisively
of
the
English
calling
them
Poms
and
the
English
speak
derisively
of
Australians
calling
them
colonials
But
it
remains
true
that
both
nationalities
feel
very
much
at
home
in
the
others
country
And
I
am
probably
a
rather
extreme
example
of
that
When
I
was
growing
up
in
Australia
in
the
1950s
I
grew
up
into
a
society
that
was
very
Anglophilic
Many
Australian-born
people
still
copied
their
parents
usage
and
referred
to
England
as
home
And
we
had
a
Prime
Minister
Sir
Robert
Menzies
who
described
himself
as
British
to
his
bootstraps
And
I
remember
crying
aged
about
9
when
it
was
announced
that
the
King
had
died
An
even
stronger
influence
than
all
that
however
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
I
was
a
great
book
reader
from
an
early
age
And
most
if
not
all
boys
books
available
were
written
and
published
in
England
for
the
English
So
I
grew
up
in
a
mental
world
that
was
half-English
Which
was
a
very
good
start
on
understanding
English
thinking
So
when
I
first
arrived
in
England
in
1977
I
found
a
few
peculiarities
but
in
general
had
no
social
difficulties
which
is
saying
something
if
you
know
the
intricacies
of
English
social
rules
I
imagine
that
I
did
transgress
in
various
ways
from
time
to
time
but
never
enough
to
be
a
bother
In
fact
my
high
level
of
social
acceptance
would
have
been
the
envy
of
many
Englishmen
I
was
materially
assisted
in
that
by
the
fact
that
an
educated
Australian
accent
is
quite
close
to
RP
Oxford
English
and
accent
is
enormously
important
in
England
Any
Australian
accent
is
in
fact
closer
to
RP
than
are
many
regional
English
accents
So
I
was
often
told
in
England
that
I
had
a
soft
accent
meaning
that
although
detectably
Australian
it
was
not
beyond
the
pale
in
in
the
Home
Counties
My
conservative
politics
tend
to
go
down
well
in
the
Home
Counties
too
An
amusing
effect
of
this
close
but
usually
denied
affinity
is
the
way
that
some
Australian
women
have
constructed
for
themselves
a
version
of
English
society
In
England
there
really
is
such
a
thing
as
society
basically
the
English
aristocracy
The
Australian
version
is
of
course
self-selected
rather
than
genetically
selected
but
they
do
a
moderately
good
job
of
imitating
the
English
original
And
part
of
that
is
that
they
do
a
rather
good
job
of
imitating
the
speech
of
the
English
original
I
remember
one
example
vividly
When
I
was
talking
on
the
phone
to
Laurie
she
sounded
to
me
just
like
Margaret
who
is
an
English
lady
I
know
who
really
is
a
born
member
of
the
English
aristocracy
So
who
was
Laurie
She
was
the
daughter
of
my
father's
accountant
In
other
words
we
both
grew
up
in
a
small
Australian
country
town
going
to
school
in
bare
feet
in
a
tropical
environment
an
environment
beset
by
such
perils
as
taipan
snakes
funnelweb
spiders
box
jellyfish
finger
cherries
and
crocodiles
rather
than
the
more
pleasant
English
phenomena
of
crocuses
daffodils
cuckoos
and
skylarks
From
that
humble
beginning
however
Laurie
had
acquired
all
the
language
mannerisms
and
values
of
the
English
aristocracy
And
I
imagine
that
she
did
so
without
ever
visiting
England
It
reminds
me
of
something
that
someone
wrote
probably
Andrew
Ian
Dodge
an
Anglophilic
American
when
I
first
started
putting
up
my
Eye
on
Britain
blog
He
said
that
this
is
a
blog
about
England
from
an
outsider's
point
of
view
but
the
author
really
isn't
an
outsider
because
he
is
an
Australian
Very
insightful
Don't
Let
the
Polls
Affect
Your
Vote
They
were
wrong
in
2000
and
2004
By
Karl
Rove
There
has
been
an
explosion
of
polls
this
presidential
election
Through
yesterday
there
have
been
728
national
polls
with
head-to-head
matchups
of
the
candidates
215
in
October
alone
In
2004
there
were
just
239
matchup
polls
with
67
of
those
in
October
At
this
rate
there
may
be
almost
as
many
national
polls
in
October
of
2008
as
there
were
during
the
entire
year
in
2004
Some
polls
are
sponsored
by
reputable
news
organizations
others
by
publicity-eager
universities
or
polling
firms
on
the
make
None
have
the
scientific
precision
we
imagine
For
example
academics
gathered
by
the
American
Political
Science
Association
at
the
Marriott
Wardman
Park
Hotel
in
Washington
on
Aug
31
2000
to
make
forecasts
declared
that
Al
Gore
would
be
the
winner
Their
models
told
them
so
Mr
Gore
would
receive
between
53
and
60
of
the
two-party
vote
Gov
George
W
Bush
would
get
between
just
40
and
47
Impersonal
demographic
and
economic
forces
had
settled
the
contest
they
said
They
were
wrong
Right
now
all
the
polls
show
Barack
Obama
ahead
of
John
McCain
but
the
margins
vary
widely
in
part
because
some
polls
use
an
expanded
definition
of
a
likely
voter
while
others
use
a
traditional
polling
model
which
assumes
turnout
will
mirror
historical
trends
but
with
a
higher
turnout
among
African-Americans
and
young
voters
On
Monday
there
were
seven
nationwide
polls
with
the
candidates
as
close
as
three
points
in
the
Investors
Business
Daily/TIPP
poll
and
as
far
apart
as
10
points
in
Gallup's
expanded
model
On
Tuesday
the
Gallup
traditional
model
poll
had
the
candidates
separated
by
two
points
and
the
Pew
poll
had
them
separated
by
15
On
Wednesday
Battleground
Rasmussen
and
Gallup
traditional
model
polls
had
the
candidates
separated
by
three
points
while
Diageo/Hotline
and
Gallup
expanded
model
polls
had
the
spread
at
seven
points
Polls
can
reveal
underlying
or
emerging
trends
and
help
campaigns
decide
where
to
focus
The
danger
is
that
commentators
use
them
to
declare
a
race
over
before
the
votes
are
in
This
can
demoralize
the
underdog's
supporters
depressing
turnout
I
know
that
from
experience
On
election
night
in
2000
Al
Hunt
then
a
columnist
for
this
newspaper
and
a
commentator
on
CNN
was
the
first
TV
talking
head
to
erroneously
declare
that
Florida's
polls
had
closed
when
those
in
the
Panhandle
were
open
for
another
hour
Shortly
before
8
p.m
Eastern
Standard
Time
Judy
Woodruff
said
A
big
call
to
make
CNN
announces
that
we
call
Florida
in
the
Al
Gore
column
Mr
Hunt
and
Ms
Woodruff
were
not
only
wrong
What
they
did
was
harmful
We
know
for
example
that
turnout
in
2000
compared
to
1996
improved
more
in
states
whose
polls
had
closed
by
the
time
Ms
Woodruff
all
but
declared
the
contest
over
The
data
suggests
that
as
many
as
500,000
people
in
the
Midwest
and
West
didn't
bother
to
vote
after
the
networks
indicated
Florida
cinched
the
race
for
Mr
Gore
I
recall
too
the
media's
screwup
in
2004
when
exit-polling
data
leaked
in
the
afternoon
It
showed
President
Bush
losing
Pennsylvania
by
17
points
New
Hampshire
by
18
behind
among
white
males
in
Florida
and
projected
South
Carolina
and
Colorado
too
close
to
call
It
looked
like
the
GOP
would
be
wiped
out
Bob
Shrum
famously
became
the
first
to
congratulate
Sen
John
Kerry
by
addressing
him
as
President
Kerry
Commentators
let
the
exit
polls
color
their
coverage
for
hours
until
their
certainty
was
undone
by
actual
vote
tallies
Polls
have
proliferated
this
year
in
part
because
it
is
much
easier
for
journalists
to
devote
the
limited
space
in
their
papers
or
on
TV
to
the
horse-race
aspect
of
the
election
rather
than
its
substance
And
I
admit
I've
aided
and
abetted
this
process
In
the
campaign's
final
week
though
the
candidates
can
offer
little
new
substance
so
attention
turns
to
the
political
landscape
and
there's
no
question
Mr
McCain
is
in
a
difficult
place
The
last
national
poll
that
showed
Mr
McCain
ahead
came
out
Sept
25
and
the
232
polls
since
then
have
all
shown
Mr
Obama
leading
Only
one
time
in
the
past
14
presidential
elections
has
a
candidate
won
the
popular
vote
and
the
Electoral
College
after
trailing
in
the
Gallup
Poll
the
week
before
the
election
Ronald
Reagan
in
1980
But
the
question
that
matters
is
the
margin
If
Mr
McCain
is
down
by
3
his
task
is
doable
if
difficult
If
he's
down
by
9
his
task
is
essentially
impossible
In
truth
however
no
one
knows
for
sure
what
kind
of
polling
deficit
is
insurmountable
or
even
which
poll
is
correct
All
of
us
should
act
with
the
proper
understanding
that
nothing
is
yet
decided
As
for
me
I've
already
cast
my
absentee
ballot
in
Kerr
County
Texas
joyfully
enthusiastically
marking
the
straight
Republican
column
I
would
like
to
have
joined
the
line
Tuesday
outside
the
polling
place
in
Ingram
where
I've
been
registered
the
past
few
years
But
I
will
be
in
New
York
part
of
the
vast
horde
analyzing
exit
polls
dissecting
returns
and
pontificating
on
consequences
I'll
thoroughly
enjoy
myself
that
night
and
probably
feel
guilty
the
next
morning
But
this
year's
728
national
polls
and
the
thousands
of
state
polls
made
me
do
it

McCain
is
Winning
Here
is
the
Proof
Some
not
unreasonable
optimism
from
Evan
Sayet
John
McCain
has
the
upper
hand
in
the
November
4th
election
How
can
I
say
that
when
the
polls
show
Obama
leading
by
anywhere
from
one
IBD
the
most
accurate
pollster
the
last
time
out
to
13
from
the
folks
who
brought
you
Dan
Rather
and
the
use
of
forged
documents
to
try
and
steal
the
election
just
four
years
ago
A
brief
look
at
the
methodolgy
of
these
polls
the
degree
of
over-sampling
of
Democrats
corresponding
almost
to
perfection
with
the
degree
of
Obama's
lead
in
them
shows
a
tight
race
with
McCain
actually
leading
by
a
point
or
two
This
reality
is
underscored
by
events
within
the
campaigns
which
when
analyzed
show
an
Obama
camp
in
desperation
1
The
politically
savvy
Governor
of
Pennsylvania
Ed
Rendell
is
clearly
panicking
Rendell
has
publicly
begged
the
Obama
campaign
to
send
their
star
back
to
the
state
for
no
less
than
THREE
major
events
to
close
the
deal
on
a
state
that
should
have
been
closed
for
the
leftists
month
ago
And
it's
no
wonder
the
campaign
is
panicking
an
Obama
internal
poll
was
accidentally
released
to
the
media
and
it
shows
The
Anointed
One
in
a
statistical
dead
heat
with
his
American
hero
opponent
And
this
was
BEFORE
John
Murtha
basically
parrotted
Obama's
San
Francisco
speech
in
which
The
Anointed
One
candidly
spoke
of
his
disdain
for
the
people
of
Pennsylvania
Murtha
may
not
be
as
eloquent
as
The
One
but
the
condescension
and
disrespect
that
he
has
for
the
people
who
cling
to
their
Christianity
and
constitutional
rights
is
exactly
the
same
Murtha's
poll
numbers
are
cratering
I
can't
imagine
that
Obama
who
shares
Murtha's
convictions
aren't
doing
the
same
If
I
were
a
Republican
strategist
I'd
be
runing
an
ad
every
ten
minutes
with
nothing
but
these
Democrats
own
words
and
the
tag
line
If
this
is
what
they
THINK
of
you
imagine
what
they
plan
to
do
TO
you

Obama
has
suspended
campaigning
something
he
refused
to
do
to
help
quell
the
financial
crisis
that
he
sees
as
working
in
his
favor
in
order
to
visit
his
ailing
grandmother
Since
this
is
the
same
grandmother
he
had
cynically
thrown
under
a
bus
in
his
wonderfully
eloquent
speech
in
defense
of
his
mentor
Jeremiah
Wright
a
woman
he
later
described
as
nothing
more
than
a
typical
white
woman
it
is
fair
to
be
cynical
about
his
real
purpose
in
suddenly
caring
so
much
about
her
he
would
actually
visit
her
when
he
barely
spent
a
minute
with
her
just
a
few
weeks
ago
when
he
vacationed
in
Hawaii
I
suspect
more
than
anything
it
was
a
desperate
attempt
to
get
his
name
out
of
the
news
for
a
few
days
to
let
the
stink
of
his
campaign
go
away
after
several
disastrous
stories
made
their
way
into
the
public
consciousness
Over
the
past
few
weeks
a
narrative
of
Obama's
thuggery
was
more
and
more
coming
to
the
fore
Despite
the
leftist
media's
best
efforts
to
protect
him
the
actions
of
his
minions
in
the
thugocracy
of
ACORN
his
allies
vicious
attacks
on
a
plumber
who
merely
asked
a
policy
question
and
the
close
ties
of
Obama
to
the
terrorist
who
segued
from
murdering
Americans
to
brainwashing
their
children
more
and
more
reminded
Americans
that
they
really
don't
know
this
neophyte
first
term
junior
senator
who
somehow
managed
to
rise
to
the
top
of
Chicago's
corrupt
political
landscape
by
affiliating
himself
with
the
worst
of
the
worst
of
the
worst
A
quick
trip
to
visit
granny
and
suddenly
questioning
the
grieving
candidate
would
be
seen
as
below
the
belt
Meanwhile
it's
obvious
that
Obama
DIDN'T
suspend
his
campaign
but
instead
used
his
time
in
Hawaii
to
put
together
what
his
campaign
is
calling
a
major
economic
policy
speech
Unless
grandma
is
a
Harvard
MBA
it's
highly
unlikely
he
wrote
edited
and
rehearsed
this
speech
at
the
bedside
of
the
woman
he
cares
so
much
about
3
Candidates
who
are
well
on
their
way
to
a
landslide
do
not
make
major
speeches
in
which
they
introduce
new
policy
Candidates
who
recognize
that
there
is
a
deep
mistrust
of
their
policies
do
Again
despite
the
best
efforts
of
the
leftist
media
Obama's
deeply
held
Marxist
beliefs
have
made
it
into
the
minds
of
mainstream
America
and
Obama
without
any
lead
in
the
polls
feels
he
must
explain
away
the
evidence
4
If
you'll
recall
the
reason
the
God
of
Change
chose
Joseph
Robinette
Biden
a
guy
who
has
been
sitting
in
the
US
Senate
since
he
was
about
the
same
age
as
Britney
Spears
is
today
was
because
he
would
quell
the
rightful
fears
of
an
electorate
that
recognizes
Obama's
utter
lack
of
executive
or
foreign
policy
experience
Now
Joe
has
shown
himself
to
be
well
to
be
nice
about
it
wholly
unhinged
From
ordering
cripples
to
stand
up
to
describing
Obama's
fiscal
policy
in
three
letters...J-O-B-S
to
his
belief
that
FDR
was
president
in
1929
and
that
Americans
all
sat
around
their
televisions
watching
him
Biden's
mental
health
needs
to
be
seriously
questioned
These
insanities
however
pale
in
comparison
to
Biden's
promise
that
should
Obama
somehow
manage
to
win
or
steal
the
election
there
will
be
an
international
crisis
within
six
months
BROUGHT
ON
BY
OBAMA
not
to
mention
Biden's
expounding
on
the
point
by
saying
Obama's
policies
will
appear
to
be
the
wrong
response
but
trust
us
the
wholly
unknown
Obama
at
the
helm
the
mentally
unstable
Biden
his
number
two
Just
in
case
you
think
the
recognition
of
Biden's
mental
instability
is
just
my
own
consider
that
even
those
fun-loving
Republican-hating
kids
at
Saturday
Night
Live
couldn't
help
but
spoof
Biden's
insanity
titling
their
opening
piece
this
week
Sen
Biden
and
Rep
Murtha
Say
Crazy
Things
What
followed
was
an
almost
word-for-word
re-enactment
of
Biden's
actual
speech
Perhaps
worst
of
all
for
the
leftists
is
that
cracks
are
beginning
to
appear
in
the
monolithic
and
utterly
corrupt
media
coverage
SNL's
lampooning
of
Biden
is
but
one
example
Another
is
an
interview
that
took
place
this
week
where
Biden
was
actually
asked
a
tough
question
or
two
Biden
of
course
failed
miserably
which
in
turn
brought
on
the
usual
response
from
the
Obama
camp
the
thuggish
attempt
to
destroy
not
Joe
the
Plumber
but
Barbara
West
one
of
the
few
reporters
Biden
has
met
who
doesn't
work
inside
the
cocoon
of
the
Beltway
or
have
aspirations
to
the
anchor
desk
in
leftist
New
York
City
Put
together
the
panic
in
PA
the
sudden
suspension
of
the
Obama
campaign
the
need
for
a
major
speech
on
economic
policy
the
meltdown
of
the
experienced
one
on
the
ticket
the
gathering
evidence
of
Obama's
ties
to
thugs
criminals
and
terrorists
the
over
sampling
of
Democrats
in
the
polls
and
more
and
you
get
a
clue
as
to
where
we
really
are
in
this
campaign
With
ten
days
or
so
to
go
Obama's
making
moves
of
desperation

Group
Pride
insecurity
and
the
Left
Strictly
speaking
the
generalizability
of
the
research
below
is
limited
by
the
sample
they
used
but
the
conclusions
are
very
ancient
and
almost
certainly
true
In
ancient
Athens
hubris
arrogant
pride
was
actually
considered
a
crime
while
megalopsuchia
proper
pride
big
spiritedness
was
a
virtue
I
follow
the
report
below
with
a
few
notes
about
the
wider
implications
of
the
research
From
screaming
baseball
fans
to
political
rally-goers
groups
that
engage
in
boastful
self-aggrandizing
may
be
trying
to
mask
insecurity
and
low
social
status
Our
results
suggest
that
hubristic
pompous
displays
of
group
pride
might
actually
be
a
sign
of
group
insecurity
as
opposed
to
a
sign
of
strength
said
researcher
Cynthia
Pickett
associate
professor
of
psychology
at
the
University
of
California
Davis
The
new
study
reveals
how
two
types
of
pride
are
related
to
a
person's
good
feelings
about
one
social
group
or
another
to
which
they
belong
These
good
feelings
could
come
from
being
a
Los
Angeles
Lakers
fan
when
they
win
a
war
veteran
a
member
of
a
particular
ethnic
group
or
a
sorority
gal
or
fraternity
brother
But
while
authentic
pride
is
linked
with
real
confidence
in
your
group
hubristic
pride
is
a
false
arrogance
that
belies
insecurities
about
one's
group
These
results
build
on
past
research
showing
similar
pride
characteristics
in
individuals
It
turns
out
people
who
have
the
hubristic
collective
pride
in
their
group
underlying
it
all
is
an
insecurity
about
whether
the
group
is
good
enough
really
said
researcher
Jessica
Tracy
a
psychologist
at
the
University
of
British
Columbia
The
research
was
presented
last
week
at
a
meeting
of
the
Society
for
Experimental
Social
Psychology
in
Sacramento
In
three
studies
Pickett
Tracy
and
their
colleagues
surveyed
more
than
300
undergraduate
students
first
asking
each
participant
to
write
about
an
experience
when
they
felt
proud
of
their
group
In
one
of
these
studies
students
had
to
recall
the
UC
Davis
football
win
over
Stanford
In
another
Asian
American
students
were
asked
to
write
about
a
proud
experience
tied
with
their
ethnic
background
Other
experiences
ranged
from
sports
team
wins
to
achievements
by
sororities
say
raising
a
big
chunk
of
money
for
a
charity
Each
participant
then
rated
to
what
extent
they
would
use
certain
words
to
describe
themselves
at
the
time
of
the
event
or
achievement
Some
of
the
descriptors
indicated
hubristic
pride
such
as
snobbish
pompous
and
smug
while
others
were
linked
with
authentic
pride
such
as
accomplished
successful
and
confident
Students
also
answered
questions
about
the
status
of
the
group
including
whether
the
group
was
valued
by
non-members
whether
they
themselves
thought
highly
of
the
group
whether
the
group
was
under
threat
or
in
competition
with
another
group
and
other
group-related
questions
The
results
showed
that
groups
in
which
individuals
boasted
and
gloated
a
sign
of
hubristic
pride
tended
to
have
low
social
status
or
they
were
vulnerable
to
threats
from
other
groups
So
the
worse
the
person
felt
about
their
group's
status
as
well
as
how
badly
they
thought
the
public
viewed
the
group
the
more
likely
that
member
would
experience
that
empty
boastful
pride
In
contrast
those
groups
that
expressed
pride
by
humbly
focusing
on
members
efforts
and
hard
work
tended
to
have
high
social
standing
in
both
the
public
and
personal
eyes
Hubristic
pride
can
rear
its
ugly
head
in
both
small
groups
like
sports
teams
and
larger
groups
like
citizens
of
a
country
A
lot
of
this
has
real-world
implications
Tracy
told
LiveScience
There
are
some
kinds
of
collective
pride
where
people
get
really
angry
and
hostile
and
feel
like
it's
not
just
that
my
group
is
great
but
my
group
is
better
She
added
You
can
think
of
it
as
the
distinction
between
nationalism
and
patriotism
with
nationalism
being
the
sense
of
it's
not
just
that
I
love
my
country
it's
that
my
country
is
best
When
group
members
show
signs
of
hubristic
pride
such
as
making
grandiose
statements
about
their
country
that
could
be
a
sign
of
underlying
insecurity
the
researchers
said
When
you
hear
groups
starting
to
get
into
that
type
of
rhetoric
it
may
be
because
they're
starting
to
realize
they're
in
a
losing
position
and
that
they
need
to
do
something
to
try
to
drum
up
respect
to
drum
up
the
kind
of
status
that
they
feel
they're
lacking

The
first
thing
that
needs
to
be
stressed
about
the
above
findings
something
the
authors
themselves
imply
is
that
not
all
group
loyalty
is
dysfunctional
Tribalism
or
group
action
is
very
common
in
the
animal
world
from
ants
to
apes
and
it
is
part
of
humanity
too
Leftists
tend
to
deny
that
however
They
see
any
kind
of
group
loyalty
such
as
patriotism
as
primitive
And
tribalism
certainly
is
a
prominent
feature
of
primitive
societies
That
something
is
primitive
does
not
mean
that
it
is
weak
however
And
in
fact
tribal
loyalties
of
one
sort
or
another
still
to
this
day
dominate
most
human
societies
In
Muslim
lands
for
instance
there
is
virtually
no
loyalty
to
the
nation
All
loyalty
is
to
your
tribe
to
your
clan
to
your
kinship
group
or
to
your
religion
As
Emmanuel
Todd
a
French
Leftist
historian
correctly
pointed
out
it
is
the
Anglo-Saxons
who
are
deviant
To
Southern
Europeans
the
English
family
is
incomprehensible
It
appears
pathologically
fractionated
Instead
of
strong
family
loyalties
the
English
simply
go
their
own
way
once
they
leave
home
and
have
almost
no
further
contact
with
one-another
by
normal
human
standards
I
saw
this
in
the
late
60s
when
I
was
doorknocking
with
a
social
survey
in
an
ethnically
mixed
area
of
Sydney
One
of
the
questions
I
asked
was
How
often
do
you
see
relatives
The
Greeks
and
Italians
would
usually
say
Every
weekend
By
contrast
about
half
the
Anglo-Australians
said
Never
So
if
even
family
ties
are
so
weak
among
Anglo-Saxons
one
can
understand
that
tribal
loyalties
are
very
limited
usually
seen
only
in
attachment
to
particular
sporting
teams
Sport
is
a
re-enactment
of
real
combat
so
it
is
a
very
primitive
thing
and
draws
out
primitive
reflexes
But
tribalism
DOES
have
some
life
among
Anglo-Saxons
outside
sport
In
particular
Anglo-Saxons
do
have
some
attachment
to
their
own
nation
and
ethnic
group
They
put
up
surprisingly
well
with
having
other
ethnic
groups
living
among
them
but
their
preference
nonetheless
is
generally
for
their
own
ethnic
group
See
here
for
instance
And
this
tattered
remnant
of
group
loyalty
is
what
Leftist
routinely
stigmatize
as
racism
Ironically
however
it
is
Leftists
themselves
who
seem
to
have
the
strongest
group
orientation
Contrast
the
lukewarm
support
of
conservatives
for
McCain
with
the
hysterical
adulation
for
Obama
on
the
Left
And
from
Hegel
through
Hitler
Ein
Volk
ein
Reich
ein
Fuehrer
to
Obama
it
is
Leftists
who
glorify
unity
and
seem
to
regard
as
ideal
an
anthill
type
of
existence
where
everybody
obeys
implicitly
direction
from
the
top
So
Leftists
are
clearly
the
political
fanatics
And
the
research
above
does
therefore
identify
them
as
the
most
insecure
And
there
is
reason
for
that
insecurity
and
its
compensatory
fanaticism
They
know
that
what
they
really
want
is
the
utter
destruction
of
the
system
in
which
they
live
and
there
is
always
a
great
risk
that
the
mask
will
come
off
that
and
expose
them
for
the
haters
and
destroyers
that
they
are
And
that
Islamic
hypersensitivity
about
insults
reflects
insecurity
is
a
common
observation
They
certainly
have
little
to
be
proud
of
by
way
of
real
recent
achievements
and
their
sensitivity
to
slights
shows
that
they
know
that
a
low
opinion
of
them
and
their
hamstrung
lifestyle
has
some
justification
By
contrast
cartoons
ridiculing
Christians
are
routine
usually
from
the
Left
but
I
have
yet
to
hear
of
any
Christian
demands
to
behead

that

and

would
not

A

storm
of
socialism
has
been
developed
by
shrewd
people
behind
the
scene
a
corrupt
leftist

careful

Paul
Krugman's
explanation
of
the

pure
baloney

that

might
call
brilliant
In
fact
if
he
had
worked
for
a

he
would
have
been
fired
My
point
is
that
accepting
as
accurate
economic
predictions
from
economists
who
ignore
both
monetary
and
real
factors
is
akin
to
playing
Russian

The

bigger
than
you
think
Obama's
rich
targets

not
rich
at
all
They
are
high-income
earners
many
of
whom
believe
that
by
rich
Obama
means
the
likes

But
the
real
rich
will
escape
Obama's
destructive
tax
net
because
it
is
designed
to
haul
in
incomes
and
not
wealth
If
Obama
were
really
sincere
about
taxing
the
rich
he
would
have
proposed
a
wealth
tax
instead
of
taxes
on
getting
wealthy
Obama's
campaign
built
on
lies
Journalists
have
delivered
the
equivalent
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
free
advertising
for
Obama
with
puff
piece
reporting
on
his
campaign
and
far
less
favorable
coverage
of
the
McCain
campaign
Not
surprisingly
the
mainstream
media
have
been
unconcerned
about
Obama's
brazen
dishonesty
Argentina's
Obama
policy
of
spreading
the
wealth
sinks
the
economy
A
massive
surge
in
government
spending
socialist
redistribution
schemes
confiscation
of
private
pension
funds
and
a
contempt
for
the
laws
of
economics
sent
the
Argentinean
economy
into
a
downward
spiral
These
are
also
Obama's
policies
He
and
his
fellow
Democrats
are
also
greedily
eyeing
401(k)s
The
financial
crisis
and
the
worst

question
Because
of
those
earlier
political
interventions
there
are
more
malinvestments
than
ever
The
liquidation
of
these
massive
malinvestments
would
be
so
jarring
that
all
of
official
Washington
is
striving
to
postpone
the
day
of
reckoning
with

and
more

Obama's

If

undoubtedly
live
up

He
will
certainly
institute

Sarah
Palin's
a
Brainiac
by
Elaine
Lafferty
The
former
editor
in
chief
of
Ms
magazine
and
a
Democrat
on
what
she
learned
on
a
campaign
plane
with
the
would-be
VP
It's
difficult
not
to
froth
when
one
reads
as
I
did
again
and
again
this
week
doubts
about
Sarah
Palin's
intelligence
coming
especially
from
women
such
as
PBS's
Bonnie
Erbe
who
as
near
as
I
recall
has
not
herself
heretofore
been
burdened
with
the
Susan
Sontag
of
Journalism
moniker
As
Fred
Barnes-God
help
me
I'm
agreeing
with
Fred
Barnes-suggests
in
the
Weekly
Standard
these
high
toned
and
authoritative
dismissals
come
from
people
who
have
never
met
or
spoken
with
Sarah
Palin
Those
who
know
her
love
her
or
hate
her
offer
no
such
criticism
They
know
what
I
know
and
I
learned
it
from
spending
just
a
little
time
traveling
on
the
cramped
campaign
plane
this
week
Sarah
Palin
is
very
smart
I'm
a
Democrat
but
I've
worked
as
a
consultant
with
the
McCain
campaign
since
shortly
after
Palin's
nomination
Last
week
there
was
the
thought
that
as
a
former
editor-in-chief
of
Ms
magazine
as
well
as
a
feminist
activist
in
my
pre-journalism
days
I
might
be
helpful
in
contributing
to
a
speech
that
Palin
had
long
wanted
to
give
on
women's
rights
What
is
often
called
her
confidence
is
actually
a
rarity
in
national
politics
I
saw
a
woman
who
knows
exactly
who
she
is
Now
by
smart
I
don't
refer
to
a
person
who
is
wily
or
calculating
or
nimble
in
the
way
of
certain
talented
athletes
who
we
admire
but
suspect
don't
really
have
serious
brains
in
their
skulls
I
mean
instead
a
mind
that
is
thoughtful
curious
with
a
discernable
pattern
of
associative
thinking
and
insight
Palin
asks
questions
and
probes
linkages
and
logic
that
bring
to
mind
a
quirky
law
professor
I
once
had
Palin
is
more
than
a
quick
study
I'd
heard
rumors
around
the
campaign
of
her
photographic
memory
and
frankly
I
watched
it
in
action
She
sees
She
processes
She
questions
and
only
then
she
acts
What
is
often
called
her
confidence
is
actually
a
rarity
in
national
politics
I
saw
a
woman
who
knows
exactly
who
she
is
For
all
those
old
enough
to
remember
Senator
Sam
Ervin
the
brilliant
strict
constitutional
constructionist
and
chairman
of
the
Senate
Watergate
Committee
whose
patois
included
I'm
just
a
country
lawyer
Yup
Palin
is
that
smart
So
no
simple
task
then
this
speech
on
women's
rights
For
the
sin
of
being
a
Christian
personally
opposed
to
abortion
Palin
is
being
pilloried
by
the
inside-the-Beltway
Democrat
feminist
establishment
Yes
she
is
anti-abortion
And
yes
instead
of
buying
organic
New
Zealand
lamb
at
Whole
Foods
she
joins
other
Alaskans
in
hunting
for
food
That's
it
She
is
not
a
right-wing
nut
and
all
the
rest
of
the
Internet
drivel-the
book
banning
at
the
Library
the
rape
kits
decision
is
nonsense
I
digress
Palin's
role
in
this
campaign
was
to
energize
the
Republican
base
which
she
has
inarguably
done
She
also
was
expected
to
reach
out
to
Hillary
Clinton
moderates
Right
Only
a
woman
would
get
both
those
jobs
in
either
party
Look
I
am
obviously
personally
pro-choice
and
I
disagree
with
McCain
and
Palin
on
that
and
a
few
other
issues
But
like
many
other
Democrats
including
Lynn
Rothschild
I'm
tired
of
the
Democratic
Party
taking
women
for
granted
I
also
happen
to
believe
Sarah
Palin
supports
women's
rights
deeply
and
passionately
More

The
Truman
Show
How
McCain
Could
Pull
Off
a
Final
Week
Upset
The
most
reliable
surveys
put
McCain
five
to
seven
points
behind
Obama
as
we
enter
the
last
week
of
this
interminable
campaign
But
in
a
race
that
will
be
famous
for
years
afterwards
for
its
volatility
it
is
not
too
late
for
the
Republican
to
pull
out
a
victory
For
Harry
Truman
in
1948
the
presidential
race
shifted
dramatically
in
the
final
week
and
it's
happened
three
more
times
in
the
past
30
years
In
1980
Reagan
came
from
eight
points
behind
to
a
solid
victory
by
winning
his
sole
debate
with
Carter
in
the
last
week
of
October
In
1992
Clinton
who
had
fallen
behind
in
the
polls
because
of
the
pounding
he
was
taking
over
his
liberalism
and
propensity
to
raise
taxes
surged
ahead
of
Bush
when
Special
Prosecutor
Lawrence
Walsh
announced
that
he
was
indicting
Defense
Secretary
Casper
Cap
Weinberger
an
indication
of
Bush's
possible
complicity
in
the
Iran-Contra
scandal
And
in
2000
Bush's
three-to-four
point
lead
in
the
polls
was
erased
over
the
final
weekend
when
reports
surfaced
that
he
had
been
cited
for
DWI
20
years
before
and
had
not
revealed
the
fact
to
the
public
Bush
still
won
the
election
of
course
but
Gore
won
the
popular
vote
by
half
a
point
What
does
McCain
have
to
do
to
pull
off
a
similar
shift
this
time
1
Use
the
stock
market
crash
to
highlight
the
tax
issue
With
the
Dow
Jones
dropping
each
day
by
hundreds
of
points
this
election
is
being
held
against
a
backdrop
of
economic
fear
unlike
any
since
the
Depression
Almost
every
reputable
economist
agrees
that
it
would
be
catastrophic
to
add
to
the
economy's
woes
by
raising
the
capital
gains
tax
But
Obama
is
on
record
as
favoring
an
increase
from
15
to
20
and
suggested
during
the
primaries
that
he
would
consider
hitting

Bring
back
Rev
Jeremiah
Wright
For
reasons
that
are
beyond
me
John
McCain
has
vowed
not
to
make
an
issue
out
of
Rev
Wright's
extreme
anti-American
statements
But
that
should
not
stop
independent
expenditure
and
527
groups
from
raising
the
issue

Warn
voters
of
impending
socialism
in
America
The
recent
bailout
legislation
puts
the
United
States
government
inside
the
ownership
management
and
direction
of
many
of
our
major
companies
and
financial
institutions
The
bureaucrats
have
entered
as
firefighters
trying
to
extinguish
the
blazes
that
threaten
to
consume
these
companies
But
once
the
flames
are
put
out
will
the
firefighters
go
home
or
will
they
set
up
shop
and
give
the
United
States
a
socialist
economy
akin
to
that
of
Western
European
nations
Will
the
bureaucrats
relinquish
the
power
they
are
being
given
in
a
time
of
crisis
McCain
needs
to
point
out
that
bureaucrats
never
let
go
of
power
unless
they
have
to
McCain
needs
to
point
out
that
it
was
political
meddling
by
liberals
that
led
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
to
encourage
subprime
mortgage
loans
in
the
first
place
Were
it
not
for
the
pressure
in
the
Clinton
Administration
to
expand
home
ownership
to
poor
people
and
minorities
Freddie
and
Fannie
would
not
have
relaxed
their
down
payment
policies
and
would
not
have
been
willing
to
guarantee
mortgages
without
proof
that
the
borrowers
had
sufficient
income
to
repay
the
debts
If
the
Dow
continues
to
terrify
investors
and
distract
voters
from
the
election
it
will
continue
to
bolster
Obama's
candidacy
and
his
lead
But
if
there
is
some
stability
in
the
final
week
before
the
election
there
is
every
chance
that
voters
will
take
another
look
at
Obama
and
decide
that
he
is
too
risky
By
stressing
the
tax
issue
and
the
potential
of
an
Obama
regime
to
subvert
our
free
enterprise
system
McCain
can
harness
the
crisis
and
warn
voters
of
the
impact
of
a
decision
to
elect
the
most
radical
candidate
for
president
in
our
nation's
history

The
financial
crisis
has
been
even
more
catastrophic
outside
the
USA
By
Spengler
It
wasn't
the
world
that
got
flat
contrary
to
New
York
Times
pundit
Thomas
Friedman
but
the
emerging
markets
that
got
flattened
Faddish
conventional
wisdom
over
the
past
few
years
held
that
American
influence
was
fading
as
technology
radiated
to
the
far
reaches
of
the
world
When
America's
economy
went
into
a
ditch
though
the
supposed
economic
superpowers
of
the
future
went
flying
like
children
on
skates
holding
onto
the
back
of
truck
The
American
consumer
it
turns
out
played
Atlas
to
the
global
economy
taking
the
exports
of
Asia
so
that
Asia
could
buy
the
commodities
of
Russia
Latin
America
and
Africa
Remove
the
American
consumer
and
Asian
exports
crash
taking
commodity
prices
along
with
them
The
financial
crash
exposes
the
fragility
of
large
swaths
of
the
world
The
political
consequences
will
be
terrible
The
worst
of
it
is
that
America
will
not
be
around
to
moderate
the
melee
not
if
Democratic
Senator
Barack
Obama
is
elected
president
that
is
Those
who
objected
to
America's
role
as
world
policeman
will
get
what
they
wanted
but
they
won't
like
it
a
religious
war
reaching
from
Lebanon
to
Pakistan
and
Colombian-style
narco-war
spreading
to
Mexico
and
Brazil
The
wave
of
American
self-pity
that
may
carry
Obama
to
the
White
House
stems
in
turn
from
a
global
crisis
that
has
sunk
a
good
deal
of
the
developing
world
Worst
affected
are
the
most
populous
Muslim
countries
and
Russia's
near
abroad
Pakistan
Ukraine
and
Belarus
are
out
of
funds
and
have
applied
for
help
to
the
International
Monetary
Fund
Indonesia
and
Turkey
face
drastically
increased
borrowing
and
import
costs
Iran's
economy
will
implode
with
oil
in
the
mid-US$60s
The
economic
crisis
buoyed
Obama
out
of
his
post-convention
slump
and
exposed
the
emptiness
of
the
Republicans
But
it
also
has
crushed
the
aspirations
of
the
most
populous
Muslim
countries
Even
before
the
financial
crisis
Pakistan
and
Turkey
had
turned
towards
political
Islam
Pakistan's
intelligence
service
is
providing
support
to
the
Taliban
in
Afghanistan
jeopardizing
the
Western
position
The
financial
crisis
will
push
Pakistan
further
towards
radical
Islam
Now
this
proclamation
will
be
preached
from
every
mosque
from
Tyre
to
Lahore
The
corrupt
West
tried
to
seduce
you
with
consumerism
Now
the
poisoned
gifts
of
the
West
are
shown
to
be
an
illusion
and
those
of
you
who
lusted
after
them
are
left
only
with
your
humiliation
No
one
in
Asia
it
appears
knows
how
to
make
money
when
American
import
demand
shrinks
and
when
Asian
growth
falls
raw
materials
prices
collapse
No
one
in
Latin
America
for
that
matter
seems
to
know
how
to
make
money
when
raw
materials
prices
collapse
For
all
the
preening
and
posing
of
the
emerging
world's
nouveau
riche
it
turns
out
that
the
American
consumer
was
the
center
of
the
world
economy
and
without
the
American
consumer
all
that
is
left
are
busted
stock
markets
and
bad
credit
Most
embarrassing
for
the
flat-worlders
is
the
observation
that
the
emerging
markets
crashed
when
the
world
concluded
that
Washington
would
not
be
able
to
reverse
the
financial
crisis
The
economic
bomb
that
detonated
in
America
caused
more
collateral
damage
in
the
emerging
markets
than
casualties
at
home
Until
July
2008
commodity
prices
rose
as
stock
prices
deteriorated
because
investors
falsely
assumed
that
Washington
would
set
off
a
new
wave
of
inflation
as
it
rescued
the
banking
system
The
commodity
producers
thumbed
their
collective
nose
at
economic
distress
in
the
industrial
world
and
expected
the
boom
to
go
on
forever
Once
the
markets
concluded
that
Washington
would
not
be
able
to
prevent
a
financial
collapse
the
commodity
indices
crashed
along
with
stock
prices
The
commodity
producers
went
from
boom
to
bust
almost
overnight
Iran's
theocrats
as
I
reported
in
June
Worst
of
times
for
Iran
Asia
Times
Online
June
24
2008
managed
to
steal
35
billion
from
oil
revenues
Luxury
real
estate
prices
rose
to
Parisian
levels
while
poor
Iranians
lacked
necessities
With
the
collapse
of
the
oil
price
subsidies
for
essential
items
will
disappear
and
the
regime
will
face
economic
collapse
Before
it
does
so
I
believe
Iran
will
undertake
an
adventure
to
assert
its
hegemony
in
the
region
probably
at
the
expense
of
Iraq
The
low
level
of
violence
in
Iraq
during
the
past
several
months
owes
something
to
the
skill
of
American
arms
in
the
so-called
surge
but
it
owes
even
more
to
a
tacit
agreement
between
Iran
and
the
George
W
Bush
administration
in
return
for
leashing
its
irregular
forces
in
Iraq
Iran
would
get
a
free
hand
with
Hezbollah
in
Lebanon
and
American
forbearance
with
respect
to
its
nuclear
weapons
program
The
Bush
administration's
motive
to
bribe
Iran
and
avoid
political
damage
in
Iraq
disappears
on
US
presidential
election
day
on
November
4
Whether
the
US
administration
or
for
that
matter
Israel
has
the
nerve
to
launch
an
air
strike
on
Iran's
nuclear
facilities
is
anyone's
guess
and
everyone
is
guessing
that
the
answer
is
negative
Nonetheless
Iran
has
created
the
strongest
Shi'ite
presence
since
the
original
battles
that
determined
the
succession
to
the
Prophet
Mohammed
It
can
watch
the
Shi'ite
cause
fade
away
with
the
price
of
oil
or
it
can
attempt
to
use
its
capabilities
before
they
are
lost
for
another
thousand
years
Nothing
at
all
that
we
know
of
the
Iranians
indicates
that
they
would
go
quietly
into
another
long
night
of
Sunni
oppression
Iran's
leaders
in
short
find
themselves
in
a
position
similar
to
but
more
urgent
than
the
one
that
Adolf
Hitler
described
to
his
senior
commanders
three
weeks
after
the
German
invasion
of
Poland
I
have
quoted
this
before
but
it
deserves
to
be
tattooed
onto
the
foreheads
of
analysts
who
think
that
economic
weakness
reduces
the
likelihood
of
armed
conflict
We
have
nothing
to
lose
but
much
indeed
to
gain
As
a
result
of
the
constraints
forced
upon
us
our
economic
position
is
such
that
we
cannot
hold
out
for
more
than
a
few
years
Hermann
Goering
can
confirm
this
We
have
no
other
choice
we
must
act
At
no
point
in
the
future
will
Germany
have
a
man
with
more
authority
than
I
But
I
could
be
replaced
at
any
moment
by
some
idiot
or
criminal
The
morale
of
the
German
people
is
excellent
It
can
only
worsen
from
here
Iran's
ultimate
target
will
be
Saudi
Arabia
whose
largest
oil
fields
are
found
inconveniently
in
Shi'ite-majority
areas
just
across
the
Persian
Gulf
from
Iran
The
Saudis
will
not
sit
quietly
while
Iran
gains
the
upper
hand
in
Iraq
Pakistan
and
Turkey
Sunni
powers
with
large
armies
will
be
loath
to
allow
Iran
to
dominate
the
region
and
they
also
will
be
all
the
more
dependent
on
Saudi
generosity
A
whole
generation
of
Western
analysts
looked
approving
on
Turkey's
turn
to
Islamism
as
I
reported
last
summer
Turkey
in
the
throes
of
Islamic
revolution
Asia
Times
Online
July
22
Now
Turkey
will
be
Islamist
and
broke
Turkey
paid
more
than
20
for
local
currency
deposits
in
order
to
attract
the
funds
to
finance
a
current
account
deficit
amounting
to
7
of
gross
domestic
product
The
Islamist
government
of
Prime
Minister
Recep
Tayyip
Erdogan
now
faces
the
worst
of
all
possible
worlds
The
Turkish
lira
has
lost
a
third
of
its
value
in
the
past
month
and
almost
all
of
the
devaluation
will
turn
up
in
higher
domestic
prices
Credit
availability
for
Turkish
businesses
will
vanish
and
Turkey
will
enter
a
profound
economic
crisis
A
belt
of
ungovernability
now
stretches
from
Lebanon
to
Pakistan
with
incalculable
political
and
military
consequences
I
believe
that
a
Shi'ite-Sunni
version
of
Europe's
17th-century
Thirty
Years
War
will
engulf
the
region

The
Big
Lie
of

was
that

It
was
in

typical
of
the

of
its
day
It
was
only
to
the

Some
deep
background
on
the
polls
Reader
Frogg
passed
along
this
really
interesting
commentary
from
a
professional
pollster
who
is
a
a
die
hard
Obama
supporter
and
b
laughing
at
the
public
polls
I
was
having
dinner
a
night
ago
with
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
a
statistician
for
a
well-regarded
private
polling
company
They
do
some
work
for
Republicans
in
California
but
most
of
the
work
they
do
is
for
Democrats
or
Democrat-leaning
operations
Unions
etc
Anyway
her
shop
was
retained
to
do
a
few
Presidential
polls
for
targetted
states
on
behalf
of
a
union
so
the
union
could
decide
where
to
spend
their
ad
dollars
for
the
last
week
They
did
Ohio
Florida
North
Carolina
New
Hampshire
Pennsylvania
Colorado
New
Mexico
Nevada
and
Missouri
After
mocking
the
hell
out
of
the
voter
id
spreads
used
by
Rassmussen
Zogby
etc
and
this
is
coming
from
a
committed
Dem
who
will
be
voting
for
Barry
O
she
said
the
results
of
their
polling
lead
her
to
believe
that
McCain
will
definitely
win
FL
OH
NC
MO
and
NV
She
says
Obama
definitely
wins
New
Mexico
She
said
that
Colorado
and
New
Hampshire
were
absolute
dead
heats
She
said
she
thinks
there
is
a
55
chance
Obama
holds
on
in
Pennsylvania
and
a
75
chance
McCain
wins
Virginia
She
absolutely
laughed
at
the
public
polls
showing
Obama
leading
Virginia-and
pointed
out
that
all
of
those
polls
rely
on
Dem
turnout
being
4
and
as
much
as
7
when
in
2006
Republicans
actually
had
the
advantage
by
3
She
also
pointed
out
that
the
numbers
for
Obama
in
SWVA
look
absolutely
awful
and
that
McCain
is
running
10
points
better
then
Allen
did
in
NoVa
Anyway
her
company's
conclusion
is
that
the
election
will
come
down
to
Colorado
New
Hampshire
and
the
Republican
leaning
district
in
Maine
which
in
her
opinion
might
very
well
decide
the
Presidency
apparently
the
district
in
Nebraska
that
Obama
thought
he
might
be
able
to
get
is
now
off
the
table
She
said
she
has
very
little
doubt
that
the
public
polling
is
part
of
a
concerted
voter
suppression
effort
by
the
MSM
She
said
IBD/TIPP
was
the
only
outfit
doing
public
polling
that
was
worth
a
bucket
of
warm
piss
The
turnout
model
scam
of
2008
will
be
the
big
story
of
this
election
In
my
last
post
on
polls
I
noted
how
many
of
the
polls
out
there
are
starting
to
fall
into
two
camps
The
first
camp
is
the
traditional
approach
using
historic
turnout
models
where
party
affiliation
is
actually
quite
close
as
both
sides
turn
out
their
base
equally
well
The
second
model
is
new
and
unverified
and
assumes
there
will
be
a
huge
difference
in
party
affiliation
turnout
this
year
The
first
class
of
polls
show
a
very
tight
race
the
second
class
are
so
heavily
weighted
towards
the
dems
they
assume
all
the
anger
with
the
direction
of
the
country
has
no
impact
on
Democrats
and
their
media
puppets
The
DC/NY
Political
Industrial
Complex
is
mostly
liberal
in
its
make
up
and
it
has
recently
become
more
and
more
isolated
in
its
echo
chamber
Just
look
at
how
it
reacted
to
Sarah
Palin
The
end
result
is
the
polls
of
polls
are
showing
a
classic
bimodal
result
with
clusters
of
polls
at
one
of
these
two
modes
traditional
and
extended
just
like
the
two
turnout
models
now
being
openly
produced
by
Gallup
I
think
this
pollster
has
it
about
right
LJStrata
and
DJStrata
have
been
out
doing
the
GOTV
stuff
this
week
and
what
they
find
here
in
our
part
of
Northern
Virginia
is
there
are
about
equal
numbers
of
Obama
and
McCain
supporters
but
the
Obama
supporters
are
more
open
and
the
McCain
supporters
are
a
bit
down
because
of
the
tilted
polls
The
GOP
support
is
quiet
but
just
as
massive
as
the
Obama
support
Sadly
one
of
the
better
pollsters
has
gone
to
the
dark
side
of
the
bimodal
results
Rasmussen
has
decided
to
increase
his
Democrat
edge
to
new
heights
under
the
naive
assumption
Dem
and
GOP
supporters
are
equally
engaged
in
answering
pollsters
Like
all
polling
firms
Rasmussen
Reports
weights
its
data
to
reflect
the
population
at
large
Among
other
targets
Rasmussen
Reports
weights
data
by
political
party
affiliation
using
a
dynamic
weighting
process
see
methodology
The
targets
are
not
set
arbitrarily
Rather
they
are
established
based
upon
survey
interviews
with
a
separate
sample
of
adults
nationwide
completed
during
the
preceding
six
weeks
A
total
of
500
nightly
interviews
are
conducted
for
a
total
of
21,000
interviews
over
the
six
week
period
While
it
sounds
reasonable
the
fact
is
willingness
to
participate
in
polls
may
not
be
uniform
between
the
left
and
right
And
pollsters
are
more
and
more
considered
part
of
the
problem
part
of
the
Political
Industrial
Complex
which
the
public
blames
for
the
country
being
on
the
wrong
track
by
90
There
is
a
pox
upon
all
your
houses
mentality
in
the
country
that
is
starting
to
lump
the
media
the
pollsters
the
consultants
in
with
the
politicians
from
both
sides
Trust
in
the
political
class
is
gone
Rassmussen
now
gives
the
dems
a
questionable
33-40
edge
in
turnout
Indies
at
27
Previously
in
September
he
had
Rep-Dem-Indie
RDI
at
34-39-28
Each
time
he
increased
the
dems
edge
McCain
lost
ground
duh
Let's
look
at
the
latest
Newsweek
Poll
which
has
Obama
up
12
One
look
at
the
internals
gives
the
answer
to
the
large
lead
Supposedly
from
1204
interviews
they
distilled
out
1092
Registered
Voters
which
were
further
distilled
down
to
882
Likely
Voters
Of
these
they
claim
299
Reps
380
Dems
and
381
Indies
If
we
do
the
math
the
total
sample
size
for
party
affiliates
is
1060
which
cleverly
doesn't
map
to
interviews
registered
voters
or
likely
voters
What
is
also
interesting
is
they
have
error
bars
on
their
party
ID
They
claim
the
Rep
error
bar
is
7
which
comes
out
to
2
and
the
indie/dem
error
bar
is
6
Not
sure
why
they
are
not
sure
what
party
people
claimed
they
were
associated
with
was
in
doubt
but
there
it
is
Anyway
if
we
do
the
math
the
Newsweek
RDI
turnout
model
is
28-36-36
Recall
Rasmussen's
model
was
33-40-27
I
mean
they
are
not
even
close
One
of
the
problems
is
a
lot
of
people
are
still
on
the
fence
to
some
degree
and
pollsters
are
trying
to
push
them
into
a
lean
for
one
candidate
but
this
is
very
shaky
ground
to
be
on
Look
at
this
Minnesota
poll
which
is
making
people
sit
up
and
take
notice
A
St
Cloud
State
University
poll
shows
that
Democratic
presidential
candidate
Barack
Obama
leads
Republican
opponent
John
McCain
42
percent
to
37
percent
in
Minnesota
After
earlier
surveys
showed
DFL
challenger
Al
Franken
with
an
edge
the
SCSU
poll
shows
Republican
U.S
Sen
Norm
Coleman
leading
with
36
percent
compared
with
27
percent
for
Franken
Independence
Party
candidate
Dean
Barkley
trails
with
16
percent
Not
only
is
McCain
down
only
5
there
are
an
enormous
number
of
undecideds
given
the
low
numbers
for
both
candidates
I
included
the
surprise
Senate
seat
race
for
comparison
because
it
shows
similar
numbers
for
Coleman
and
Franken
with
the
Rep
out
front
but
there
is
a
substantial
number
voting
for
a
3rd
party
candidate
in
that
race
There
is
no
major
3rd
party
candidate
on
the
national
level
In
MN
and
with
this
poll
the
race
is
wide
open
because
of
the
enormous
number
of
uncommitted
voters
Obama
could
easily
lose
this
state
if
this
poll
is
to
be
believed
So
what
do
we
have
We
have
polls
using
dynamic
turnout
models
which
link
willingness
to
take
a
poll
to
willingness
to
get
out
and
vote
a
very
suspect
assumption
IMHO
Especially
since
different
pollsters
are
deriving
vastly
different
turnout
models
as
a
result
of
this
approach
All
these
polls
share
one
thing
they
tend
to
show
massive
Obama
leads
while
the
traditional
turnout
models
show
a
tight
or
tightening
race

Congressional
folly
is
destroying
the
basis
of
America's
prosperity
By
ARTHUR
B
LAFFER
Financial
panics
if
left
alone
rarely
cause
much
damage
to
the
real
economy
output
employment
or
production
Asset
values
fall
sharply
and
wipe
out
those
who
borrowed
and
lent
too
much
thereby
redistributing
wealth
from
the
foolish
to
the
prudent
This
process
is
the
topic
of
Nassim
Nicholas
Taleb's
book
Fooled
by
Randomness
When
markets
are
free
asset
values
are
supposed
to
go
up
and
down
and
competition
opens
up
opportunities
for
profits
and
losses
Profits
and
stock
appreciation
are
not
rights
but
rewards
for
insight
mixed
with
a
willingness
to
take
risk
People
who
buy
homes
and
the
banks
who
give
them
mortgages
are
no
different
in
principle
than
investors
in
the
stock
market
commodity
speculators
or
shop
owners
Good
decisions
should
be
rewarded
and
bad
decisions
should
be
punished
The
market
does
just
that
with
its
profits
and
losses
No
one
likes
to
see
people
lose
their
homes
when
housing
prices
fall
and
they
can't
afford
to
pay
their
mortgages
nor
does
any
one
of
us
enjoy
watching
banks
go
belly-up
for
making
subprime
loans
without
enough
equity
But
the
taxpayers
had
nothing
to
do
with
either
side
of
the
mortgage
transaction
If
the
house's
value
had
appreciated
believe
you
me
the
overleveraged
homeowner
and
the
overly
aggressive
bank
would
never
have
shared
their
gain
with
taxpayers
Housing
price
declines
and
their
consequences
are
signals
to
the
market
to
stop
building
so
many
houses
pure
and
simple
But
here's
the
rub
Now
enter
the
government
and
the
prospects
of
a
kinder
and
gentler
economy
To
alleviate
the
obvious
hardships
to
both
homeowners
and
banks
the
government
commits
to
buy
mortgages
and
inject
capital
into
banks
which
on
the
face
of
it
seems
like
a
very
nice
thing
to
do
But
unfortunately
in
this
world
there
is
no
tooth
fairy
And
the
government
doesn't
create
anything
it
just
redistributes
Whenever
the
government
bails
someone
out
of
trouble
they
always
put
someone
into
trouble
plus
of
course
a
toll
for
the
troll
Every
100
billion
in
bailout
requires
at
least
130
billion
in
taxes
where
the
30
billion
extra
is
the
cost
of
getting
government
involved
If
you
don't
believe
me
just
watch
how
Congress
and
Barney
Frank
run
the
banks
If
you
thought
they
did
a
bad
job
running
the
post
office
Amtrak
Fannie
Mae
Freddie
Mac
and
the
military
just
wait
till
you
see
what
they'll
do
with
Wall
Street

Justice
and
Vote
Fraud
Lawyers
who
supervise
voting
rights
are
Obama
donors
We've
all
read
a
lot
about
the
politicization
of
the
Justice
Department
in
recent
years
and
that
political
pounding
is
having
an
ironic
effect
The
prosecutors
who
are
supposed
to
guard
against
voter
fraud
don't
seem
very
interested
in
running
the
political
risk
of
doing
their
job
If
voter
fraud
would
ever
be
ripe
for
investigation
this
would
seem
to
be
the
year
with
the
Association
of
Community
Organizations
for
Reform
Now
Acorn
having
been
caught
filing
thousands
of
bogus
voter
registrations
in
at
least
14
states
Acorn's
history
of
deceit
and
the
national
sweep
of
today's
scandal
demand
a
federal
probe
Safeguarding
the
integrity
of
the
vote
is
every
bit
as
important
as
protecting
access
to
the
polls
yet
Democrats
want
Justice
to
pay
attention
only
to
the
latter
House
Judiciary
Chairman
John
Conyers
recently
sent
two
letters
to
Attorney
General
Michael
Mukasey
deploring
a
news
leak
that
the
FBI
is
investigating
Acorn
and
warning
Justice
to
focus
instead
on
voter
suppression
Barack
Obama
has
also
joined
in
this
political
intimidation
demanding
in
two
letters
that
Mr
Mukasey
appoint
a
special
prosecutor
to
investigate
Justice
staff
who
he
claims
are
engaged
in
unlawful
coordination
with
John
McCain's
campaign
to
pursue
so-called
election
fraud
There
is
zero
evidence
that
such
coordination
exists
but
it
is
remarkable
that
a
Presidential
nominee
would
dismiss
election
fraud
as
a
myth
The
lawyers
at
the
Civil
Rights
Division
are
already
falling
into
line
Justice
recently
decided
to
reverse
a
policy
in
place
since
2002
to
send
criminal
attorneys
and
other
federal
employees
to
monitor
polling
places
The
decision
came
two
weeks
after
a
September
meeting
to
which
the
Civil
Rights
Division
invited
dozens
of
left-wing
activist
groups
to
discuss
voter
access
to
the
polls
Justice
has
also
failed
to
enter
the
fray
in
Ohio
As
many
as
200,000
new
voter
registrations
in
that
state
are
suspect
yet
Democratic
Secretary
of
State
Jennifer
Brunner
is
refusing
to
follow
the
2002
Help
America
Vote
Act
that
requires
her
to
verify
these
registrations
The
Ohio
Republican
Party
sued
Mrs
Brunner
but
the
Supreme
Court
said
the
GOP
lacked
standing
Justice
does
have
standing
it
is
charged
with
upholding
that
law
but
has
ignored
the
fight
The
Justice
excuse
is
that
it
isn't
appropriate
to
file
litigation
so
close
to
Election
Day
Yet
that
hasn't
stopped
the
Civil
Rights
Division
this
month
from
filing
a
lawsuit
against
Waller
County
Texas
to
correct
alleged
violations
of
the
Voting
Rights
Act
a
lawsuit
against
Vermont
for
failing
to
report
accurately
on
overseas
ballots
and
an
amicus
brief
in
a
case
filed
by
a
civil-rights
group
that
is
suing
to
stop
the
Georgia
Secretary
of
State
from
complying
with
voter
verification
rules
Justice's
election
suits
always
seem
to
side
with
liberal
priorities
It
doesn't
help
Justice's
credibility
that
attorneys
charged
with
supervising
voting
issues
are
avowed
Barack
Obama
supporters
According
to
Federal
Election
Commission
data
James
Walsh
an
attorney
in
the
Civil
Rights
Division
has
donated
at
least
300
to
Mr
Obama
His
boss
Mark
Kappelhoff
has
given
2,250
nearly
the
maximum
John

A
small
personal
note
from
a
quiet
Australian
Sunday
morning
I
gather
that
for
most
employed
people
the
financial
crisis
has
had
negligible
effects
I
am
however
one
of
the
investor
class
As
a
retired
man
I
live
almost
entirely
on
the
proceeds
of
my
stockmarket
investments
And
about
half
of
those
investments
are
in
Australian
bank
stocks
So
I
am
in
big
trouble
right
Not
at
all
One
reason
why
I
invested
heavily
in
banks
was
that
Australian
banks
had
big
meltdowns
at
the
time
of
the
Hawke/Keating
deregulation
a
couple
of
decades
ago
Most
of
the
State
banks
went
broke
and
even
Westpac
then
the
biggest
bank
tottered
a
bit
And
that
all
happened
because
of
incautious
lending
to
the
entrepreneurs
of
the
day
So
I
figured
that
the
banks
had
learned
their
lesson
and
were
not
likely
to
risk
any
recurrence
of
that
And
I
was
right
The
Australian
banks
are
in
good
shape
They
were
and
are
still
making
profits
and
sub-prime
loans
have
not
been
a
significant
problem
in
Australia
The
bank
share
prices
are
way
down
but
as
long
as
the
dividends
keep
coming
why
should
I
worry
about
that
The
new
high
is
always
higher
than
the
old
high
so
the
share
prices
will
bounce
back
in
due
course
And
September/October
is
dividend
time
so
I
have
had
a
good
cash
inflow
recently
I
like
to
keep
a
fair
bit
of
cash
on
hand
to
fund
the
various
gifts
and
donations
that
I
give
out
from
time
to
time
My
own
needs
are
minimal
I
mostly
give
direct
to
the
intended
beneficiary
Giving
to
charitable
organizations
usually
just
supports
a
herd
of
parasites
Most
of
what
you
give
to
Big
Charity
pays
for
administration
The
only
exceptions
I
make
are
that
I
do
give
to
the
Salvation
Army
and
to
Legacy
an
organization
that
looks
after
the
wives
and
children
of
military
men
who
did
not
come
home
The
fact
that
I
have
some
army
background
is
probably
sufficient
explanation
for
the
latter
and
it
explains
a
lot
of
the
former
too
Many
old
soldiers
will
tell
you
how
good
the
Sallies
have
been
in
wartime
And
I
do
have
a
soft
spot
for
real
Christians
Even
so
I
recently
found
that
I
did
have
about
10,000
that
I
had
no
obvious
use
for
so
I
BOUGHT
SOME
MORE
SHARES
Why
everybody
is
not
doing
so
rather
escapes
me
Prices
are
very
rarely
as
low
as
they
are
at
the
moment
It
is
a
great
time
to
buy
cheap
All
of
which
in
my
view
shows
one
benefit
of
managing
your
own
money
rather
than
giving
it
to
someone
else
to
manage
I
can
ride
out
the
share
price
downturn
because
I
don't
need
to
sell
anything
But
superannuation
funds
and
the
like
are
always
having
to
sell
in
order
to
fulfill
their
obligations
to
people
who
have
reached
retiring
age
So
they
are
selling
at
a
huge
loss
which
drags
down
the
funds
available
to
everybody
on
their
books
Not
smart
So
my
recommendation
is
just
buy
blue-chip
stocks
in
your
own
name
as
a
way
of
saving
for
retirement
Journalists
hardly
even
pretend
any
more
The
traditional
media
is
playing
a
very
very
dangerous
game
With
its
readers
with
the
Constitution
and
with
its
own
fate
The
sheer
bias
in
the
print
and
television
coverage
of
this
election
campaign
is
not
just
bewildering
but
appalling
And
over
the
last
few
months
I've
found
myself
slowly
moving
from
shaking
my
head
at
the
obvious
one-sided
reporting
to
actually
shouting
at
the
screen
of
my
television
and
my
laptop
computer
But
worst
of
all
for
the
last
couple
weeks
I've
begun
for
the
first
time
in
my
adult
life
to
be
embarrassed
to
admit
what
I
do
for
a
living
A
few
days
ago
when
asked
by
a
new
acquaintance
what
I
did
for
a
living
I
replied
that
I
was
a
writer
because
I
couldn't
bring
myself
to
admit
to
a
stranger
that
I'm
a
journalist
Now
of
course
there's
always
been
bias
in
the
media
Human
beings
are
biased
so
the
work
they
do
including
reporting
is
inevitably
colored
Hell
I
can
show
you
ten
different
ways
to
color
variations
of
the
word
said
muttered
shouted
announced
reluctantly
replied
responded
etc
to
influence
the
way
a
reader
will
apprehend
exactly
the
same
quote
We
all
learn
that
in
Reporting
101
or
at
least
in
the
first
few
weeks
working
in
a
newsroom
But
what
we
are
also
supposed
to
learn
during
that
same
apprenticeship
is
to
recognize
the
dangerous
power
of
that
technique
and
many
others
and
develop
built-in
alarms
against
their
unconscious
But
even
more
important
we
are
also
supposed
to
be
taught
that
even
though
there
is
no
such
thing
as
pure
Platonic
objectivity
in
reporting
we
are
to
spend
our
careers
struggling
to
approach
that
ideal
as
closely
as
possible
That
means
constantly
challenging
our
own
prejudices
systematically
presenting
opposing
views
and
never
ever
burying
stories
that
contradict
our
own
world
views
or
challenge
people
or
institutions
we
admire
If
we
can't
achieve
Olympian
detachment
than
at
least
we
can
recognize
human
frailty
especially
in
ourselves
For
many
years
spotting
bias
in
reporting
was
a
little
parlor
game
of
mine
watching
TV
news
or
reading
a
newspaper
article
and
spotting
how
the
reporter
had
inserted
often
unconsciously
his
or
her
own
preconceptions
But
I
always
wrote
it
off
as
bad
judgment
and
lack
of
professionalism
rather
than
bad
faith
and
conscious
advocacy
Sure
being
a
child
of
the
60s
I
saw
a
lot
of
subjective
New
Journalism
and
did
a
fair
amount
of
it
myself
but
that
kind
of
writing
like
columns
and
editorials
was
supposed
to
be
segregated
from
real
reporting
and
at
least
in
mainstream
media
usually
was
The
same
was
true
for
the
emerging
blogosphere
which
by
its
very
nature
was
opinionated
and
biased
But
my
complacent
faith
in
my
peers
first
began
to
be
shaken
when
some
of
the
most
admired
journalists
in
the
country
were
exposed
as
plagiarists
or
worse
accused
of
making
up
stories
from
whole
cloth
I'd
spent
my
entire
professional
career
scrupulously
pounding
out
endless
dreary
footnotes
and
double-checking
sources
to
make
sure
that
I
never
got
accused
of
lying
or
stealing
someone
else's
work
not
out
any
native
honesty
but
out
of
fear
I'd
always
been
told
to
fake
or
steal
a
story
was
a
firing
offense
indeed
it
meant
being
blackballed
out
of
the
profession
And
yet
few
of
those
worthies
ever
seemed
to
get
fired
for
their
crimes
and
if
they
did
they
were
soon
rehired
into
an
even
more
prestigious
jobs
It
seemed
as
if
there
were
two
sets
of
rules
one
for
us
workaday
journalists
toiling
out
in
the
sticks
and
another
for
folks
who'd
managed
through
talent
or
deceit
to
make
it
to
the
national
level
But
nothing
nothing
I've
seen
has
matched
the
media
bias
on
display
in
the
current
Presidential
campaign
Republicans
are
justifiably
foaming
at
the
mouth
over
the
sheer
one-sidedness
of
the
press
coverage
of
the
two
candidates
and
their
running
mates
But
in
the
last
few
days
even
Democrats
who
have
been
gloating
over
the
pass
no
make
that
shameless
support
they've
gotten
from
the
press
are
starting
to
get
uncomfortable
as
they
realize
that
no
one
wins
in
the
long
run
when
we
don't
have
a
free
and
fair
press
I
was
one
of
the
first
people
in
the
traditional
media
to
call
for
the
firing
of
Dan
Rather
not
because
of
his
phony
story
but
because
he
refused
to
admit
his
mistake
but
bless
him
even
Gunga
Dan
thinks
the
media
is
one-sided
in
this
election
Now
don't
get
me
wrong
I'm
not
one
of
those
people
who
think
the
media
has
been
too
hard
on
say
Gov
Palin
by
rushing
reportorial
SWAT
teams
to
Alaska
to
rifle
through
her
garbage
This
is
the
Big
Leagues
and
if
she
wants
to
suit
up
and
take
the
field
then
Gov
Palin
better
be
ready
to
play
The
few
instances
where
I
think
the
press
has
gone
too
far
such
as
the
Times
reporter
talking
to
Cindy
McCain's
daughter's
MySpace
friends
can
easily
be
solved
with
a
few
newsroom
smackdowns
and
temporary
repostings
to
the
Omaha
Bureau
No
what
I
object
to
and
I
think
most
other
Americans
do
as
well
is
the
lack
of
equivalent
hardball
coverage
of
the
other
side
or
worse
actively
serving
as
attack
dogs
for
Senators
Obama
and
Biden
If
the
current
polls
are
correct
we
are
about
to
elect
as
President
of
the
United
States
a
man
who
is
essentially
a
cipher
who
has
left
almost
no
paper
trail
seems
to
have
few
friends
that
at
least
will
talk
and
has
entire
years
missing
out
of
his
biography
That
isn't
Sen
Obama's
fault
his
job
is
to
put
his
best
face
forward
No
it
is
the
traditional
media's
fault
for
it
alone
unlike
the
alternative
media
has
had
the
resources
to
cover
this
story
properly
and
has
systematically
refused
to
do
so

McCain
Versus
the
Juggernaut
We
stand
with
him
by
William
Kristol
It's
always
darkest
before
it
goes
totally
black
This
is
one
of
John
McCain's
favorite
remarks
ascribed
apocryphally
it
seems
to
Chairman
Mao
Well
with
10
days
to
go
before
the
election
it's
getting
pretty
dark
out
there
Still
we
hope
for
a
McCain-Palin
victory
for
the
sake
of
the
country
And
also
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
dejection
of
the
mainstream
media
the
incredulity
of
the
leftwing
triumphalists
and
the
humiliation
of
the
pathetically
opportunistic
conservatives
who've
been
desperately
clambering
on
board
the
Obama
juggernaut
We're
proud
to
stay
off
that
juggernaut
We're
proud
in
our
modest
way
to
stand
with
John
McCain
and
Sarah
Palin
against
it
An
Obama-Biden
administration--working
with
a
Democratic
Congress--would
mean
a
more
debilitating
nanny
state
at
home
and
a
weaker
nation
facing
our
enemies
abroad
We
of
course
have
confidence
that
the
nation
would
survive
such
an
interlude
and
we
would
even
hope
that
a
President
Obama
might
adjust
course
from
the
path
he's
advertised
especially
in
foreign
policy
But
the
risk
of
real
damage
is
great
especially
when
compared
with
the
prospect
of
a
tough-minded
center-right
McCain-Palin
administration
that
could
lead
the
country
sensibly
through
these
difficult
times
Reading
the
endorsements
of
Obama
in
the
liberal
media
should
strengthen
the
determination
of
all
believers
in
American
self-government
and
greatness
to
fight
this
election
campaign
to
the
end
Time
magazine's
Joe
Klein
tells
us
that
Obama
seems
a
grown-up
in
a
nation
that
badly
needs
some
adult
supervision
To
the
contrary
we
are
a
nation
of
adults
We
don't
need
the
supervision
of
a
conventionally
liberal
and
totally
untested
junior
senator
whose
most
impressive
lifetime
achievement
has
been
the
construction
of
an
effective
narrative
about
himself
But
wait
Obama
does
have
one
great
achievement
He's
run
a
good
campaign
The
New
York
Times
tells
us
After
nearly
two
years
of
a
grueling
and
ugly
campaign
Senator
Barack
Obama
of
Illinois
has
proved
that
he
is
the
right
choice
to
be
the
44th
president
of
the
United
States
And
how
has
he
proved
this
Mr
Obama
has
met
challenge
after
challenge
growing
as
a
leader
and
putting
real
flesh
on
his
early
promises
of
hope
and
change
The
challenges
Obama
has
met
have
been
political
and
electoral
He's
met
them
well
and
we'd
be
the
first
to
pay
tribute
to
his
disciplined
and
effective
campaign
Still
is
this
proof
of
a
capacity
to
be
president
Obama
has
run
the
most
impressive
campaign
by
a
non-incumbent
since
George
W
Bush
in
2000
and
by
a
non-incumbent
Democrat
since
Jimmy
Carter
in
1976
Do
the
Obama
acolytes
want
to
hold
up
the
Bush
or
Carter
administrations
as
models
for
the
proposition
that
a
good
campaign
translates
into
a
good
presidency
We
also
hear
a
lot
of
squeaking
from
rats
deserting
the
McCain
ship
about
Barack
Obama's
exemplary
temperament
So
what
If
he'd
had
his
way
Obama
would
have
lost
the
war
in
Iraq--with
equanimity
He
would
have
been
calm
cool
and
collected
as
U.S
interests
were
sacrificed
and
U.S
honor
besmirched
Neville
Chamberlain
also
had
a
fine
temperament
and
a
good
intellect
Joe
Biden
by
the
way
has
neither
But
he
did--much
as
he
now
wishes
people
to
forget
it--support
the
Iraq
war
These
days
he
can
barely
be
bothered
even
to
mention
Iraq
Oh
well
start
a
war
lose
a
war
Gotta
move
on
John
McCain
didn't
move
on
He
helped
to
win
the
war
In
a
fine
article
on
National
Review
Online
last
week
Byron
York
reported
on
a
moment
at
a
McCain
rally
I
just
gave
John
McCain
my
Purple
Heart
Marine
Sgt
Jack
Eubanks
told
me
a
few
minutes
after
McCain
finished
a
speech
at
a
campaign
rally
in
Woodbridge
Virginia
Saturday
I
said
I
want
to
give
this
to
you
sir
as
a
reminder
that
we
want
you
to
keep
your
promise
to
bring
us
home
in
victory
and
honor
so
it
will
mean
something
The
22-year-old
Eubanks
has
been
injured
twice
in
Iraq
He's
now
teaching
Marine
recruits
at
Quantico--and
walking
with
a
cane
York
explains
that
Eubanks
saw
remarkable
progress
in
Iraq
between
his
2005
and
2007
tours
and
is
concerned
that
it
might
all
be
for
naught
I
think
Obama's
just
going
to
pull
everyone
home
as
soon
as
he
can
despite
what's
going
on
over
there
he
told
York
I
just
don't
want
it
to
turn
into
another
Vietnam
or
worse
where
everything
we
fought
for
and
all
my
buddies
who
died
over
there
it
was
just
for
nothing
We
would
hope
that
Obama
might
be
more
responsible
with
respect
to
Iraq
as
president
than
he
was
as
senator
now
that
the
surge
he
opposed
and
derided
has
worked
But
hope
is
all
anyone
can
do
And
in
dealing
with
other
foreign
threats
he'd
more
than
likely
follow
his
natural
inclination--reflexively
liberal
post-nationalist
timid
to
a
fault

The
Big

the

of

for

Hatred
and
Politics
Politics
in
America
is
a
contact
sport
Passions
flare
and
the
rhetoric
can
get
heated
and
nasty
Political
parties
stoke
these
fires
playing
on
people's
fears
as
a
key
fund-raising
tactic
Conservative
authors
have
produced
books
with
insulting
titles
like
If
Democrats
Had
Any
Brains
They
Would
Be
Republicans
and
Liberalism
is
a
Mental
Disorder
The
political
left
counters
with
ugly
titles
like
The
I
Hate
Ann
Coulter
Bill
O'Reilly
Rush
Limbaugh
Reader
The
I
Hate
Dick
Cheney
Reader
and
The
I
Hate
George
W
Bush
Reader
It
is
ironic
yet
natural
that
the
political
left
dominates
hate
literature
The
irony
is
that
the
left
championed
hate
crimes
legislation
Having
outlawed
public
expressions
of
hatred
against
various
groups
racial
linguistic
sexual
orientation
etc
the
left
sees
nothing
hypocritical
about
fomenting
hatred
toward
people
of
a
different
political
orientation
Even
if
the
hate
authors
don't
personally
hate
Bush
et
al
people
on
the
left
must
realize
how
such
ugly
language
can
poison
susceptible
minds
While
ironic
it
is
not
surprising
that
hatred
of
political
opponents
is
so
virulent
on
the
left
Hatred
has
long
been
a
central
pillar
of
leftist
ideologies
premised
as
they
are
on
trampling
individual
rights
for
the
sake
of
a
collectivist
plan
Karl
Marx
boasted
that
he
was
the
greatest
hater
of
the
so-called
positive
In
1923
V.I
Lenin
chillingly
declared
to
the
Soviet
Commissars
of
Education
We
must
teach
our
children
to
hate
Hatred
is
the
basis
of
communism
In
his
tract
Left-Wing
Communism
Lenin
went
so
far
as
to
assert
that
hatred
was
the
basis
of
every
socialist
and
Communist
movement
Indeed
it
is
easy
to
see
the
thread
of
hatred
running
through
the
various
illiberal
regimes
of
history
whether
Soviet
or
Chinese
communism
or
Hitler's
national
socialism
Only
hatred
could
explain
the
willingness
to
kill
enslave
and
rob
vast
numbers
of
innocent
human
beings
Hatred
corrodes
one's
conscience
Under
its
toxic
influence
a
person
will
regard
man's
God-given
right
to
be
secure
in
his
life
liberty
and
property
as
nuisances
to
be
overcome
not
commandments
to
be
obeyed
The
flip
side
of
hatred
is
an
inflated
self-love
self-importance
and
self-righteousness
so
extreme
that
respect
for
other
human
beings
diminishes
and
in
extreme
cases
Stalin
Mao
Castro
Kim
et
al
disappears
An
incident
recounted
in
the
late
Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's
The
Gulag
Archipelago
illustrates
this
mental
deformity
see
Thank
You
Alexander
Solzhenitsyn
Soviet
officials
wanted
to
transport
heavier
loads
of
steel
by
railroad
When
railroad
engineers
said
that
heavier
loads
would
break
down
the
tracks
they
were
shot
as
saboteurs
of
progress
When
the
loads
were
then
increased
the
tracks
indeed
broke
down
Political
goals
could
not
nullify
the
principles
of
engineering
A
leftist
conceit
is
that
will-power
can
change
the
way
the
world
works
It
can't
This
mad
tendency
persists
today
signs
of
it
are
all
around
A
recent
letter
to
the
editor
angrily
insisted
that
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
didn't
cause
high
gasoline
prices
but
that
what
else
evil
oil
companies
did
The
writer
then
vilified
Americans
for
using
too
much
gasoline
thereby
contradicting
his
earlier
statement
that
demand
was
irrelevant
So
full
of
hatred
is
this
writer
that
he
spews
contempt
for
economic
laws
In
his
arrogant
egotism
he
blames
the
world's
problems
on
the
fact
that
millions
of
people
make
choices
that
he-who
fancies
himself
more
enlightened
and
morally
superior
to
his
fellows-thinks
they
shouldn't
make
Welcome
to
the
soul
of
leftism/illiberalism
Hatred
of
individuals
for
ideological
reasons
is
pathetic
to
behold
After
conservative
journalist
Tony
Snow
passed
on
from
a
horrible
disease
see
Tony
Snow
Defender
of
the
President
and
the
Faith
posters
on
the
leftwing
blog
Daily
Kos
wrote
rest
in
hell
and
I
hope
there
really
is
a
hell
and
Snow]'s
burning
in
it
now
How
tragically
self-demeaning
such
hatred
is
It
is
a
great
sickness
of
spirit
More
recently
Gov
Sarah
Palin
has
been
the
object
of
vicious
vituperation
and
seething
hatred
like
the
threat
by
comedienne
Sandra
Bernhard
that
Palin
would
be
gang-raped
if
she
campaigns
in
New
York
City
Perhaps
her
female
attackers
feel
rebuked
by
her
decision
to
choose
life
for
babies
Perhaps
they
feel
inadequate
by
comparison
When
I
see
their
contorted
faces
and
hear
the
desperate
unhappiness
in
their
voices
I
feel
sorry
for
them
and
pray
that
the
venom
might
leave
their
hearts

Voter
fraud
last
time
The
problem
of
voter
fraud
today
is
thoroughly
revealed
in
a
recent
book
by
Wall
Street
Journal
columnist
John
Fund
Stealing
Elections
How
Voter
Fraud
Threatens
Our
Democracy
Encounter
Books
One
of
the
best
features
of
that
book
is
that
it
reveals
what
really
happened
in
Florida
in
2000
The
Democrats
tried
to
steal
the
election
for
Gore
but
failed
On
the
day
after
the
election
Bush
was
declared
the
winner
in
Florida
by
1,784
votes
Gore
kept
demanding
broader
and
broader
recounts
which
were
conducted
in
heavily
Democrat
counties
mostly
by
Democrat
party
officials
Bush's
margin
kept
declining
but
he
kept
winning
the
recounts
by
hundreds
of
votes
Finally
Gore
won
a
decision
by
the
notoriously
liberal
fiction
writers
on
the
Florida
Supreme
Court
who
began
rewriting
Florida
election
law
to
require
a
new
statewide
hand
recount
without
clear
uniform
standards
for
each
county
Both
because
the
state
court
was
changing
the
election
rules
as
specified
by
the
legislature
and
because
the
counties
would
do
the
recount
without
uniform
statewide
standards
the
U.S
Supreme
Court
held
that
the
mandated
recount
violated
the
Constitution's
Equal
Protection
Clause
With
the
recounts
ended
the
Florida
Secretary
of
State
declared
Bush
the
final
winner
by
537
votes
After
all
the
shouting
was
over
a
consortium
of
major
news
organizations
conducted
their
own
thorough
Florida
recount
Despite
well-developed
Democrat
mythology
supported
by
an
idiotically
irresponsible
HBO
movie
on
the
controversy
the
New
York
Times
reported
the
results
as
follows
A
comprehensive
review
of
the
uncounted
Florida
ballots
from
last
year's
presidential
election
reveals
that
George
W
Bush
would
have
won
even
if
the
U.S
Supreme
Court
had
allowed
the
statewide
manual
recount
of
the
votes
that
the
Florida
Supreme
Court
had
ordered
to
go
forward
But
Fund
shows
that
only
widespread
Democrat
vote
fraud
made
the
election
as
close
as
it
was
The
highly
liberal
Palm
Beach
Post
conducted
an
investigation
concluding
that
the
county
had
illegally
allowed
5,600
convicted
felons
to
vote
Felons
of
course
vote
overwhelmingly
for
Democrats
apparently
seeing
them
as
soul
mates
By
contrast
Democrat
lawyers
won
a
motion
to
disqualify
1,420
military
ballots
because
they
didn't
have
a
foreign
postmark
which
most
likely
resulted
because
the
ballots
were
sent
back
through
the
U.S
military
rather
than
foreign
post
offices
Those
serving
in
the
U.S
armed
forces
overwhelmingly
vote
Republican
The
national
TV
networks
declared
that
Florida's
polls
were
closed
at
7
p.m
Eastern
time
even
though
the
polls
in
the
heavily
Republican
Florida
panhandle
were
still
open
for
another
hour
because
they
are
in
Central

notes
that
CBS
broadcast
33
erroneous

between
7

8

that
Florida's

NBC

Most

Fund
conducts
a
detailed
analysis
of
Palm

election
return
anomalies
buttressed
by
local
interviews
to
conclude
that
Bush
was
deprived
of
another
15,000
votes
through
a
little
scam
known
as
double
punching
After
the
polls
closed
Democrat
election
officials
appeared
to
have
taken
dozens
of
the
punch
hole
ballots
at
a
time
and
punched
through
the
little
box
for
Gore
on
all
of
them
using
a
nail
or
pencil
For
ballots
that
had
been
voted
for
Bush
this
would
have
resulted
in
invalid
ballots
that
appeared
to
have
been
punched
for
both
Bush
and
Gore
For
ballots
that
had
been
voted
for
Gore
this
would
have
had
no
effect
because
the
nail
or
pencil
would
have
just
pushed
through
a
box
that
had
already
been
punched
out
for
Gore
Washington
State
Fortuitously
what
Gore
was
trying
to
do
by
seeking
recount
after
recount
in
Florida
was
demonstrated
in
the
Governor's
race
in
the
state
of
Washington
in
2004
On
election
night
that
year
Republican
Dino
Rossi
had
apparently
won
the
Governor's
race
over
Democrat
Christine
Gregoire
by
3,000
votes
Washington
is
comprised
of
heavily
Democrat
Seattle
and
King
County
surrounded
by
a
sea
of
Republican
counties
Democrats
in
King
County
first
focused
on
provisional
ballots
that
were
legally
invalid
because
they
were
not
signed
or
the
signatures
did
not
match
the
voter
registration
on
record
Provisional
ballots
are
ballots
that
are
cast
because
the
voter
does
not
appear
on
the
registration
rolls
so
his
vote
is
taken
and
kept
to
be
verified
later
if
possible
Even
though
federal
law
requires
the
identity
of
such
voters
to
be
kept
private
the
Democrats
found
a
judge
who
ordered
that
the
names
and
addresses
of
these
provisional
voters
be
given
to
the
Democrat
party
so
they
could
go
to
the
residence
of
each
one
and
get
the
signatures
straightened
out
Doing
this
only
in
the
overwhelmingly
Democrat
county
but
not
the
others
obviously
would
generate
a
lot
more
votes
for
the
Democrat
candidate
Fund
further
reports
how
the
process
worked
writing
Democrats
spent
the
next
three
days
knocking
on
doors
and
speed
dialing
voters..Democrat
volunteers
asked
if
voters
had
cast
ballots
for
Ms
Gregoire
If
they
say
no
we
just
tell
them
to
have
a
nice
day,'..Only
if
they
said
yes
did
the
Democrats
ask
if
they
wanted
to
make
their
ballots
valid
Gregoire
got
a
net
gain
of
400
votes
this
way
Then
just
two
days
before
the
final
vote
was
to
be
certified
King
County
announced
that
it
had
found
another
10,000
absentee
ballots
Rossi's
lead
was
soon
down
to
261
votes
That
was
enough
to
require
a
mandatory
machine
recount
of
all
votes
Fund
reports
But
in
King
County
the
recount
went
beyond
running
the
ballots
through
the
counting
machines
Officials
there
enhanced
710
votes
that
had
been
rejected
by
the
machines
in
some
cases
altering
them
with
white
out
or
filling
in
the
ovals
on
the
optical
scan
ballots
This
netted
another
219
votes
for
Gregoire
reducing
Rossi's
lead
to
42
votes
Democrats
demanded
and
won
yet
another
statewide
hand
recount
During
that
recount
heavily
Democrat
King
County
found
another
561
ballots
more
than
a
month
after
the
election
that
had
been
rejected
because
election
officials
couldn't
find
the
voter's
original
signature
in
the
registration
records
Two
days
later
they
found
another
22
ballots
hidden
in
voting
machines
that
were
already
in
storage
not
sealed
and
secured
in
any
boxes
Another
treasure
hunt
turned
up
150
more
votes
that
had
been
mistakenly
put
into
storage
Fund
reports
Meanwhile
in
the
hand
recount
officials
in
King
County
decided
they
wouldn't
automatically
reject
overvote
ballots
where
the
voter
had
mistakenly
marked
the
ballot
for
both
Rossi
and
Gregoire
These
ballots
were
forwarded
to
the
canvassing
board
which
somehow
determined
that
some
of
these
ballots
were
intended
for
the
Democrat
Fund
reports
The
vote
changes
piled
up
so
that
by
December
21
Ms
Gregoire
took
the
lead
by
eight
votes
Democrats
promptly
claimed
victory..Ms
Gregoire
was
declared
the
winner
by
129
votes
two
days
before
Christmas
She
praised
the
whole
process
as
a
model
for
the
rest
of
the
nation
and
the
world
at
large
This
is
how
democracy
has
been
suspended
in
Washington
state
for
the
last
four
years
This
is
also
what
Gore
was
trying
to
do
in
Florida
Keep
demanding
recounts
until
Democrat
party
election
officials
in
heavily
Democrat
counties
could
find
create
manufacture
or
rule
in
enough
votes
for
Gore
to
take
the
lead
Then
the
counting
would
be
over

No
Reason
For
Conservatives
To
Jump
Ship
By
CHARLES
KRAUTHAMMER
Contrarian
that
I
am
I'm
voting
for
John
McCain
I'm
not
talking
about
bucking
the
polls
or
the
media
consensus
that
it's
over
before
it's
over
I'm
talking
about
bucking
the
rush
of
wet-fingered
conservatives
leaping
to
Barack
Obama
before
they're
left
out
in
the
cold
without
a
single
state
dinner
for
the
next
four
years
I
stand
athwart
the
rush
of
conservative
ship-jumpers
of
every
stripe
neo
Ken
Adelman
moderate
Colin
Powell
genetic/ironic
Christopher
Buckley
and
socialist/atheist
Christopher
Hitchens
yelling
Stop
I
shall
have
no
part
of
this
motley
crew
I
will
go
down
with
the
McCain
ship
I'd
rather
lose
an
election
than
lose
my
bearings
First
I'll
have
no
truck
with
the
phony
case
ginned
up
to
rationalize
voting
for
the
most
liberal
and
inexperienced
presidential
nominee
in
living
memory
The
erratic
temperament
issue
for
example
As
if
McCain's
risky
and
unsuccessful
but
in
no
way
irrational
attempt
to
tactically
maneuver
his
way
through
the
economic
tsunami
that
came
crashing
down
a
month
ago
renders
unfit
for
office
a
man
who
demonstrated
the
most
admirable
equanimity
and
courage
in
the
face
of
unimaginable
pressures
as
a
prisoner
of
war
and
who
later
steadily
navigated
innumerable
challenges
and
setbacks
not
the
least
of
which
was
the
collapse
of
his
campaign
just
a
year
ago
McCain
the
erratic
is
a
cheap
Obama
talking
point
The
40-year
record
testifies
to
McCain
the
stalwart
Nor
will
I
countenance
the
dirty
campaign
pretense
The
double
standard
here
is
stunning
Obama
ran
a
scurrilous
Spanish-language
ad
falsely
associating
McCain
with
anti-Hispanic
slurs
Another
ad
falsely
claimed
McCain
supports
cutting
Social
Security
benefits
in
half
And
for
months
Democrats
insisted
that
McCain
sought
100
years
of
war
in
Iraq
McCain's
critics
are
offended
that
he
raised
the
issue
of
William
Ayers
What's
astonishing
is
that
Obama
was
himself
not
offended
by
William
Ayers
Moreover
the
most
remarkable
of
all
tactical
choices
of
this
election
season
is
the
attack
that
never
was
Out
of
extreme
and
unnecessary
conscientiousness
McCain
refused
to
raise
the
legitimate
issue
of
Obama's
most
egregious
association
with
the
race-baiting
Rev
Jeremiah
Wright
Dirty
campaigning
indeed
The
case
for
McCain
is
straightforward
The
financial
crisis
has
made
us
forget
or
just
blindly
deny
how
dangerous
the
world
out
there
is
We
have
a
generations-long
struggle
with
Islamic
jihadism
An
apocalyptic
soon-to-be-nuclear
Iran
A
nuclear-armed
Pakistan
in
danger
of
fragmentation
A
rising
Russia
pushing
the
limits
of
revanchism
Plus
the
sure-to-come
Falklands-like
surprise
popping
out
of
nowhere
Who
do
you
want
answering
that
phone
at
3
a.m
A
man
who's
been
cramming
on
these
issues
for
the
last
year
who's
never
had
to
make
an
executive
decision
affecting
so
much
as
a
city
let
alone
the
world
A
foreign
policy
novice
instinctively
inclined
to
the
flabbiest
most
vaporous
multilateralism
e.g
the
Berlin
Wall
came
down
because
of
a
world
that
stands
as
one
and
who
refers
to
the
most
deliberate
act
of
war
since
Pearl
Harbor
as
the
tragedy
of
9/11
a
term
more
appropriate
for
a
bus
accident
Or
do
you
want
a
man
who
is
the
most
prepared
most
knowledgeable
most
serious
foreign
policy
thinker
in
the
United
States
Senate
A
man
who
not
only
has
the
best
instincts
but
has
the
honor
and
the
courage
to
yes
put
country
first
as
when
he
carried
the
lonely
fight
for
the
surge
that
turned
Iraq
from
catastrophic
defeat
into
achievable
strategic
victory
There's
just
no
comparison
Obama's
own
running
mate
warned
this
week
that
Obama's
youth
and
inexperience
will
invite
a
crisis
indeed
a
crisis
generated
precisely
to
test
him
Can
you
be
serious
about
national
security
and
vote
on
Nov
4
to
invite
that
test
And
how
will
he
pass
it
Well
how
has
he
fared
on
the
only
two
significant
foreign
policy
tests
he
has
faced
since
he's
been
in
the
Senate
The
first
was
the
surge
Obama
failed
spectacularly
He
not
only
opposed
it
He
tried
to
denigrate
it
stop
it
and
finally
deny
its
success
The
second
test
was
Georgia
to
which
Obama
responded
instinctively
with
evenhanded
moral
equivalence
urging
restraint
on
both
sides
McCain
did
not
have
to
consult
his
advisers
to
instantly
identify
the
aggressor
Today's
economic
crisis
like
every
other
in
our
history
will
in
time
pass
But
the
barbarians
will
still
be
at
the
gates
Whom
do
you
want
on
the
parapet
I'm
for
the
guy
who
can
tell
the
lion
from
the

supports
what

CBS

Dana

that

carrier
in

feels
threatened
The
U.S
Post
Office
seems
to
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
blocks
in
the
country
People
who
live
on
it
say
they
haven't
gotten
any
mail
delivered
to
their

in
almost
two
weeks
Venus
Jones
is
one
of
them
Between
robberies
and
shootings
and

response
several
things
going

would
make
it
unsafe
said
Harvey

Venus
Jones
One
of
those
shootings
on
the
morning
of
October
10th
reportedly
happened
yards
away
from
the
mail
carrier
That's
when
the
mail
stopped
on
Marshfield
between
151st
and
152nd
streets
but
the
post
office
didn't
tell
anyone
Some

didn't
even
know
that
it

Jones

Obama's
mother
Follow-up
to
my
outrageous
post
yesterday
about
Obama's
mother
is
in
two
different
posts
on
OBAMA
WATCH
and
TONGUE-TIED
Some
practical
socialism
Today
on
my
way
to
lunch
I
passed
a
homeless
guy
with
a
sign
the
read
Vote
Obama
I
need
the
money
I
laughed
Once
in
the
restaurant
my
server
had
on
a
Obama
08
tie
again
I
laughed--just
imagine
the
coincidence
When
the
bill
came
I
decided
not
to
tip
the
server
and
explained
to
him
that
I
was
exploring
the
Obama
redistribution
of
wealth
concept
He
stood
there
in
disbelief
while
I
told
him
that
I
was
going
to
redistribute
his
tip
to
someone
who
I
deemed
more
in
need
the
homeless
guy
outside
The

the

that
I
gave

though
the

deserved
money

guess
redistribution

Why
do
they
hate
Sarah
Palin
The
abuse
being
heaped
on
Sarah
Palin
is
such
a
cheap
shot
The
complaint
against
the
Alaska
governor
at
its
most
basic
is
that
she
doesn't
qualify
for
admission
to
the
national
political
fraternity
Boy
that's
rich
Behold
the
shabby
frat
house
that
says
it's
above
her
pay
grade
Congress
has
the
lowest
approval
rating
ever
registered
in
the
history
of
polling
12
She
isn't
the
reason
polls
are
showing
people
want
the
entire
Congress
fired
with
many
telling
pollsters
they
themselves
could
do
a
better
job
Presidential
candidates
such
as
John
McCain
and
Barack
Obama
have
become
untethered
from
the
discipline
of
party
institutions
largely
because
the
parties
have
lost
coherence
So
we
get
celebrity
candidates
made
famous
fundable
and
electable
by
dint
of
their
access
to
the
Beltway
media
For
voters
this
election
is
a
national
Hail
Mary
For
nearly
two
years
all
the
major
candidates
have
rotated
through
our
lives
as
solitary
personalities
attended
by
careerist
campaign
professionals
Barack
Hillary
Rudy
Mitt
Mike
McCain
When
the
moment
arrived
to
pick
a
running
mate
input
from
the
parties
was
minimal
That
famous
party
boss
Caroline
Kennedy
advised
Barack
Obama
They
picked
a
three-decade
denizen
of
the
Senate
John
McCain's
obligation
was
himself
and
his
endless
slog
to
this
big
chance
The
quick
surge
of
party-wide
excitement
and
campaign
contributions
after
his
selection
of
Sarah
Palin
made
clear
that
the
McCain
candidacy
was
moribund
and
headed
for
a
low-turnout
debacle
If
he
had
picked
any
of
the
plain-vanilla
men
on
his
veep
short
list
Pawlenty
Sanford
Romney
or
Lieberman
they'd
have
won
approval
from
the
media's
college
of
cardinals
and
killed
his
campaign
The
stoning
of
Sarah
Palin
has
exposed
enough
cultural
fissures
in
American
politics
to
occupy
strategists
full-time
until
2012
We
now
see
there
is
a
left-to-right
elite
centered
in
New
York
Washington
Hollywood
and
Silicon
Valley
who
hand
down
judgments
of
the
nation's
mortals
from
their
perch
atop
the
Bell
Curve
It
seems
only
yesterday
that
the
most
critical
skill
in
presidential
politics
was
being
able
to
connect
to
people
in
places
like
Bronko's
bar
or
Saddleback
Church
When
Gov
Palin
showed
she
excelled
at
that
the
goal
posts
suddenly
moved
and
the
new
game
was
being
able
to
talk
the
talk
in
London
Paris
Tehran
or
Moscow
She
looks
about
a
half-step
behind
Sen
Obama
on
that
learning
curve
Lorne
Michaels
the
executive
producer
of
Saturday
Night
Live
lives
on
the
forward
wave
of
American
life
This
week
he
gave
his
view
of
Sarah
Palin
to
EW.com
I
think
Palin
will
continue
to
be
underestimated
for
a
while
I
watched
the
way
she
connected
with
people
and
she's
powerful
Her
politics
aren't
my
politics
But
you
can
see
that
she's
a
very
powerful
very
disciplined
incredibly
gracious
woman
This
was
her
first
time
out
and
she's
had
a
huge
impact
People
connect
to
her
Uh-oh
Sounds
like
the
cancer
could
be
in
remission

Those
would

the

Republicans
whose

Sarah

doesn't
just
talk
about
working-class
people
but
actually
embodies
one
and
yet
has

Naughty
Obama
Mamma
It's
amazing
what
there
is
on
the
internet
A
geneological
researcher
has
emailed
me
with
three
pictures
of
Obama's
mother
in
the
nude
That
would
be
of
trivial
interest
except
for
the
setting
in
which
the
picures
were
taken
They
were
clearly
taken
in
a
sophisticated
mid-century
apartment
and
my
correspondent
suggests
that
the
apartment
details
could
be
used
to
identify
the
photographer
He
feels
that
the
photographer
is
the
Communist
Frank
whom
Obama
mentions
as
his
mentor
That
Frank
was
so
intimate
with
Obama's
mother
would
support
the
contention
that
Frank
was
in
fact
Obama's
father
Various
bloggers
have
pointed
out
how
similar
Obama
looks
to
Frank
and
the
coverup
of
Obama's
birth
certificate
is
certainly
very
suspicious
I
will
not
post
the
pictures
here
as
Google
would
undoubtedly
take
down
this
blog
as
soon
as
I
did
Instead
I
have
posted
the
pictures
here
and
here
and
here
I
give
below
part
of
the
email
from
my
correspondent
By
pure
serendipity
I
found
a
photo
of
what
I
believe
is
Stanley
Ann
Dunham
two
more
I
found
through
sheer
plod
They
are
taken
before
Christmas
by
the
decorations
and
unopened
presents
Also
a
stereo
and
records
that
an
expert
could
confirm
as
jazz
records
are
in
view.There
is
a
distinctive
grain
to
the
wood
floors
I
do
research
including
genealogical
and
had
downloaded
everything
I
could
find
Not
much
So
when
I
saw
the
picture
I
locked
on
the
the
ear
lobes
chin
eyebrows
It
is
she
A
nude
photo,not
distasteful
but
posed
I
believe
by
a
mature
man
who
knows
what
he
likes
including
jazz
and
now
we
know
young
girls
One
could
ascertain
the
location
of
where
the
photos
were
taken
And
the
shoes..not
indigenous
to
Hawaii,but
maybe
not
unsual
for
Helen
Canfield
Chicago
socialite
and
Marshall's
second
wife
The
photos
are
important
in
the
sense
that
they
explain
the
going
to
Chicago
and
the
immediate
acceptance
by
the
hard
left
if
his
father
is
Frank
Marshall
Davis
not
just
his
mentor
McCain
Outperforming
Bush
in
Ohio
Bellwethers
I
continue
to
hear
from
my
source
on
the
ground
in
Ohio
who
is
seeing
results
for
McCain
that
are
surprisingly
good
He
puts
it
in
a
key
bellweather
section
of
Ohio
McCain
continues
to
show
internals
that
are
exceeding
the
national
pollsters
results
This
portends
a
potentially
larger
McCain
victory
in
Ohio
than
Bush
had
in
2004
As
for
those
national
pollsters
note
that
Fox
News/Rasmussen
puts
McCain
up
2
NBC/Mason-Dixon
puts
McCain
up
1
and
Rasmussen
had
it
a
tie
last
week
My
guy
on
the
ground
thinks
this
might
mean
that
the
internal
polling
is
a
leading
indicator
and
he's
noting
that
if
McCain
does
as
well
among
the
key
demographics
in
neighboring
Pennsylvania
as
he
is
in
Ohio
then
the
Democrats
ought
to
be
sweating
about
that
state
That's
far
from
a
given
of
course
Pennsylvania
is
a
bluer
state
than
Ohio
I
don't
know
that
McCain
will
win
Pennsylvania
but
it
isn't
like
he
hasn't
been
given
enough
material
spread
the
wealth
around
no
coal
plants
Murtha
alternately
calling
his
constituents
racists
and
rednecks
the
bitter
small-town
clinger
comment
etc
I
can
hear
it
now
Jim
Jim
what
about
the
Suffolk
Poll
showing
McCain
losing
Ohio
by
9
Well
if
the
Ohio
electorate
on
Nov
4
really
does
turn
out
to
be
54
percent
women
and
46
percent
men
and
45
percent
Democrat
and
31
percent
Republican
then
that
may
very
well
be
the
result
But
I
would
be
curious
about
which
debilitating
virus
is
attacking
those
with
Y
chromosomes
in
that
state
Having
said
that
the
2004
exit
poll
put
the
gender
split
at
53-47
in
favor
of
women

There
Will

No
Righting
Voting
Wrongs
in
Ohio
Reporting
in
the
DC
Examiner
today
Quin
Hilyer
reports
that
there
will
be
no
righting
voting
wrongs
in

in
part
because
of
the
fact
that
Department
of

lawyers

not
Instead
they're
in
the
tank
for
Barack

The
kicker
The
DOJ
attorney
on
the
case
former
Ted
Kennedy-affiliated
lawyer
James
Walsh
is
a
contributor
to
the
Obama
campaign
as
is
his
boss
former
ACLU
attorney
Mark
Kappelhoff
In
all
DOJ
lawyers
and
staff
in
the
metro
area
have
donated
at
least
150,000
to
Obama
No
wonder
they
seem
more
interested
in
prosecuting
those
who
warn
against
vote
fraud
than
enforcing
vote-fraud
laws
This
disconcerting
news
comes
four
days
after
I
published
a
post
Supreme
Court
Confirms
It
The
Fix
Is
In
about
the
high
court's
decision
to
allow
Ohio's
Secretary
of
State
Jennifer
Brunner
a
Democrat
to
ignore
the
temporary
restraining
order
issued
by
the
United
States
District
Court
for
the
Southern
District
of
Ohio
that
ordered
her
to

Ohio's
Statewide

Registration
Database
in
compliance
with
Section
3003
of
the
Help
America
Vote
Act
of

Now
more
than
ever
it
appears
the
fix
is
in
and
there's
nothing
within
the
law
that
anyone
can
do
about
it
until

Willie
Brown
ACORN
thinks
it
is
entitled

the

I
am
starting

15
years
as

Speaker
of

He'sa

I
hope
he

this
little
lift

The
Republicans
do
however
have
a
point
about
ACORN
and
those
voter
registration
drives
I
have
dealt
with
organizations
like
that
for
years
They
all
think
they
are
sacrosanct
and
entitled
to
play
fast
and
loose
They
see
themselves
as
advocates
of
the
deprived
and
they
are
made
up
of
a
combination
of
idealists
elements
of
the
religious
movement
and
people
like
Obama
People
who
come
out
of
college
or
law
school
and
don't
really
need
to
go
out
and
work
so
they
do
a
stint
at
community
service
ACORN
and
organizations
like
it
are
great
places
to
do
a
stint
like
that
You
use
your
skills
and
relationships
to
help
them
get
grants
In
return
groups
like
ACORN
are
unabashedly
supportive
of
those
who
help
them
especially
with
voter
registration
and
get-out-the-vote
drives
We
used
to
call
that

My
Gentile
opinion
of
antisemitism
The
Jews
are
the
best
we've
got
so
killing
them
is
killing
us
If
I
were
not
an
atheist
I
would
believe
that
God
had
a
sense
of
humour
He
gave
his
chosen
people
the
Jews
enormous
advantages
high
intelligence
and
high
drive
but
to
keep
it
fair
he
deprived
them
of
something
hugely
important
too
Political
sense
So
Jews
to
this
day
tend
very
strongly
to
be
Leftist
even
though
the
chief
source
of
antisemitism
for
roughly
the
last
200
years
has
been
the
political
Left
Why
should
the
German
be
interested
in
the
liberation
of
the
Jew
if
the
Jew
is
not
interested
in
the
liberation
of
the
German
We
recognize
in
Judaism
therefore
a
general
anti-social
element
of
the
present
time
In
the
final
analysis
the
emancipation
of
the
Jews
is
the
emancipation
of
mankind
from
Judaism
Indeed
in
North
America
the
practical
domination
of
Judaism
over
the
Christian
world
has
achieved
as
its
unambiguous
and
normal
expression
that
the
preaching
of
the
Gospel
itself
and
the
Christian
ministry
have
become
articles
of
trade
Money
is
the

For
roughly
two
centuries
now
antisemitism
has
throughout
the
Western
world
been
principally
associated
with
Leftism
including
the
socialist
Hitler
as
it
is
to
this
day
See
here
Who
said
this
in
1968
I
am
not
and
never
have
been
a
man
of
the
right
My
position
was
on
the
Left
and
is
now
in
the
centre
of
politics
It
was
Sir
Oswald
Mosley
founder
and
leader
of
the
British
Union
of
Fascists
Leftists
hate
the
world
around
them
and
want
to
change
it
Conservatives
just
want
to
be
left
alone
The
Leftist
hunger
for
change
leads
to
a
hunger
for
control
over
other
people
And
they
will
do
and
say
anything
to
get
that
control
Power
at
any
price
They
are
mostly
self-aggrandizing
crooks
who
gain
power
by
deceiving
the
uninformed
with
snake-oil
promises
power
which
they
invariably
use
to
destroy
Destruction
is
all
that
they
are
good
at
Destruction
is
what
haters
do
Because
of
their
need
to
be
different
from
the
mainstream
Leftists
are
very
good
at
pretending
that
sow's
ears
are
silk
purses
The
large
number
of
rich
Leftists
shows
that
it
is
not
material
envy
that
drives
them
but
rather
HATRED
of
society's
existing
arrangements
Leftists
don't
have
principles
How
can
they
when
there
is
no
such
thing
as
right
and
wrong
All
they
have
is
postures
pretend-principles
that
can
be
changed
as
easily
as
one
changes
one's
shirt
The
naive
scholar
who
searches
for
a
consistent
Leftist
program
will
not
find
it
What
there
is
consists
only
in
the
negation
of
the
present
The
book
The
authoritarian
personality
authored
by
T.W
Adorno
et
al
in
1950
has
been
massively
popular
among
psychologists
It
claims
that
a
set
of
ideas
that
were
popular
in
the
Progressive"-dominated
America
of
the
prewar
era
were
authoritarian
Leftist
regimes
always
are
authoritarian
so
that
claim
was
not
a
big
problem
What
was
quite
amazing
however
is
that
Adorno
et
al
identified
such
ideas
as
conservative
They
were
in
fact
simply
popular
ideas
of
the
day
but
ones
that
had
been
most
heavily
promoted
by
the
Left
right
up
until
the
then-recent
WWII
See
here
for
details
of
prewar
Progressive
thinking
Why
are
Leftists
always
talking
about
hate
Because
it
fills
their
own
hearts
Among
well-informed
people
Leftism
is
a
character
defect
Leftists
hate
success
in
others
which
is
why
notably
successful
societies
such
as
the
USA
and
Israel
are
hated
and
failures
such
as
the
Palestinians
can
do
no
wrong
Leftists
call
their
hatred
of
Israel
Anti-Zionism
but
Zionists
are
only
a
small
minority
in
Israel
Some
of
the
Leftist
hatred
of
Israel
is
motivated
by
old-fashioned
antisemitism
beliefs
in
Jewish
control
etc
but
most
of
it
is
just
the
regular
Leftist
hatred
of
success
in
others
And
because
the
societies
they
inhabit
do
not
give
them
the
vast
amount
of
recognition
that
their
large
but
weak
egos
need
some
of
the
most
virulent
haters
of
Israel
and
America
live
in
those
countries
So
the
hatred
is
the
product
of
pathologically
high
self-esteem
A
Leftist's
beliefs
are
all
designed
to
pander
to
his
ego
So
when
you
have
an
argument
with
a
Leftist
you
are
not
really
discussing
the
facts
You
are
threatening
his
self
esteem
Which
is
why
the
normal
Leftist
response
to
challenge
is
mere
abuse
Because
of
the
fragility
of
a
Leftist's
ego
anything
that
threatens
it
is
intolerable
and
provokes
rage
So
most
Leftist
blogs
can
be
summarized
in
one
sentence
How
DARE
anybody
question
what
I
believe
Rage
and
abuse
substitute
for
an
appeal
to
facts
and
reason
Their
threatened
egos
sometimes
drive
Leftists
into
quite
desperate
flights
from
reality
For
instance
they
often
call
Israel
an
Apartheid
state
when
it
is
in
fact
the
Arab
states
that
practice
Apartheid
witness
the
severe
restrictions
on
Christians
in
Saudi
Arabia
There
are
no
such
restrictions
in
Israel
Because
their
beliefs
serve
their
ego
rather
than
reality
Leftists
just
KNOW
what
is
good
for
us
Conservatives
need
evidence
The
steamroller
above
who
got
steamrollered
by
his
own
hubris
Spitzer
is

warning
of
how
self-destructive
a
vast
ego
can
be
and
also
of
how
destructive
of
others
it
can
be
A
lesson
in
Australian
When
an
Australian
calls
someone
a
big-noter
he
is
saying
that
the
person
is
a
chronic
and
rather
pathetic
seeker
of
admiration
as
in
someone
who
often
pulls
out
big
notes
e.g
100.00
bills
to
pay
for
things
thus
endeavouring
to
create
the
impression
that
he
is
rich
The
term
describes
the
mentality
rather
than
the
actual
behavior
with
money
and
it
aptly
describes
many
Leftists
When
they
purport
to
show
compassion
by
advocating
things
that
cost
themselves
nothing
e.g
advocating
more
taxes
on
the
rich
to
help
the
poor
an
Australian
might
say
that
the
Leftist
is
big-noting
himself
There
is
an
example
of
the
usage
here
The
term
conveys
contempt
There
is
a
wise
description
of
Australians
generally
here
Some
ancient
wisdom
for
Leftists
Be
not
righteous
overmuch
neither
make
thyself
over
wise
Why
shouldest
thou
die
before
thy
time
Ecclesiastes
7:17
Regular
readers
will
have
noticed
that
what
I
say
about
Leftists
sometimes
sounds
reminiscent
of
what
Leftists
say
about
conservatives
There
is
an
excellent
reason
for
that
Leftists
are
great
projectors
people
who
see
their
own
faults
in
others
So
a
good
first
step
in
finding
out
what
is
true
of
Leftists
is
to
look
at
what
they
say
about
conservatives
They
even
accuse
conservatives
of
projection
of
course
The
research
shows
clearly
that
one's
Left/Right
stance
is
strongly
genetically
inherited
but
nobody
knows
just
what
specifically
is
inherited
What
is
inherited
that
makes
people
Leftist
or
Rightist
There
is
any
amount
of
evidence
that
personality
traits
are
strongly
genetically
inherited
so
my
proposal
would
be
that
hard-core
Leftists
are
people
who
tend
to
let
their
emotions
run
away
with
them
and
who
are
much
more
in
need
of
praise
from
others
two
attributes
that
are
probably
related
to
one
another
Such
Leftists
may
be
an
evolutionary
leftover
from
a
more
primitive
past
People
who
mention
differences
in
black
vs
white
IQ
are
these
days
almost
universally
howled
down
and
subjected
to
the
most
extreme
abuse
I
am
a
psychometrician
however
so
I
feel
obliged
to
defend
the
scientific
truth
of
the
matter
The
average
black
adult
has
about
the
same
IQ
as
an
average
white
11-year-old
The
American
Psychological
Association
is
generally
Left-leaning
but
it
is
the
world's
most
prestigious
body
of
academic
psychologists
And
even
they
have
had
to
concede
that
sort
of
gap
one
SD
in
black
vs
white
average
IQ
11-year
olds
can
do
a
lot
of
things
but
they
also
have
their
limits
and
there
are
times
when
such
limits
need
to
be
allowed
for
Jesse
Jackson
There
is
nothing
more
painful
to
me
at
this
stage
in
my
life
than
to
walk
down
the
street
and
hear
footsteps
and
start
thinking
about
robbery
then
look
around
and
see
somebody
white
and
feel
relieved
There
ARE
important
racial
differences
Some
Jimmy
Carter
wisdom
I
think
it's
inevitable
that
there
will
be
a
lower
standard
of
living
than
what
everybody
had
always
anticipated
he
told
advisers
in
1979
there's
going
to
be
a
downward
turning
R.I.P
Augusto
Pinochet
Pinochet
deposed
a
law-defying
Marxist
President
at
the
express
and
desperate
invitation
of
the
Chilean
parliament
He
pioneered
the
free-market
reforms
which
Reagan
and
Thatcher
later
unleashed
to
world-changing
effect
That
he
used
far-Leftist
methods
to
suppress
far-Leftist
violence
is
reasonable
if
not
ideal
The
Leftist
view
that
they
should
have
a
monopoly
of
violence
and
that
others
should
follow
the
law
is
a
total
absurdity
which
shows
only
that
their
hate
overcomes
their
reason
The
term
Fascism
is
mostly
used
by
the
Left
as
a
brainless
term
of
abuse
But
when
they
do
make
a
serious
attempt
to
define
it
they
produce
very
complex
and
elaborate
defintions
e.g
here
and
here
In
fact
Fascism
is
simply
extreme
socialism
plus
nationalism
But
great
gyrations
are
needed
to
avoid
mentioning
the
first
part
of
that
recipe
of
course
Many
people
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
Some
find
it
in
the
hatreds
of
the
Left
Others
find
it
in
the
love
of
Christ
I
don't
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
at
all
I
hunger
and
thirst
after
truth
How
old-fashioned
can
you
get
Leftists
seem
to
believe
that
if
someone
like
Al
Gore
says
it
it
must
be
right
They
obviously
have
a
strong
need
for
an
authority
figure
The
fact
that
the
two
most
authoritarian
regimes
of
the
20th
century
Nazi
Germany
and
Soviet
Russia
were
socialist
is
thus
no
surprise
Leftists
often
accuse
conservatives
of
being
authoritarian
but
that
is
just
part
of
their
usual
projective
strategy
seeing
in
others
what
is
really
true
of
themselves
Postings
from
Brisbane
Australia
by
John
Ray
M.A
Ph.D
former
member
of
the
Australia-Soviet
Friendship
Society
former
anarcho-capitalist
and
former
member
of
the
British
Conservative
party
I
am
an
army
man
and
I
am
pleased
and
proud
to
say
that
I
have
worn
my
country's
uniform
Although
my
service
in
the
Australian
army
was
chiefly
noted
for
its
un-notability
I
DID
join
voluntarily
in
the
Vietnam
era
I
DID
reach
the
rank
of
Sergeant
and
I
DID
volunteer
for
a
posting
in
Vietnam
So
I
think
I
may
be
forgiven
for
saying
something
that
most
army
men
think
but
which
most
don't
say
because
they
think
it
is
too
obvious
The
profession
of
arms
is
the
noblest
profession
of
all
because
it
is
the
only
profession
where
you
offer
to
lay
down
your
life
in
performing
your
duties
Our
men
fought
so
that
people
could
say
and
think
what
they
like
but
I
myself
always
treat
military
men
with
great
respect
respect
which
in
my
view
is
simply
their
due
Two
lines
below
of
a
famous
hymn
that
would
be
incomprehensible
to
Leftists
today
honor
right
freedom
Freedom
to
agree
with
them
is
the
only
freedom
they
believe
in
First
to
fight
for
right
and
freedom
And
to
keep
our
honor
clean
It
is
of
course
the
hymn
of
the
USMC
still
today
the
relentless
warriors
that
they
always
were
The
kneejerk
response
of
the
Green/Left
to
people
who
challenge
them
is
to
say
that
the
challenger
is
in
the
pay
of
Big
Oil
Big
Business
Big
Pharma
Exxon-Mobil
The
Pioneer
Fund
or
some
other
entity
that
they
see
in
their
childish
way
as
a
boogeyman
So
I
think
it
might
be
useful
for
me
to
point
out
that
I
have
NEVER
received
one
cent
from
anybody
by
way
of
support
for
what
I
write
As
a
retired
person
I
live
entirely
on
my
own
investments
I
do
not
work
for
anybody
and
I
am
not
beholden
to
anybody
And
I
have
NO
investments
in
oil
companies
mining
companies
or
Big
Pharma
UPDATE
Despite
my
statistical
aversion
to
mining
stocks
I
have
recently
bought
a
few
shares
in
BHP
the
world's
biggest
miner
I
gather
I
run
the
grave
risk
of
becoming
a
speaker
of
famous
last
words
for
saying
this
but
I
suspect
that
BHP
is
now
so
big
as
to
be
largely
immune
from
the
risks
that
plague
most
mining
companies
I
also
know
of
no
issue
affecting
BHP
where
my
writings
would
have
any
relevance
The
Left
seem
to
have
a
visceral
hatred
of
miners
I
have
never
quite
figured
out
why
Although
I
have
been
an
atheist
for
all
my
adult
life
I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
the
single
book
which
has
influenced
me
most
is
the
New
Testament
And
my
Scripture
blog
will
show
that
I
know
whereof
I
speak
Some
might
conclude
that
I
must
therefore
be
a
very
confused
sort
of
atheist
but
I
can
assure
everyone
that
I
do
not
feel
the
least
bit
confused
The
New
Testament
is
a
lighthouse
that
has
illumined
the
thinking
of
all
sorts
of
men
and
women
and
I
am
deeply
grateful
that
it
has
shone
on
me
I
am
rather
pleased
to
report
that
I
am
a
lifelong
conservative
Out
of
intellectual
curiosity
I
did
in
my
youth
join
organizations
from
right
across
the
political
spectrum
so
I
am
certainly
not
closed-minded
and
am
very
familiar
with
the
full
spectrum
of
political
thinking
Nonetheless
I
did
not
have
to
undergo
the
lurch
from
Left
to
Right
that
so
many
people
undergo
At
age
13
I
used
my
pocket-money
to
subscribe
to
the
Reader's
Digest
the
main
conservative
organ
available
in
small
town
Australia
of
the
1950s
I
have
learnt
much
since
but
am
pleased
and
amused
to
note
that
history
has
since
confirmed
most
of
what
I
thought
at
that
early
age
Conservatism
is
in
touch
with
reality
Leftism
is
not
I
imagine
that
the
RD
are
still
sending
mailouts
to
my
1950s
address
Most
teenagers
have
sporting
and
movie
posters
on
their
bedroom
walls
At
age
14
I
had
a
map
of
Taiwan
on
my
wall
Remind
me
never
to
get
this
guy
mad
at
me
Instapundit
I
have
used
many
sites
to
post
my
writings
over
the
years
and
many
have
gone
bad
on
me
for
various
reasons
So
if
you
click
on
a
link
here
to
my
other
writings
you
may
get
a
page
not
found
response
if
the
link
was
put
up
some
time
before
the
present
All
is
not
lost
however
All
my
writings
have
been
reposted
elsewhere
If
you
do
strike
a
failed
link
just
take
the
filename
the
last
part
of
the
link
and
add
it
to
the
address
of
any
of
my
current
home
pages
and
Voila
you
should
find
the
article
concerned
It
seems
to
be
a
common
view
that
you
cannot
talk
informatively
about
a
country
unless
you
have
been
there
I
completely
reject
that
view
but
it
is
nonetheless
likely
that
some
Leftist
dimbulb
will
at
some
stage
aver
that
any
comments
I
make
about
politics
and
events
in
the
USA
should
not
be
heeded
because
I
am
an
Australian
who
has
lived
almost
all
his
life
in
Australia
I
am
reluctant
to
pander
to
such
ignorance
in
the
era
of
the
global
village
but
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
I
might
mention
that
I
have
visited
the
USA
3
times
spending
enough
time
in
Los
Angeles
and
NYC
to
get
to
know
a
fair
bit
about
those
places
at
least
I
did
however
get
outside
those
places
enough
to
realize
that
they
are
NOT
America
If
any
of
the
short
observations
above
about
Leftism
seem
wrong
note
that
they
do
not
stand
alone
The
evidence
for
them
is
set
out
at
great
length
in
my
MONOGRAPH
on
Leftism
COMMENTS
I
have
gradually
added
comments
facilities
to
all
my
blogs
The
comments
I
get
are
interesting
They
are
mostly
from
Leftists
and
most
consist
either
of
abuse
or
mere
assertions
Reasoned
arguments
backed
up
by
references
to
supporting
evidence
are
almost
unheard
of
from
Leftists
Needless
to
say
I
just
delete
such
useless
comments
