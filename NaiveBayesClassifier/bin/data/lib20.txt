there
are
a
couple
of
key
early

indicators
that
are
giving

reason
and

Early

in
Georgia
has
been
encouraging
to
the
campaign
and
helped
put
them
on
the
air
It's
not

Similar
story
in
North
Carolina
19
of
Democrats
have
never
voted
in

General
Election
before
The
campaign
believes
that
early
voting
is
going
to
be
a
predictor
of
the
turnout
on
election
day
the
electorate
who
votes
early
isn't
going
to
look
much
different
from
the
electorate
who
shows
up
on
election
day
As
a
result
they
are
modifying
their
turnout
models
You
need
very
complex
data
analytics
to
be

to

On
a
conference
call
to
give
the
state

the
race
Obama
campaign
manager
David
Plouffe
just
announced
that
the
campaign
is
going
on
the
air
in
three
additional
states
Georgia
North
Dakota
and
Arizona
The
campaign
has
organizations
on

of
those
states
and
has
seen

In

North
Dakota
the

running

Rear

ad
In
Arizona
it's

positive
closer
This
is
a
big
development
Just

morning
the
Atlanta

reported
on
the
prospect
of

in
that
state
The
latest
polls
show
the
Obama-McCain
race
to
be
neck-and-neck
one
poll
showed
McCain
ahead
by
1
point
another
had
him
up
by
5
but
yet
another
had
him
down
by
3
And
while
the
race
for
Georgiaâ€™s
15
electoral
votes
is
tight
neither
side
appears
to
be
investing
significant
cash
or
resources
to
win
it
in
the
final
days
Neither
campaign
has
announced
visits
by
the
candidates
or
their
top
surrogates
As
of
Thursday
neither
had
bought
last-minute
television
advertising
here
And
that
Matt
Towery
believes
is
a
real
mistake
for
the
Obama
campaign
If
the
Obama
campaign
goes
on
the
air
with
television
advertising
in
this
city
in
this
state
beginning
this
week
to
Election
Day
Barack
Obama
will
win
Georgia
said
Towery
the
former
Republican
state
lawmaker
and
CEO
of
Atlanta-based
InsiderAdvantage
If
he
doesnâ€™t
go
on
TV
Obama
will
lose
Georgia
Itâ€™s
that
simple.â€?If
it's
that
simple
then
the
Obama
campaign
is
making
a
very
important
move
Also
this
can
really
help
Jim
Martin
defeat
that
nasty
Saxby
Chambliss
in
the
Georgia
Senate
race
So
it's
doubly
beneficial
In
Georgia
the
Obama
campaign
has
a
strong
organization
and
according
to
Plouffe
early
vote
is
going
extremely
well

The
polls
in
Arizona
have
tightened
to
the
point
where
John
McCain
is
spending
resources
into
his
home
state
and
has
even
planned
a
campaign
stop
there
on
Monday
First
the
resources
Earlier
this
week
the
McCain
campaign
and
the
Republican
National
Committee
paid
for
negative
robo-calls
in
the
state
telling
voters
Obamaâ€™s
election
invites
a
major
international
crisis
he
will
be
unprepared
to
handle
alone.Now
the
campaign
stop
Sen
John
McCain
will
be
in
Prescott
on
election
eve
according
to
the
Yavapai
County
Republican
Party
He
plans
to
attend
the
party's
annual
Victory
Rally
at
approximately
9
p.m
Monday
on
the
historic
courthouse
plaza
The
rally
starts
at
6
p.m
and
typically
attracts
Republican
elected
officials
from
around
the
state
Presidential
candidates
don't
go

day

it's
absolutely
necessary
Bush
and
Kerry
were
still
out
in

states
stumping
on
Election
Day
in
2004
But
for
McCain
it
sounds
like
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
campaign
in
Arizona
Also
according
to
CNN
the
Obama
campaign
and
MoveOn
are
taking
Arizona
seriously
now
too
MoveOn.org
said
Thursday
it
was
launching
its
Obamacan
ad
statewide
on
broadcast
and
cable
in
response
The
ad
features
a
life-long
Republican
who
supports
Obama
The
Obama
campaign
sent
its
supporters
in
the
state
a
message
from
national
field
director
Jon
Carson
calling
for
volunteers
and
pointing
to
reports
McCain
was
struggling
in
his
own
backyard
Supporters
like
you
have
put
us
within
striking
distance
Now
it's
time
to
pull
off
what
no
one
expected
said
Carson.This
is
a
major
development
in
the
presidential
race
McCain's
state
has
become
very
competitive
But
remember
yesterday
on
the
TODAY
Show
NBC's
Chuck
Todd
said
Arizona
would
be
a
battleground
in
four
years
The
pundits
have

told
them
to
focus
on

Of

percent
its

Funny
how

This

Lazear
and

also
sought

defend
their
handling
of

so
far
responding
to
reports
in
The

that

will
be

to

briefing
Lazear
emphasized
that
the

legislation
does
not
bar
participating
banks
from
continuing
to
pay
dividends
at
current

was
quite
specific

We're

money
remains

the

here
is
not
what

what

of

by

when

That

But
losses
on

scale
do
not

A.I.G
replenished
its

of
the

ballot
measure

You
might

because

he'd
have

that's
not

according

is
a
dead
heat
in
Louisiana
with
43
of
voters
saying
they'll
vote
for

and
40
supporting
Obama
With

voting
has
already
ended
in
Louisiana
According
to
Dr
McDonald's
site
58.5
of
early
voters
were
Democrats
compared
to
28.4
Republicans
And
36.3
of
early
voters
were
African-American
which
is
several
points
higher
than
average
The
early
vote
was
double

John
has
some
good
info
on
early
voting
totals
in
the
post
below
To
monitor
early
and
absentee
voting
you
have
to
check
out
this
site
written
by
Professor
Michael
McDonald
BrownSox
at
DailyKos
has
a
great
crisp
analysis
today
too
The
McCain
campaign
is
trying
to
dismiss
the
surge
in
early
voting
by
claiming
that
most
of
those
voting
early
would
just
be
voting
anyway
In
other
words
all
the
people
showing
up
are
just
part
of
the
existing
voter
pool
which
has
been
polled
and
surveyed
extensively
But
that's
not
accurate
Professor
McDonald
dismisses
that
spin
at
least
for
Georgia
and
North
Carolina
in
an
interview
with
the
Washington
Post
One
question
is
whether
these
early
voters
are
just
people
who
ordinarily
would
have
voted
on
election
day
Republicans
have
suggested
that's
the
case
But
there
are
some
pieces
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
The
high
percentage
of
African
Americans
voting
early
in
Georgia
undercuts
the
GOP
argument
McDonald
has
compared
the
list
of
early
voters
in
North
Carolina
with
the
voter
registration
files
North
Carolina
allows
in
essence
same
day
registration
for
early
voters
What
McDonald
has
discovered
is
that
there
are
about
100,000
people
who
have
voted
early
who
were
not
previously
on
the
voter
lists
That
is
very
good
news

McDonald

A
poll
fix
from
the
morning
Today's
numbers
from
Time/CNN
Obama
leads
McCain
among
likely
voters
by
51
to
47
in
Ohio
a
four
point
margin
that
has
not
budged
since
last
week's
TIME's
survey
But
he
now
leads
McCain
52
to
45
in
Nevada
and
by
52
to
46
in
North
Carolina
margins
which
are
both
slightly
larger
than
those
reported
by
TIME
in
its
surveys
a
week
earlier
The
new
statewide
surveys
also
show
Obama
leading
McCain
in
Pennsylvania
the
key
blue
state
in
which
McCain
is
making
a
last-ditch
major
push
to
score
an
upset
by
a
comfortable
12
point
margin
of
55
to
43
But
he
still
trails
his
Republican
rival
in
McCain's
home
state
of
Arizona
by
a
seven-point
margin
of
46
to
53%.The
key
now
is
turnout
That's
all
that
matters

these
voters
to
the
polls

shows
Obama

today

poll
The

daily
tracking
poll
which
has
surveyed
likely
Pennsylvania
voters
since
late
September
shows
McCain
with
an
uphill
climb
to
victory
in
Pennsylvania
an
outcome
the
campaign
views
as
essential
to
his
chances
of
winning
the
White
House
Obama
leads
McCain
53
percent
to
42
percent
in
the
state
a
margin
that
has
remained
steady
since
the
candidates
last
debate
two
weeks
ago.Chuck
Todd
finally
found
a
Pennsylvania
poll
that
confirms
the
McCain
spin
about
Pennsylvania
Coincidentally
it
is
NBC's
poll
by
Mason-Dixon
showing
a
4-point
race
47
43
On
the
Today
Show
this
morning
Todd
also
reported
that
NBC's
poll
of
Arizona
showed
a
4
point
lead
for
McCain
48
44
According
to
Todd
that
means
Pennsylvania
is
a
winnable
for
McCain
and
a
battleground
But
Arizona
with
a
4-point
lead
for
McCain
his
home
state
where
he's
not
breaking
50
which
is
considered
deadly
for
an
incumbent
running
state-wide
at
this
point
in
the
cycle
will
be
a
battleground
state
in
four
years
Got
that
Also
CNN
did
a
report
this
morning
pondering
whether
we
can
trust
the
polls
That's
a
new
meme
among
the
political
reporters
these
days
They
obsess
over
polls
talk
about
polls
non-stop
and
spend
a
ton
of
money
on
polls
But
now
to
keep
the
suspense
they
don't
want
us
to
believe
those
polls
which
they
