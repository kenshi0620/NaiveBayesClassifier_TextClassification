When

neither

Federal
Open
Market
Committee
lowers
federal
funds
rate
50
basis
points
Federal
Reserve
Building
Washington
D.C
The
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
decided
today
to
lower
its
target
for
the
federal
funds
rate
50
basis
points
to
1
percent
The
pace
of
economic
activity
appears
to
have
slowed
markedly
owing
importantly
to
a
decline
in
consumer
expenditures
Business
equipment
spending
and
industrial
production
have
weakened
in
recent
months
and
slowing
economic
activity
in
many
foreign
economies
is
damping
the
prospects
for
U.S
exports
Moreover
the
intensification
of
financial
market
turmoil
is
likely
to
exert
additional
restraint
on
spending
partly
by
further
reducing
the
ability
of
households
and
businesses
to
obtain
credit
In
light
of
the
declines
in
the
prices
of
energy
and
other
commodities
and
the
weaker
prospects
for
economic
activity
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
moderate
in
coming
quarters
to
levels
consistent
with
price
stability
Recent
policy
actions
including
today's
rate
reduction
coordinated
interest
rate
cuts
by
central
banks
extraordinary
liquidity
measures
and
official
steps
to
strengthen
financial
systems
should
help
over
time
to
improve
credit
conditions
and
promote
a
return
to
moderate
economic
growth
Nevertheless
downside
risks
to
growth
remain
The
Committee
will
monitor
economic
and
financial
developments
carefully
and
will
act
as
needed
to
promote
sustainable
economic
growth
and
price
stability

the
FOMC

related
action
the
Board

Governors
unanimously
approved
a
50-basis-point
decrease
in
the
discount
rate

1-1/4

action
