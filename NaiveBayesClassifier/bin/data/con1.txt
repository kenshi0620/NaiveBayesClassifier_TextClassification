The
underlying
cause
of
the

was
probably
that
the

had
gotten
too
big
I
finally
got
Blogger
to
publish
through
the
expedient
of
deleting
some
very
old

But
I
won't

KC
Johnson
a
professor
of
history
at
Brooklyn
College
and
the
CUNY
Graduate
Center
asks
whether
a
de
facto
test
of
political
correctness
is
being
required
of
prospective
teachers
In
an
article
in
Higher-Ed
Views
Johnson
writes
The
program
at
my
own
institution
Brooklyn
College
exemplifies
how
application
of
NCATE's
new
approach
can
easily
be
used
to
screen
out
potential
public
school
teachers
who
hold
undesirable
political
beliefs
Brooklyn's
education
faculty
which
assumes
as
fact
that
an
education
centered
on
social
justice
prepares
the
highest
quality
of
future
teachers
recently
launched
a
pilot
initiative
to
assess
all
education
students
on
whether
they
are
knowledgeable
about
sensitive
to
and
responsive
to
issues
of
diversity
and
social
justice
as
these
influence
curriculum
and
pedagogy
school
culture
relationships
with
colleagues
and
members
of
the
school
community
and
candidates
analysis
of
student
work
and
behavior
At
the
undergraduate
level
these
high-sounding
principles
have
been
translated
into
practice
through
a
required
class
called
Language
and
Literacy
Development
in
Secondary
Education
According
to
numerous
students
the
course's
instructor
demanded
that
they
recognize
white
English
as
the
oppressors
language
Without
explanation
the
class
spent
its
session
before
Election
Day
screening
Michael
Moore's
Fahrenheit
9/11
When
several
students
complained
to
the
professor
about
the
course's
politicized
content
they
were
informed
that
their
previous
education
had
left
them
brainwashed
on
matters
relating
to
race
and
social
justice
Johnson
argues
that
a
required
commitment
to
social
justice
is
sometimes
used
as
a
proxy
to
require
a
set
of
political
beliefs
But
in
a
sense
this
requirement
only
sets
the
seal
on
a
long-term
trend
Citing
a
survey
of
1,643
faculty
members
at
183
four-year
colleges
and
universities
by
three
political
scientists
he
noted
that
the
great
majority
of
faculty
members
were
self-described
liberals
Faculty
members
in
the
study
were
asked
to
place
themselves
on
the
political
spectrum
and
72
percent
identified
as
liberal
while
only
15
percent
identified
as
conservative
with
the
remainder
in
the
middle
The
professors
were
also
asked
about
party
affiliation
and
here
the
breakdown
was
50
percent
Democrats
11
percent
Republicans
and
the
rest
independent
and
third
parties
The
study
also
broke
down
the
findings
by
academic
discipline
and
found
that
humanities
faculty
members
were
the
most
likely
81
percent
to
be
liberal
The
liberal
percentage
was
at
its
highest
in
English
literature
88
percent
followed
by
performing
arts
and
psychology
both
84
percent
fine
arts
83
percent
political
science
81
percent
Other
fields
have
more
balance
The
liberal-conservative
split
is
61-29
in
education
55-39
in
economics
53-47
in
nursing
51-19
in
engineering
and
49-39
in
business
Some
reviewers
of
Johnson's
work
sharply
disagree
One
Modern
Languages
professor
said
I
have
worked
with
many
colleagues
over
the
years
whose
political
and
religious
affiliations
remained
unknown
to
me
When
I
recommended
hiring
candidates
I
always
did
so
based
on
their
academic
credentials
Another
basically
argued
that
conservativism
is
positively
correlated
with
intellectual
inferiority
Hence
there
was
no
bias
I
think
that
a
more
thorough
and
unbiased
study
will
reveal
that
far
fewer
conservative
Christians
opt
to
pursue
academic
careers
outside
of
religiously
affiliated
schools
than
other
groups
This
as
I've
noted
previously
is
because
scholarship
in
prestigious
research
universities
IMPLIES
skepticism
questioning
challenging
assumptions
revising
traditions
and
subverting
dominant
ideologies
goals
that
the
most
conservative
scholars
and
students
resist
The
real
dispute
is
whether
or
not
this
isn't
the
way
that
it's
supposed
to
be
Just
as
the
media
must
remain
liberal
enough
to
question
and
challenge
political
authority
universities
are
in
fact
one
of
the
remaining
bastions
of
liberal
thinking
Conservative
beliefs
and
attitudes
already
dominate
the
political
religious
and
social
spheres
in
America
not
to
mention
public
school
boards
around
the
country
and
it's
quite
obvious
that
these
recent
attacks
on
liberal
academia
are
an
attempt
to
spread
that
dominant
influence
into
our
colleges
and
universities
So
let's
be
clear
on
where
and
why
the
battle
lines
are
being
drawn
Another
commentator
also
believed
that
self-selection
was
a
factor
in
creating
a
liberal-conservative
imbalance
But
he
did
not
put
it
down
to
smart
people
choosing
a
smart
career
He
argued
that
liberals
and
conservatives
diverged
in
their
job
choices
because
they
valued
different
kinds
of
careers
there
also
is
the
issue
of
the
pool
for
recruitment
Why
are
there
no
conservatives
Probably
because
conservatives
tend
to
seek
private
sector
jobs
that
pay
more
In
every
field
the
liberals
are
those
paid
the
least
In
physics
or
political
science
or
english
teaching
faculty
are
paid
significantly
less
than
those
finding
either
private
sector
jobs
or
those
in
academic
administration
So
the
pool
for
junior
faculty
is
more
liberal
because
conservatives
get
higher
paying
positions
in
the
private
sector
Inside
the
university
conservatives
become
administrators
and
again
are
paid
more
To
this
way
of
thinking
each
political
persuasion
creates
its
own
ghetto
by
self-selection
in
which
a
liberalism
is
as
unlikely
to
be
found
in
some
settings
as
conservativism
in
others
But
while
this
may
be
the
case
it
would
be
different
from
formally
requiring
a
political
point
of
view
as
a
pre-requisite
for
entering
into
a
career

George
Galloway
2
A
number
of
readers
JG
and
commenters
have
written
to
say
that
the
Senate
only
posts
prepared
statements
Therefore
under
those
terms
Galloway
will
not
have
submitted
a
statement
and
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
it
not
being
on
the
Senate
Website
and
I
apologize
for
the
dramatic
flourish
More
interestingly
commenter
Rick
Ballard
suggests
I
think
that
the
Senate
OFF
hearings
aren't
really
going
anywhere
The
Belmont
Club
post
said
Unless
the
Oil
for
Food
hearings
have
come
to
a
complete
dead
end
Coleman
and
Levin's
examination
of
Galloway
aren't
the
pointless
thrashings
of
Senators
at
a
loss
to
respond
to
the
devastating
wit
of
the
British
MP
but
tantalizing
clues
to
the
direction
they
wish
the
investigations
to
take
to
which
Rick
Ballard
said
I
rarely
disagree
with
your
analysis
but
I
see
zero
evidence
that
calling
Mr
Galloway
in
response
to
his
taunting
of
the
committee
served
any
purpose
whatsoever
Look
at
the
lead
up
to
his
appearance
and
you
see
pure
spotlight
politics
if
he
comes
the
committee
gets
ink
if
he
refuses
the
committee
gets
ink
On
top
of
that
add
the
leak
of
the
minority
report
to
the
Guardian
prior
to
its
publication
but
after
the
invitation
to
Galloway
and
all
I
see
is
Washington
politics
as
usual
To
anyone
thinking
that
the
minority
report
was
innoculation
against
charges
that
the
Senate
was
ignoring
American
misdeeds
wrt
OFF
I
would
ask
why
did
the
Dem
staff
spend
the
majority
of
128
pages
on
transactions
that
amounted
to
far
less
than
1
of
the
stolen
OFF
funds
Sen
Coleman
may
indeed
be
a
bright
and
honorable
man
but
Carl
Levin
hisses
when
he
speaks
and
can
slide
through
grass
undetected
The
Galloway/Pasqua
report
is
here
and
the
minority
report
is
here
Until
I
see
full
exploration
of
the
Strong/Desmarais/Paribas
links
by
this
committee
I'm
afraid
that
I'm
going
to
regard
it
as
a
smokescreen
Don
Kofi
is
a
sottocapo
figurehead
being
set
up
to
take
a
fall
for
Mr
Big
The
PowerCorp/Total/Final/Elf
connections
are
where
the
real
trail
leads
that
and
the
material
supplier
kick
backs
not
the
oil
surcharges
Maybe
they
are
headed
for
a
dead
end
It's
entirely
possible
that
Rick
Ballard
is
essentially
right
about
the
Senate
Committee
that
it
is
hunting
with
blanks
In
this
scenario
there
are
too
many
places
that
the
Oil
For
Food
scandal
shouldn't
go
owing
to
the
extremely
sensitive
nature
of
the
connections
so
only
low-hanging
fruit
like
Kojo
Annan
Zhirinovsky
and
George
Galloway
are
going
to
take
the
heat
Galloway
with
a
kind
of
perverted
sense
of
honor
may
have
felt
the
kind
of
outrage
a
small
timer
feels
when
being
made
to
hold
the
bag
and
lashed
out
at
the
Senate
investigation
because
he
knows
he
was
low
man
on
the
totem
It
would
be
sad
if
Rick
Ballard
were
right
though
it
is
entirely
possible
In
the
case
the
Oil
For
Food
scandal
isn't
the
road
to
justice
but
simply
a
fuzzy
glimpse
into
the
corrupt
world
of
international
politics
in
the
last
years
of
the
20th
century

George

Reader
KM
points
out
in
a
private
email
that
the
testimony
of
George
Galloway
before
the
US
Senate
has
gone
missing
According
to
VUNet
The
website
for
the
Senate
Committee
on
Homeland
Security

Affairs
has
removed
testimony
from
UK
MP
George

witness
testimonies
for

on
the
Oil

are
available
on

form
But
Galloway's
testimony
is
the
only
document
not
on

Press
representatives
for
the
Committee
had
no
comment
The
Senate
Committee
website
itself
has
these
terse
entries
here
reproduced
verbatim
which
does
not
say
that
the
testimony
has
been
removed
but
that
Mr

did
not

The
declaration
that
Mr
Galloway
did
not
submit
a
statement
is
curious
given
the
fact
that
he
spoke
for
47
minutes
before
the
Senate
a
performance
which
Christopher
Hitchens
no
admirer
of
Galloway
believed
was
a
rhetorical
humiliation
of
the
Senate
A
verbatim
transcript
of
Galloway's
testimony
together
with
a
video
record
of
the
proceedings
can
be
found
at
the
Information
Clearing
House
To
account
for
the
discrepancy
between
the
factual
existence
of
Galloway's
testimony
and
its
nonappearance
in
the
Senate
website
raises
the
possibility
that
Mr
Galloway's
oral
testimony
is
considered
distinct
from
a
written
statement
by
the
Senate
rules
or
it
has
been
expunged
from
the
record
because
it
puts
the
Senators
in
a
bad
light
But
there
is
a
third
possibility
The
really
striking
thing
about
the
Galloway's
testimony
as
transcribed
by
the
Information
Clearing
House
is
how
the
Senators
and
the
Member
of
Parliament
for
Bethnal
Green
and
Bow
were
pursuing
a
non-collision
course
Galloway
had
come
to
score
press
and
public
relations
points
at
which
by
all
accounts
he
was
successful
at
doing
But
Senator
Coleman
and
Levin
seemed
totally
uninterested
in
responding
to
Galloway's
sharp
political
jibes
It
was
almost
as
if
the
Senators
were
deaf
to
his
political
posturing
Instead
they
focused
exclusively
and
repeatedly
on
two
things
Galloway's
relationship
with
Fawaz
Zureikat
and
Tariq
Aziz
Zureikat
was
a
board
member
of
Galloway's
Mariam
foundation
who
is
also
implicated
in
the
Oil
For
Food
deals
Tariq
Aziz
was
Saddam's
vice
president
SEN
COLEMAN
If
I
can
get
back
to
Mr
Zureikat
one
more
time
Do
you
recall
a
time
when
he
specifically
when
you
had
a
conversation
with
him
about
oil
dealings
in
Iraq
GALLOWAY
I
have
already
answered
that
question
I
can
assure
you
Mr
Zureikat
never
gave
me
a
penny
from
an
oil
deal
from
a
cake
deal
from
a
bread
deal
or
from
any
deal
He
donated
money
to
our
campaign
which
we
publicly
brandished
on
all
of
our
literature
along
with
the
other
donors
to
the
campaign
SEN
COLEMAN
Again
Mr
Galloway
a
simple
question
I'm
looking
for
either
a
yes
or
no
Did
you
ever
have
a
conversation
with
Mr
Zureikat
where
he
informed
you
that
he
had
oil
dealings
with
Iraq
yes
or
no
GALLOWAY
Not
before
this
Daily

report
no
SEN
CARL
LEVIN

Thank
you
Mr
Galloway
Mr

could
you
take
a
look
at
the
Exhibit
Number
12
GALLOWAY
Yes
SEN
LEVIN
where
your
name
is
in
parenthesis
after
Mr
Zureikat's
GALLOWAY
Before
Mr
Zureikat's
if
I'm
looking
at
the
right
exhibit
SEN
LEVIN
I'm
sorry
I
was
going
to
finish
my
sentence
my
question
though
My
question
was
where
your
name
is
in
parenthesis
after
Mr
Zureikat's
company
GALLOWAY
I
apologize
Senator
SEN
LEVIN
That's
all
right
Now
that
document--assuming
it's
an
accurate
translation
of
the
document
underneath
it--would
you
you're
not
alleging
here
today
that
the
document
is
a
forgery
I
gather
GALLOWAY
Well
I
have
no
idea
Senator
if
it's
a
forgery
or
not
SEN
LEVIN
But
you're
not
alleging
GALLOWAY
I'm
saying
that
the
information
insofar
as
it
relates
to
me
is
fake
SEN
LEVIN
I
is
wrong
GALLOWAY
It's
wrong
SEN
LEVIN
But
you're
not
alleging
that
the
document
GALLOWAY
Well
I
have
no
way
of
knowing
Senator
SEN
LEVIN
That's
fine
So
you're
not
alleging
GALLOWAY
No
I
have
no
way
I
have
no
way
of
knowing
This
is
the
first
time
SEN
LEVIN
Is
it
fair
to
say
since
you
don't
know
you're
not
alleging
GALLOWAY
Well
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
seen
it
before
today
SEN
LEVIN
Is
it
fair
to
say
though
that
either
because
you've
not
seen
it
before
or
because
otherwise
you
don't
know
You're
not
alleging
the
document's
a
fake
Is
that
fair
to
say
GALLOWAY
I
haven't
had
it
in
my
possession
long
enough
to
form
a
view
about
that
SEN
LEVIN
All
right
Would
you
let
the
subcommittee
know
after
you've
had
it
in
your
possession
long
enough
whether
you
consider
the
document
a
fake
GALLOWAY
Yes
although
there
is
a
there
is
an
academic
quality
about
it
Senator
Levin
because
you
have
already
found
me
guilty
before
you
before
you
actually
allowed
me
to
come
here
and
speak
for
myself
SEN
LEVIN
Well
in
order
to
attempt
to
clear
your
name
would
you
GALLOWAY
Well
let's
be
clear
about
something
SEN
LEVIN
Well
let
me
finish
my
question
Let
me
be
clear
about
that
first
of
all
Would
you
submit
to
the
subcommittee
after
you've
had
a
chance
to
review
this
document
whether
or
not
in
your
judgment
it
is
a
forgery
Will
you
do
that
GALLOWAY
Well
if
you
will
give
me
the
original
I
mean
this
is
not
presumably
you
wrote
this
English
translation
SEN
LEVIN
Yes
and
there's
a
copy
underneath
it
of
the
GALLOWAY
Well
yes
there
is
a
copy
of
a
gray
blur
If
you'll
give
me
if
you'll
give
me
the
original
SEN
LEVIN
The
copy
of
the
original
CROSSTALK
GALLOWAY
Give
me
the
original
in
a
decipherable
way
then
of
course
I'll
SEN
LEVIN
That
would
be
fine
We
appreciate
that
GALLOWAY
Yes
It
is
clear
that
Coleman
and
Levin
were
attempting
to
pin
Galloway
down
on
what
he
knew
and
when
he
knew
it
They
were
also
attempting
to
get
him
to
categorically
declare
himself
on
the
veracity
of
the
Zureikat
document
In
the
end
Galloway
denied
talking
to
Zureikat
about
oil
deals
with
Saddam
before
it
became
a
public
issue
He
also
undertook
to
evaluate
the
veracity
of
the
document
which
named
him
in
parenthesis
admittedly
in
one
a
document
related
to
Oil
for
Food
SEN
LEVIN
I
wanted
just
to
ask
you
about
Tariq
Aziz
GALLOWAY
Yeah
SEN
LEVIN
Tariq
Aziz
You've
indicated
you
you--who
you
didn't
talk
to
and
who
you
did
talk
to
Did
you
have
conversations
with
Tariq
Aziz
about
the
award
of
oil
allocations
That's
my
question
GALLOWAY
Never
SEN
LEVIN
Thank
you
I'm
done
Thank
you
SEN
COLEMAN
Just
one
follow-up
on
the
Tariq
Aziz
question
How
often
did
you
uh
Can
you
describe
the
relation
with
Tariq
Aziz
GALLOWAY
Friendly
SEN
COLEMAN
How
often
did
you
meet
him
GALLOWAY
Many
times
SEN
COLEMAN
Can
you
give
an
estimate
of
that
GALLOWAY
No
Many
times
SEN
COLEMAN
Is
it
more
than
five
GALLOWAY
Yes
sir
SEN
COLEMAN
More
than
ten
GALLOWAY
Yes
SEN
COLEMAN
Fifteen
Around
fifteen
GALLOWAY
Well
we're
getting
nearer
but
I
haven't
counted
But
many
times
I'm
saying
to
you
Many
times
and
I'm
saying
to
you
that
I
was
friendly
with
him
SEN
COLEMAN
And
you
describe
him
as
a
very
dear
friend
GALLOWAY
I
think
you've
quoted
me
as
saying
a
dear
dear
friend
I
don't
often
use
the
double
adjective
but
SEN
COLEMAN
I
was
looking
into
your
heart
on
that
GALLOWAY
but
friend
I
have
no
problem
with
Senator
just
before
you
go
on--I
do
hope
that
you'll
avail
yourself
of
this
dossier
that
I
have
produced
And
I
am
really
speaking
through
you
to
Senator
Levin
This
is
what
I
have
said
about
Saddam
Hussein
SEN
COLEMAN
Well
we'll
enter
that
into
the
record
without
objection
I
have
no
further
questions
of
the
witness
You're
excused
Mr
Galloway
GALLOWAY
Thank
you
very
much
In
the
exchange
above
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
both
Coleman
and
Levin
simply
wanted
to
enter
Galloway's
denial
of
having
discussed
Oil
for
Food
business
with
Tariq
Aziz
in
the
record
Levin
immediately
ends
his
questioning
after
eliciting
Galloway's
Never
Coleman
is
content
to
merely
establish
that
Aziz
and
Galloway
were
friends
who
had
met
many
times
before
saying
I
have
no
further
questions
of
the
witness
Unless
the
Oil
for
Food
hearings
have
come
to
a
complete
dead
end
Coleman
and
Levin's
examination
of
Galloway
aren't
the
pointless
thrashings
of
Senators
at
a
loss
to
respond
to
the
devastating
wit
of
the
British
MP
but
tantalizing
clues
to
the
direction
they
wish
the
investigations
to
take
The
question
that
must
have
been
in
Galloway's
mind
and
which
is
uppermost
in
mine
is
what
else
did
the
Senators
know
The
persons
named
by
the
Senate
investigation
so
far
Zhirinovsky
Pasqua
and
Galloway
reads
less
like
a
list
of
principals
than
a
list
of
fixers
The
truly
remarkable
thing
about
Galloway's
many
meetings
with
Tariq
Aziz
was
how
much
time
the
Iraqi
was
willing
to
devote
to
an
obscure
British
backbencher
with
no
official
power
The
unspoken
question
is
why
Saddam
should
take
the
trouble
to
bribe
Galloway
if
it
were
Galloway
who
was
being
bribed
The
Senators
were
building
a
causal
bridge
to
something
but
to
what
I
am
in
no
position
to
say
but
will
guess
that
Galloway's
testimony
and
its
disappearance
from
the
Senate
website
can
only
be
understood
in
the
context
of
what
Coleman
and
Levin
were
trying
to
achieve
My
own
sense
is
that
the
investigations
are
cautiously
nearing
far
bigger
game
than
George
Galloway
but
that
his
evidence
or
his
refusal
to
give
it
is
somehow
crucial
to
achieving
this
larger
goal
Other
pieces
of
the
puzzle
may
exist
but
there
are
two
the
public
know
about
which
may
cast
an
interesting
light
in
hindsight
on
Galloway's
words
The
first
is
contained
in
the
Volcker
Commission
files
which
investigator
Robert
Parton
turned
over
to
the
Senate
Committee
and
the
second
is
the
forthcoming
trial
of
Saddam
Hussein
and
Tariq
Aziz
George
Galloway
may
have
appeared
in
the
Senate
but
even
he
must
be
uncertain
until
the
missing
pieces
are
played
on
the
board
what
he
really
said

The
High
Hand
Glenn
Reynolds
notes
that
the
New
York
Times
coverage
of
prisoner
abuse
in
Afghanistan
may
not
really
be
about
prisoner
abuse
or
even
Afghanistan
but
about
maintaining
the
prestige
of
Newsweek
He
calls
it
circling
the
wagons
the
idea
being
to
teach
press
critics
an
object
lesson
in
how
expensive
it
is
to
humiliate
the
mass
media
by
catching
them
at
sloppy
reporting
by
flooding
the
zone
with
stories
similar
to
the
one
which
was
discredited
That
may
or
may
not
be
the
case
but
it
is
nearly
undeniable
that
the
effect
of
the
media's
coverage
of
American
misdeeds
has
been
to
make
the
slightest
infraction
against
enemy
combatants
ruinously
expensive
Not
only
the
treatment
of
the
enemy
combatants
themselves
but
their
articles
of
religious
worship
have
become
the
subject
of
such
scrutiny
that
Korans
must
handled
with
actual
gloves
in
a
ceremonial
fashion
a
fact
that
must
be
triumph
for
the
jihadi
cause
in
and
of
itself
While
nothing
is
wrong
with
ensuring
the
proper
treatment
of
enemy
prisoners
the
implicit
moral
superiority
that
has
been
accorded
America's
enemy
and
his
effects
recalls
Rudyard
Kipling's
The
Grave
of
the
Hundred
Dead
Kipling
described
how
the
19th
century
Indian
Army
maintained
the
myth
of
the
Raj
and
upheld
his
prestige
to
compensate
for
their
small
numbers
and
military
weakness
When
a
Subaltern
of
the
First
Shikaris
is
slain
in
a
jungle
ambush
his
men
know
that
they
must
teach
the
Burmans
first
and
foremost
how
blasphemous
it
was
to
hurt
one
of
the
elect
For
the
sake
of
their
masters
and
themselves
the
Shikaris
raid
the
home
village
of
the
foe
and
slay
them
to
the
last
man
And
Sniders
squibbed
no
more
for
the
Burmans
said
that
a
white
man's
head
must
be
paid
for
with
heads
five-score
Kipling's
verse
finds
its
modern
analogue
not
in
punitive
visitations
against
insurgent
strongholds
in
Afghanistan
or
Iraq
which
would
be
eagerly
reported
by
the
press
if
they
could
at
all
find
them
but
in
calls
for
the
arrest
of
the
American
President
or
the
dismissal
of
the
the
Secretary
of
Defense
for
a
handful
of
cases
of
prisoner
abuse
gleaned
from
a
global
battlefield
For
example
a
court
in
The
Hague
turned
down
a
demand
by
a
dozen
plaintiffs
who
wanted
to
force
the
Dutch
government
to
arrest
US
President
George
W
Bush
when
he
visits
the
Netherlands
Donald
Rumsfeld
has
been
repeatedly
asked
to
resign
over
widespread
prison
abuse
in
Abu
Ghraib
The
point
of
these
calls
for
lopsided
retribution
is
to
drive
home
just
how
dangerous
it
is
to
trifle
with
sacred
person
and
belief
system
of
the
enemy
It
aims
to
paralyze
anyone
who
even
contemplates
such
an
act
of
lese
majeste
The
modern
grave
of
a
hundred
dead
isn't
a
pyramid
of
skulls
over
the
tomb
of
British
Subaltern
it's
an
American
Secretary
of
Defense's
head
on
a
stake
over
a
photograph
of
a
jihadi
wearing
a
pair
of
panties
as
a
hat
It
is
front-page
calls
for
an
abject
American
apology
for
flushing
a
Koran
down
a
toilet
even
if
it
was
never
flushed
down
a
toilet
at
all
except
on
the
pages
of
Newsweek
It
is
calls
for
an
admission
of
guilt
if
only
the
mere
possibility
of
guilt
existed
And
if
that
were
not
psychological
domination
at
par
with
the
worst
the
British
Empire
could
offer
in
its
heyday
then
nothing
is
There
are
Empires
today
of
a
different
sort
but
they
maintain
the
power
by
much
the
same
means
There'll
be
some
who
say
that
toppling
Saddam
was
meant
to
be
an
object
lesson
to
the
Arab
world
If
so
it
has
sent
mixed
messages
because
it
was
never
prosecuted
with
the
kind
of
frightening
brutality
that
some
have
advocated
The
image
of
the
US
after
OIF
is
one
of
a
giant
afraid
to
hurt
or
even
give
offense
to
its
enemies
Even
in
the
battles
of
the
First
and
Second
Fallujah
there
were
always
extraordinary
efforts
to
preserve
mosques
and
similar
places
probably
to
the
glee
and
wonderment
of
the
enemy
If
the
Kevin
Sites
incident
and
the
subsequent
investigation
proved
anything
it
was
that
the
Marines
were
no
Shikaris
But
if
the
US
has
been
at
pains
to
avoid
the
image
of
ruthlessness
the
enemy
by
contrast
has
made
a
special
effort
to
magnify
his
brutality
by
attacking
mosques
beheading
women
mutilating
children
etc
often
on
camera
And
the
really
disappointing
thing
it
is
that
the
intended
intimidation
works
If
George
Galloway's
standard
response
to
his
critics
is
a
lawsuit
and
radical
Islam's
first
recourse
is
a
fatwa
then
terror's
first
answer
to
insult
is
always
the
Grave
of
a
Hundred
Dead
Intimidation
brings
them
respect
from
the
very
people
who
style
themselves
immune
to
intimidation
It
is
plain
to
the
lowliest
stringer
from
the
most
obscure
tabloid
that
to
insult
America
is
cheap
but
to
insult
the
local
militants
very
very
expensive
Kipling's
cynical
dictum
is
proven
again
and
the
lesson
not
forgotten
We
live
in
a
strange
world
where
the
Beslan
story
vanishes
in
weeks
while
Abu
Ghraib
lives
on
for
years
Maybe
it
reflects
the
inherent
importance
of
the
stories
but
it
more
probably
demonstrates
the
media's
ability
to
prolong
the
life
of
some
stories
while
ignoring
others
I
hope
it
is
not
impertinent
to
observe
that
the
media's
demeanor
towards
terrorism
bears
more
than
a
passing
resemblance
to
cheap
cowardice
but
though
outwardly
similar
it
really
springs
from
a
high-minded
idealism
deep
courage
and
profound
learning
Or
so
I
hope
The
Grave
of
a
Hundred
Dead
There's
a
widow
in
sleepy
Chester
Who
weeps
for
her
only

There's
a

A

shun
And
there's

Who
tells
how
the
work
was
done
A
Snider
squibbed
in
the
jungle
Somebody
laughed
and
fled
And
the
men
of
the
First
Shikaris
Picked
up
their
Subaltern
dead
With
a
big
blue
mark
in
his
forehead
And
the
back
blown
out
of
his
head
Subadar
Prag
Tewarri
Jemadar
Hira
Lal
Took
command
of
the
party
Twenty
rifles
in
all
Marched
them
down
to
the
river
As
the
day
was
beginning
to
fall
They
buried
the
boy
by
the
river
A
blanket
over
his
face
They
wept
for
their
dead
Lieutenant
The
men
of
an
alien
race
They
made
a
samadh
in
his
honour
A
mark
for
his
resting-place
For
they
swore
by
the
Holy
Water
They
swore
by
the
salt
they
ate
That
the
soul
of
Lieutenant
Eshmitt
Sahib
Should
go
to
his
God
in
state
With
fifty
file
of
Burmans
To
open
him
Heaven's
Gate
The
men
of
the
First
Shikaris
Marched
till
the
break
of
day
Till
they
came
to
the
rebel
village
The
village
of
Pabengmay
A
jingal
covered
the
clearing
Caltrops
hampered
the
way
Subadar
Prag
Tewarri
Bidding
them
load
with
ball
Halted
a
dozen
rifles
Under
the
village
wall
Sent
out
a
flanking-party
With
Jemadar
Hira
Lal
The
men
of
the
First
Shikaris
Shouted
and
smote
and
slew
Turning
the
grinning
jingal
On
to
the
howling
crew
The
Jemadar's
flanking-party
Butchered
the
folk
who
flew
Long
was
the
morn
of
slaughter
Long
was
the
list
of
slain
Five
score
heads
were
taken
Five
score
heads
and
twain
And
the
men
of
the
First
Shikaris
Went
back
to
their
grave
again
Each
man
bearing
a
basket
Red
as
his
palms
that
day
Red
as
the
blazing
village
The
village
of
Pabengmay
And
the
drip-drip-drip
from
the
baskets
Reddened
the
grass
by
the
way
They
made
a
pile
of
their
trophies
High
as
a
tall
man's
chin
Head
upon
head
distorted
Set
in
a
sightless
grin
Anger
and
pain
and
terror
Stamped
on
the
smoke-scorched
skin
Subadar
Prag
Tewarri
Put
the
head
of
the
Boh
On
the
top
of
the
mound
of
triumph
The
head
of
his
son
below
With
the
sword
and
the
peacock
banner
That
the
world
might
behold
and
know
Thus
the
samadh
was
perfect
Thus
was
the
lesson
plain
Of
the
wrath
of
the
First
Shikaris
The
price
of
white
man
slain
And
the
men
of
the
First
Shikaris
Went
back
into
camp
again
Then
a
silence
came
to
the
river
A
hush
fell
over
the
shore
And
Bohs
that
were
brave
departed
And
Sniders
squibbed
no
more
For
the
Burmans
said
That
a
white
man's
head
Must
be
paid
for
with
heads
five-score
There's
a
widow
in
sleepy
Chester
Who
weeps

There's

The
drama
surrounding
attempts
by
Canadian
PM
Paul
Martin
to
hang
on
to
power
by
ignoring
a
no
confidence
vote
and
then
offering
a
Conservative
oppositionist
a
Cabinet
post
to
switch
sides
has
taken
an
dramatic
turn
Conservative
Canadian
MP
Gurmant
Grewal
tape
recorded
an
attempt
by
the
Prime
Minister's
chief
of
staff
Tim
Murphy
to
bribe
him
to
change
his
vote
Andrew
Coyne
highlights
some
snippets
of
the
recorded
conversation
which
are
best
heard
against
the
background
of
squeezebox
music
playing
Speak
softly
love
so
no
one
hears
us
but
the
sky
Murphy
if
anybody
is
asked
the
question
Well
is
there
a
deal
and
you
say
No
Well
you
want
that
to
be
the
truth
So
you
didn't
approach
We
didn't
approach
A
recent
Belmont
Club
post
noted
that
victories
won
by
the
Left
with
these
tactics
were
more
properly
understood
as
acts
of
desperation
by
those
who
feared
their
long
term
decline
as
if
in
slipping
from
the
pinnacle
they
despaired
of
ever
regaining
it
again
The
survival
of
Paul
Martin's
government
shaken
by
scandal
after
scandal
has
been
bought
at
the
price
of
violating
the
spirit
of
the
Westminister
system
by
ignoring
what
was
effectively
a
vote
of
no-confidence
until
they
could
bribe
someone
to
cross
the
aisle
to
square
the
count
Martin
survived
but
only
by
bending
the
rulebook
A
Canadian
conservative
victory
without
Martin's
shennanigans
would
have
been
an
unremarkable
and
narrow
electoral
triumph
But
the
Liberal
Party
of
Canada's
actions
now
mean
that
the
issues
dividing
political
factions
in
the
Great
White
North
are
fundamental
By
demonstrating
a
determination
to
hold
on
to
power
at
all
costs
Martin
is
increasing
the
likelihood
of
a
radical
rather
than
an
incremental
solution
to
the
Canadian
crisis
Mark
Steyn
has
more
in
his
article
A
Constitutional
Coup
In
the
forthcoming
Western
Standard
I
make
the
point
that
the
big
flaw
at
the
heart
of
the
Westminster
system
is
that
in
order
to
function
as
intended
by
codes
and
conventions
it
depends
on
a
certain
modesty
and
circumspection
from
the
political
class
Perhaps
it
was
always
a
long
shot
to
expect
a
man
as
hollow
as
Paul
Martin
to
understand
that
But
the
fact
remains
by
any
understanding
of
our
system
of
government
if
the
effect
of
an
extra
week's
delay
is
to
maintain
themselves
in
power
by
one
vote
they
otherwise
would
not
have
had
it's
hard
to
see
this
as
anything
other
than
a
constitutional
coup
Like
Robert
Mugabe
Paul

is
the

The
Road
to
Perdition
Two
factors
that
are
normally
considered
in
evaluating
the
outcome
of
a
contemplated
action
are
encapsulated
in
the
notion
of
an
expected
value
An
expected
value
is
calculated
from
two
independent
components
the
probability
of
an
outcome
and
the
payoff
of
that
outcome
where
a
payoff
can
be
negative
that
is
a
loss
But
into
the
mathematics
comes
the
human
factor
expressed
in
our
risk/return
profile
People
can
choose
between
two
mathematically
equal
expected
values
depending
on
their
degree
of
risk
aversion
For
example
in
making
a
wager
one
might
be
willing
to
accept
a
large
risk
of
losing
a
small
amount
and
but
be
unwilling
to
take
a
small
risk
of
losing
a
very
large
amount
even
though
they
may
have
the
same
expected
value
That's
why
few
people
are
willing
to
play
Russian
roulette
even
for
large
sums
of
money
In
relation
to
the
Newsweek
Koran
story
fiasco
the
existence
of
a
wartime
situation
distorts
the
editorial
process
to
the
degree
that
it
increases
the
consequences
of
a
mistake
The
probability
of
making
an
editorial
mistake
may
be
the
same
as
it
was
ten
years
ago
given
the
same
standards
of
news
confirmation
but
the
consequences
of
an
error
may
have
drastically
increased
in
a
post-September
11
world
where
news
is
disseminated
to
distant
combat
zones
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
Newspapers
are
not
alone
in
facing
drastically
changed
payoff
profiles
for
traditionally
accepted
practices
By
the
standards
of
World
War
2
the
modern
US
military
has
objectively
reduced
the
probability
of
civilian
casualties
prisoner
abuse
etc
to
a
degree
that
General
Eisenhower
or
MacArthur
would
never
have
dreamed
possible
Unfortunately
the
political
consequences
of
those
events
have
grown
to
such
an
extent
that
their
increase
dominates
the
reduction
in
probability
in
the
final
product
the
expected
value
All
of
this
is
common
sense
but
it
is
easy
to
forget
when
one
is
blamed
for
doing
what
has
always
been
done
The
consequential
difference
between
Woodward's
Deep
Throat
and
Isikoff's
anonymous
source
is
not
necessarily
the
character
or
competence
of
one
over
the
other
nor
even
the
veracity
of
their
informants
It's
the
thirty
years
between
their
stories
it's
the
fact
that
there's
a
war
on
In
the
world
of
probability
times
payoff
good
intentions
are
not
a
factor
Whether
one
means
well
or
acts
maliciously
is
irrelevant
to
changing
the
practical
outcome
of
an
event
Thus
the
US
military
has
learned
it
is
not
enough
not
to
desire
reducing
collateral
damage
it
is
important
to
create
systems
and
procedures
to
achieve
this
The
small
diameter
bomb
special
targeting
software
to
reduce
the
footprint
of
blasts
training
and
many
other
programs
costing
billions
are
a
more
serous
proof
that
avoiding
civilian
casualties
is
a
priority
than
any
number
of
heartfelt
declarations
however
sincere
Because
if
the
size
of
the
payoff
has
grown
one
had
better
damn
well
lower
the
probability
to
keep
the
expected
value
constant
So
when
Newsweek
went
to
press
with
the
Koran
story
on
the
basis
of
an
anonymous
informant
and
no
confirmation
other
one
denial
from
an
official
and
the
absence
of
a
denial
from
another
it
was
not
really
doing
anything
untraditional
but
it
had
failed
to
take
into
account
the
changed
nature
of
the
world
The
US
Air
Force
could
well
have
argued
that
sending
massed
formations
of
heavy
bombers
to
carpet-bomb
the
Muslim
world
was
not
any
different
from
what
Curtis
Le
May
and
Air
Marshall
Arthur
Harris
did
during
the
Good
War
but
that
would
have
been
absurd
The
amazing
thing
is
how
long
it
took
to
understand
how
the
times
had
changed
for
the
Press
as
well
That
may
be
in
part
because
the
Press
is
spared
the
immediate
and
terrible
feedback
of
combat
to
which
the
military
is
continuously
subjected
The
military
effort
to
reduce
collateral
damage
is
driven
largely
by
self-interest
the
need
to
avoid
unnecessary
hostility
from
civilians
in
combat
zones
and
to
maintain
political
acceptability
for
its
assigned
missions
The
requirements
of
survival
have
forced
the
military
to
evolve
But
the
Press
in
holding
itself
above
responsibility
has
escaped
into
a
kind
of
Lost
World
which
is
even
now
being
shaken
by
a
cataclysm

The
Agent
2
The
Drudgereport
carried
a
report
of
this
strangely
shrill
exchange
at
a
press
briefing
between
Bush
spokesman
Scott
McClellan
and
reporters
The
words
in
the
exchange
are
important
but
not
nearly
as
significant
as
the
atmospherics
which
evoke
Edvard
Munch's
The
Scream
Q
With
respect
who
made
you
the
editor
of
Newsweek
Do
you
think
it's
appropriate
for
you
at
that
podium
speaking
with
the
authority
of
the
President
of
the
United
States
to
tell
an
American
magazine
what
they
should
print
MR
McCLELLAN
I'm
not
telling
them
I'm
saying
that
we
would
encourage
them
to
help
Q
You're
pressuring
them
MR
McCLELLAN
No
I'm
saying
that
we
would
encourage
them
Q
It's
not
pressure
MR
McCLELLAN
Look
this
report
caused
serious
damage
to
the
image
of
the
United
States
abroad
And
Newsweek
has
said
that
they
got
it
wrong
I
think
Newsweek
recognizes
the
responsibility
they
have
We
appreciate
the
step
that
they
took
by
retracting
the
story
Now
we
would
encourage
them
to
move
forward
and
do
all
that
they
can
to
help
repair
the
damage
that
has
been
done
by
this
report
And
that's
all
I'm
saying
But
no
you're
absolutely
right
it's
not
my
position
to
get
into
telling
people
what
they
can
and
cannot
report
Q
Are
you
asking
them
to
write
a
story
about
how
great
the
American
military
is
is
that
what
you're
saying
here
MR
McCLELLAN
Elisabeth
let
me
finish
my
sentence
Our
military
Q
You've
already
said
what
you're
I
know
what
how
it
ends
MR
McCLELLAN
No
I'm
coming
to
your
question
and
you're
not
letting
me
have
a
chance
to
respond
But
our
military
goes
out
of
their
way
to
handle
the
Koran
with
care
and
respect
There
are
policies
and
practices
that
are
in
place
This
report
was
wrong
Newsweek
itself
stated
that
it
was
wrong
And
so
now
I
think
it's
incumbent
and
incumbent
upon
Newsweek
to
do
their
part
to
help
repair
the
damage
And
they
can
do
that
through
ways
that
they
see
best
but
one
way
that
would
be
good
would
be
to
point
out
what
the
policies
and
practices
are
in
that
part
of
the
world
because
it's
in
that
region
where
this
report
has
been
exploited
and
used
to
cause
lasting
damage
to
the
image
of
the
United
States
of
America
It
has
had
serious
consequences
And
so
that's
all
I'm
saying
is
that
we
would
encourage
them
to
take
steps
to
help
repair
the
damage
And
I
think
that
they
recognize
the
importance
of
doing
that
That's
all
I'm
saying
Q
As
far
as
the
Newsweek
article
is
concerned
first
how
and
where
the
story
came
from
And
do
you
think
somebody
can
investigate
if
it
really
happened
at
the
base
and
who
told
Newsweek
Because
somebody
wrote
a
story
The
resentment
is
palpable
Not
the
resentment
of
the
spokesman
of
a
Commander
in
Chief
of
a
military
vilified
in
an
article
that
has
already
been
retracted
but
the
resentment
of
reporters
whose
prerogatives
have
been
questioned
With
respect
who
made
you
the
editor
of
Newsweek
one
asks
McClellan
actually
cannot
finish
a
sentence
in
answer
because
one
of
the
prerogatives
of
this
particular
reporter
is
to
ask
the
questions
You've
already
said
what
you're
I
know
what
how
it
ends
And
the
question
although
put
in
different
words
each
time
is
monomanaically
the
same
when
did
you
stop
beating
your
wife
As
far
as
the
Newsweek
article
is
concerned
first
how
and
where
the
story
came
from
And
do
you
think
somebody
can
investigate
if
it
really
happened
at
the
base

who
told
Newsweek
Because
somebody
wrote
a
story
And
because
somebody
wrote
a
story
the
presumption
was
that
the
story
had
to
be
true
the
retraction
notwithstanding
as
if
it
never
existed
as
if
the
retraction
were
completely
irrelevant
from
the
discussion
In
a
sense
it
is
because
there
was
never
a
retraction
There
may
have
been
words
which
resembled
a
retraction
but
it
was
never
ever
really
made
because
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
ever
make

Three
Weddings

Four
apparently
disconnected
events
in
the
past
few
days
have
served
as
the
bellweather
in
the
crisis
called
the
Global
War
on
Terror
a
name
now
too
narrow
to
be
apt
because
it
has
entailed
a
confrontation
not
only
between
terror
and
civilization
but
also
Muslims
and
Christians
Left
and
Right
Democracy
and
Facism
the
Old
World
and
the
New
and
much
else
The
four
events
are
the
George
Galloway
testimony
before
the
US
Senate
the
survival
through
questionable
constitutional
tactics
of
the
Liberal
Government
in
Canada
the
retraction
by
Newsweek
of
its
Koran-flushing
story
and
finally
the
events
in
Uzbekistan
The
thread
common
to
Galloway
the
manuevers
of
the
Canadian
Paul
Martin
administration
and
Newsweek
article
is
the
extent
to
which
the
once-magisterial
Left
is
now
resorting
to
the
shrillest
and
cheapest
tactics
as
defensive
maneuvers
Take
George
Galloway
His
grandstand
performance
before
the
Coleman
committee
was
brilliant
employment
of
a
weak
hand
Galloway
understood
his
weakness
on
substantive
issues
and
turned
his
testimony
into
a
screed
attempting
to
change
the
ground
of
the
debate
It
was
wonderful
theater
but
still
a
weak
hand
The
Coleman
hearings
are
about
Oil
For
Food
lost
in
the
noise
is
the
essential
fact
that
Galloway
was
a
loose
cannon
under
oath
In
his
blather
he
has
connected
some
dots
which
are
going
to
stay
connected
long
after
Galloway's
fifteen
minutes
of
media
fame
have
faded
I
think
George
Galloway
will
see
his
theatrical
performance
replayed
more
often
than
he
would
like
The
survival
of
Paul
Martin's
government
shaken
by
scandal
after
scandal
has
been
bought
at
the
price
of
violating
the
spirit
of
the
Westminister
system
by
ignoring
after
what
was
effectively
a
vote
of
no-confidence
until
they
could
bribe
someone
to
cross
the
aisle
to
square
the
count
Martin
survived
but
only
by
bending
the
rulebook
A
Canadian
conservative
victory
without
Martin's
shennanigans
would
have
been
an
unremarkable
and
narrow
electoral
triumph
But
the
Liberal
Party
of
Canada's
actions
now
mean
that
the
issues
dividing
political
factions
in
the
Great
White
North
are
fundamental
By
demonstrating
a
determination
to
hold
on
to
power
at
all
costs
Martin
is
increasing
the
likelihood
of
a
radical
rather
than
an
incremental
solution
to
the
Canadian
crisis
The
Newsweek
affair
was
in
its
way
a
demonstration
of
how
the
mighty
have
fallen
The
Koran-flushing
story
can
only
be
understood
in
the
context
of
the
media's
unexpected
failure
to
play
is
accustomed
role
in
the
shaping
the
agenda
on
the
War
on
Terror
the
debate
over
the
United
Nations
and
above
all
the
2004
elections
Watching
Newsweek
build
a
vaporous
story
and
getting
caught
out
is
like
seeing
a
once
great
prize-fighter
resorting
to
eye-gouging
headbutting
and
ear-biting
on
his
inevitable
slide
down
into
the
undercard
Like
Galloway
and
Martin
the
Newsweek
performance
is
one
of
ferocity
but
ferocity
in
decline
There
was
a
time
when
the
Left
was
represented
by
the
Jaures
and
the
Jean
Paul
Sartres
Franco
Molina
once
wrote
a
line
for
a
Para
general
in
the
Battle
of
Algiers
Why
is
it
that
the
Sartres
are
all
born
on
the
other
side
The
Left
could
afford
to
speak
down
to
its
critics
But
if
Solina
had
waited
a
few
decades
more
he
would
have
seen
them
replaced
by
George
Galloway
Michael
Moore
Robert
Fisk
and
Ward
Churchill
who
now
await
only
the
arrival
of
Bozo
the
Clown
to
become
the
Five
Amigos
The
bad
news
comes
not
from
the
headlines
but
the
backpages
in
Uzbekistan
where
it
is
possible
that
the
United
States
in
throwing
in
with
President
Karimov
has
entered
into
a
tactical
alliance
with
a
tyrant
against
radical
Islamism
making
him
an
ally
yes
but
a
tyrant
just
the
same
Dan
Darling
at
Winds
of
Change
lays
the
case
out
dispassionately
for
his
quondam
utility
and
possible
future
liability
Karimov
runs
an
exceedingly
tight
and
draconian
ship
but
until
quite
recently
the
majority
of
the
population
was
hesitant
about
standing
up
to
him
either
because
they
thought
that
he
may
be
a
tyrant
and
a
strongman
but
that
in
so
doing
he
held
the
country
together
and
prevented
it
from
descending
into
chaos
This
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
protest/rebellion
regardless
of
the
cause
is
such
a
significant
development
it
means
that
for
a
growing
number
of
Uzbeks
the
view
of
Karimov
as
being
a
necessary
evil
has
now
weakened
to
the
point
where
large
numbers
of
them
are
able
to
protest
or
even
take
up
arms
against
his
government
with
the
latter
in
particular
being
a
pretty
big
indication
that
somebody
in
Uzbekistan
thinks
they
have
a
chance
of
bringing
down
his
regime
The
willingness
to
stand
up
to
Karimov
the
fact
that
these
protests
are
even
occurring
is
a
sign
of
the
impotency
of
his
fearsome
police
state
is
probably
a
good
thing
in
the
long
run
in
the
sense
of
eventually
producing
a
stable
democracy
in
the
country
On
the
flip
side
it
also
provides
some
definite
windows
of
opportunity
for
Hizb-ut-Tahrir
and
the
IMU
to
exploit
if
they
can
move
quickly
since
both
groups
have
been
at
the
forefront
of
visible
opposition
to
the
regime
This
survey
of
events
suggests
and
it
just
my
opinion
that
the
real
strategic
danger
to
the
cause
of
freedom
and
democracy
isn't
from
the
noisemakers
of
the
Left
but
from
the
temptation
to
betray
principles
for
tactical
gain
It
lies
on
the
very
same
path
that
Galloway
Martin
and
Newsweek
in
their
cunning
have
taken
The
Left
hitched
its
wagon
to
the
worst
men
of
the
20th
and
21st
century

it
is
dragging
them
into
the

The
Agent
The
Agency
Problem
arises
when
a
conflict
of
interest
arises
between
a
principal
and
his
agent
The
press
often
represents
itself
as
an
agent
of
the
larger
society
a
seeker
after
the
truth
on
behalf
of
the
public
It
is
perfectly
legitimate
to
ask
whether
a
conflict
of
interest
can
arise
between
the
media
and
the
public
A
moment's
reflection
is
enough
to
establish
it
is
not
always
the
case
that
the
press
whether
a
newspaper
or
an
individual
blogger
has
interests
which
completely
coincide
with
the
general
public
because
any
media
entity
is
a
proper
subset
of
the
public
being
a
part
it
cannot
be
the
whole
In
the
case
of
the
Newsweek
decision
to
print
a
poorly
sourced
story
on
the
descreation
of
a
Koran
at
Guantanamo
Naval
Base
it
is
pertinent
to
ask
how
the
costs
and
benefits
of
the
magazine's
action
would
be
distributed
whether
the
interests
of
the
agent
substantially
coincide
with
the
principal
the
public
in
whose
name
the
press
often
claims
to
act
But
any
boost
in
circulation
would
accrue
benefits
to
the
employees
and
stockholders
of
Newsweek
and
not
to
general
members
of
the
public
unless
they
had
shares
It
is
equally
clear
that
any
externalities
arising
from
the
Koran
story
would
not
normally
be
borne
by
Newsweek
Though
people
might
die
places
destroyed
or
riots
occur
they
would
not
likely
happen
to
people
or
places
associated
with
Newsweek
The
fallacy
in
the
argument
of
course
is
the
premise
that
Newsweek
acts
as
an
agent
for
the
general
public
It
isn't
and
is
free
from
any
responsibility
as
a
public
agent
in
the
uproar
it
has
caused
by
its
retracted
story
Newsweek
is
not
an
agent
but
the
purveyor
of
a
product
for
which
there
happens
to
be
a
market
protected
by
the
First
Amendment
This
should
be
clear
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
But
the
question
arises
to
what
extent
is
a
commercial
organization
free
to
dump
the
external
costs
of
their
business
on
others
For
historical
and
political
reasons
society
has
been
reluctant
to
make
the
purveyors
of
this
sort
of
information
accountable
for
the
full
cost
of
their
speech
reasoning
it
would
be
better
for
society
the
Commons
to
bear
the
externality
than
to
risk
restricting
expression
As
in
any
case
where
an
economic
actor
does
not
bear
the
entire
cost
of
its
actions
there
is
a
tendency
to
overexploit
the
capacity
of
the
Commons
to
privately
appropriate
the
gains
and
leave
the
effluent
on
the
village
green
to
be
swept
up
by
everyone
else
In
this
specific
case
it
is
possible
to
entirely
dispose
of
the
argument
that
responsbility
is
somehow
the
Bush
Adminstration's
because
Newsweek
itself
has
retracted
the
Koran
story
Whatever
else
the
Bush
Administration
may
be
guilty
of
it
is
not
guilty
in
this
particular
case
but
since
Newsweek
will
not
bear
the
costs
of
its
mistake
because
it
is
under
no
agency
obligation
to
do
so
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
costs
must
be
borne
by
someone
else
in
this
particular
case
also
by
the
Commons
in
this
instance
largely
by
the
elected
agents
of
the
public
i.e
the
government
and
its
representatives
that
is
by
someone
in
Afghanistan
or
Iraq
The
interesting
question
is
what
should
prevent
this
from
happening
again
and
the
answer
insofar
as
I
can
see
is
nothing
The
system
works
that
way
by
design
choice
One
thing
that
may
create
pressure
for
change
is
the
increasing
cost
of
dumping
such
externalities
onto
the
Commons
In
a
world
where
certain
groups
are
likely
to
detonate
car
bombs
or
radiological
devices
in
response
to
any
real
or
imagined
slight
the
Commons
may
be
unable
to
bear
the
external
costs
of
news
organizations
mindlessly
purveying
inflammatory
and
poorly-sourced
news
products
That
is
essentially
the
argument
for
censorship
in
wartime
Yet
censorship
itself
imposes
such
huge
costs
that
it
is
questionable
whether
such
a
cure
would
be
better
than
the
disease
In
the
past
the
choice
of
evils
was
avoided
by
resorting
to
social
pressure
like
appeals
to
patriotism
or
personal
requests
A
newsmagazine
in
1944
would
probably
not
even
considered
publishing
the
equivalent
of
the
Koran
story
on
the
basis
of
the
slightest
of
sources
and
without
any
collateral
confirmation
whatsoever
But
we're
not
in
Kansas
any
more
Without
that
self
restraint
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
for
the
Commons
to
keep
bearing
the
full
cost
of
Newsweek-type
journalism
until
the
system
snaps
to
the
detriment
of
all
