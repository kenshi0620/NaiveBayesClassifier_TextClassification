Thriller

won

Given
that

basically
put
MTV
on
the
map
no
wonder
A

writes
When
the
video
premiered
in
1983
Jackson
effectively
transformed
the
role
of
music
videos
in
an
artist's
career
After
the
14-minute
video
premiered
in
December
MTV
began
running
it
twice
per
hour
due
to
the
high
demand
from
viewers
The
video
has
heavily
influenced
pop
culture
around
the
world
in
other

Of
The
Day
Should
the
Court
have
waited
for
Southern
voters
to
fall
in
line
before
overturning
Plessy
And
54
years
later
after
the
Brown
v
Board
Of
Education
decision
outlawing
school
segregation
should
state
courts
wait
for
electoral
majorities
to
extend
gay
men
and
women
the
fundamental
contractual
right
of
marriage
enjoyed
by
heterosexuals
Opponents
of
gay
marriage
like
19th
century
proponents
of
segregation
essentially
are
claiming
the
right
to
protect
their
cultural
and
religious
beliefs
by
enshrining
them
in
law
Both
Republicans
catering
to
a
socially
conservative
base
and
liberal
Democrats
appeasing
a
divided
center
now
argue
that
gays
and
lesbians
can
enjoy
the
same
rights
afforded
to
straight
couples
through
contract
law
while
reserving
the
term
marriage
for
heterosexuals
But
they're
being
disingenuous
To
be
consistent
they'd
support
civil
unions
for
straights
who
could
then
take
their
state-issued
licenses
to
priests
rabbis
and
pastors
and
be
blessed
as
married.'....A
few
years
ago
I
would
have
been
more
sympathetic
to
the
wait-for-the-voters
approach
Never
a
fan
of
marital
bliss
I
find
myself
empathizing
with
Texas
humorist
and
heterosexual
Kinky
Friedman's
backhanded
support
for
gay
marriage
Because
gays
have
a
right
to
be
just
as
miserable
as
the
rest
of
us
But
as
a
libertarian
I
have
no
problem
with
any
court
actively
legislating
a
fundamental
extension
of
freedom
of
choice
and
equal
protection
of
the
law
The
time
to
wait
for
voters
has
passed

this
liberty
is

By

the

to
generate

not

despite

officials
saying
a
governor
does
not
have
authority
to
extend
polling
place
hours
in
the
state
for
this
election
There's
no
authority
under

to

said
A

only
a

can

Gov

the

Iraq
Wants

U.S
Departure
After

Iraq
wants
to
remove
any
possibility
that
U.S
troops
could
remain
after
2011
from
a
proposed
security
agreement
now
under
negotiation
said
a
Shiite
lawmaker
close
to
Prime
Minister
Nouri
al-Maliki
The
current

would
have
U.S
soldiers
leave
Iraq
by
December
31
2011
unless
the
government
asks
them
to
stay
to

with

or
other
missions
But
Ali
al-Adeeb
a
member
of
the
prime

inner
circle
said
the
government
wants
that
possibility
removed
The
Iraqi
side
wants
to
remove
any
mention
of
a
possible
extension
of
U.S
troops
fearing
that
the
existing
clause
might
be
subjected
to
misinterpretation
or
could
bear
different
interpretation
because
Multinational
Forces
might
demand
for
extension
depending
on
their
evaluation
of
the
security
forces
or
the
incomplete
readiness
of
the
Iraqi
forces
Mr
al-Adeeb
told
The
Associated
Press
The
Bush
administration's
hope
to
secure
the
deal
while
in
office
was
fading
with
the
new
Iraqi
demands
The

go
over
the

proposal
for
changes
but
he
repeated
the

insistence
that
the

is
a
good
text
U.S

have
urged
the

to
consider
what
could
happen
here
if

Economy
Shrinks
As
Consumers
Cut
Back

The
U.S
government
today
reported
the
economy
shrank
in
the
summer
the
strongest
signal
yet
that
a
recession
may
have
already
begun
a
day
after
the
Federal
Reserve
slashed
a
key
interest
rate
to
battle
an
economic
downturn
The
Commerce
Department
reported
that
the
gross
domestic
product
the
broadest
measure
of
economic
health
fell
at
an
annual
rate
of
0.3
in
the
July-September
period
a
significant
slowdown
after
growth
of
2.8
in
the
prior
quarter
The
spring
activity
had
been
boosted
by
the
168
billion
economic
stimulus
program
but
the
economy
ran
into
a
wall
in
the
summer
as
the
mass
mailings
of
stimulus
checks
ended
and
consumer
confidence
was
shaken
by
the
upheavals
on
global
markets
Consumer
spending
which
accounts
for
two-thirds
of
the
U.S
economy
dropped
by
the
largest
amount
in
28
years
in
the
third
quarter
The
classic
definition
of
a
recession
is
two
consecutive
quarters
of
negative
GDP
Many
analysts
believe
the
GDP
will
decline
in
the
current
October-December
period
by
an
even
larger
amount
and
they
are
forecasting
a
negative
GDP
figure
in
the
first
three
months
of
next
year
The
National
Bureau
of
Economic
Research
which
is
the
official
arbiter
of
recessions
in
this
country
has
not
said
when
it

LARRY
ELDER
OP-ED
Senator
Government
The
libertarian
Republican
commentator
discusses
Sen
Barack
Obama's
views
on
wealth
redistribution
The
framers
of
the
Constitution
expected
a
limited
federal
government
They
viewed
the
Constitution
as
a
contract
between
citizens
and
government
designed
to
restrain
the
fed
from
undue
intrusion
into
our
bedrooms
and
our
wallets
For
example
the
father
of
the
Constitution
James
Madison
vehemently
objected
to
a
1792
congressional
appropriation
of
15,000
to
assist
some
French
refugees
Madison
wrote
I
cannot
undertake
to
lay
my
finger
on
that
article
of
the
Constitution
which
granted
a
right
to
Congress
of
expending
on
objects
of
benevolence
the
money
of
their
constituents
But
rarely
does
a
politician
even
a
leftist
Democrat
flat-out
say
he
intends
to
take
money
out
of
Pocket
A
and
put
it
into
Pocket
B
in
order
to
spread
the
wealth
Usually
politicians
justify
the
money
and
power
grab
by
calling
it
an
investment
Or
they
falsely
and
unconstitutionally
call
things
like
health
care
education
or
job
training
civil
rights
Mr
Elder
continues
his
commentary
The
issue
to
Obama
turns
not
on
whether
government
exists
to
redistribute
the
wealth
but
on
how
it
should
be
done
But
he
intends
for
it
to
be
done
Expect
an
Obama
presidency
to
try
and
spread
the
wealth
in
two
ways
through
Congress
and
through
the
courts
He
first
wants
to
raise
taxes
income
payroll
capital
gains
dividends
and
estate
on
the
so-called
rich
After
all
he
calls
this
a
matter
of
neighborliness
Biden
calls
it
a
matter
of
patriotism
Second
Obama
wants
to
appoint
judges
who
view
the
Constitution
not
as
a
contract
but
as
an
obstacle
to
circumvent
My
response
This
is
an
issue
where
I
strongly
disagree
with
Sen
Obama
Perhaps
Sen
Obama
can
lead
by
example
and
redistribute
his
personal
wealth
to
his
own
brother
who
lives
over
in
Kenya
on
just
US$12

firm
raises
an
issue
that
some
strategists
believe
has
mistakenly
been
underplayed
by
the
McCain
campaign
If
Barack
Obama
becomes
president
your
Second
Amendment
right
to
defend
yourself
could
be
in
danger
In
fact
in
Illinois
Obama
voted
to
prosecute
law-abiding
citizens
who
used
a
gun
to
defend
themselves
or
their
families
says
a
narrator
in
the
RNC
spot
The
ad
which
is
airing
on
stations
that
have
a
variety
of
formats
isn't
being
run
in
major
markets
such
as
Kansas
City
and
St
Louis
Missouri
but
is
being
aired
heavily
in
rural
areas
and
smaller
markets
such
as
Joplin
Springfield
and
Cape
Girardeau
Missouri
for
example
He
continues
The
spot's
message
surely
will
resonate
with
conservative
Republicans
and
could
help
with
turnout
among
those
partisans
But
the
major
target
audience
appears
to
be
conservative
Democrats
many
of
whom
have
leaned
toward
Obama
recently
because
of
economic
fears
and
uncertainty
but
surely
are
closer
to
the
GOP's
positions
on
cultural
issues
Interestingly
the
ad
also
could
help
GOP
candidates
for
the
House
and
Senate
since
they
too
are
losing
those
same
conservative
Democratic
voters
You
can
bet
that
it's
no
coincidence
the
ad
is
airing
in
North
Carolina
which
has
both
a
Senate
and
a
gubernatorial
race
as
well
as
a
hot
House
contest
and
Missouri
with
a
race
for
governor
and
two
key
House
contests
There
are
also
multiple
hot
House
races
in
rural
areas
of
Ohio
where
the
spot
also
is
running
The
RNC's
Independent
Expenditure
TV
blitz
has
been
heaviest
in
Ohio
Florida
North
Carolina
Missouri
and
Virginia
And
more
Finally
Republican
candidates
increasingly
are
turning
to
a
message
of
don't
give
liberals
a
blank
check
in
Washington
The
National
Republican
Senatorial
Committee
has
been
up
with
two
no
blank
check
spots
in
North
Carolina
for
Sen
Elizabeth
Dole
as
well
as
a
similar
spot
against
Sen
Mary
Landrieu
in
Louisiana
Now
Pennsylvania
GOP
congressional
hopeful
Chris
Hackett
is
airing
a
TV
spot
featuring
Sen
Arlen
Specter
R-Pennsylvania
that
delivers
the
same
message

COMMENTARY
Obama's
Dangerous
Alignments
The
conservative
Republican
writes
Last
week
an
enemy
of
the
United
States
spoke
out
and
endorsed
an
American
presidential
candidate
Senator
Barack
Obama
Taken
with
other
recent
developments
voters
should
be
deeply
disturbed
with
this
embrace
of
Mr
Obama's
campaign
to
become
the
U.S
commander
in-chief
Ali
Larijani
is
the
Speaker
of
the
Iranian
Parliament
and
was
Iran's
representative
to
the
United
Nations
who
kept
that
international
body
from
taking
action
regarding
Iran's
program
to
expand
its
nuclear
capabilities
On
October
22
Speaker
Larijani
said
that
the
regime
in
Iran
would
like
to
see
Mr
Obama
elected
president
Mr
Larijani
is
not
the
first
hostile
foreign
leader
to
endorse
or
be
aligned
with
Mr
Obama
In
April
top
Hamas
advisor
Ahmed
Yousef
also
endorsed
Mr
Obama
Mr
Obama's
long-time
associate
and
self-described
Marxist
Bill
Ayers
actively
backs
him
Mr
Obama's
mentor
and
two-decade
long
spiritual
leader
Rev
Jeremiah
Wright
traveled
to
Libya
to
meet
with
the
controversial
Moammar
Gadhafi
His
church
published
a
pro-Hamas
piece
on
Rev
Wright's
Pastor's
Page
The
article
defended
terrorism
against
Israel
and
denied
Israel's
right
to
exist
He
continues
his
commentary
There's
more
The
L.A
Times
has
video
of
Barack
Obama
toasting
an
anti-Israel
activist
associated
with
the
Palestinians
and
standing
by
as
an
anti-Semitic
poem
was
read
We
don't
know
the
details
because
the
L.A
Times
which
has
endorsed
Mr
Obama
refuses
to
allow
anyone
to
see
the
video
Also
last
week
someone
said
that
electing
Barack
Obama
would
provoke
America's
enemies
to
create
an
international
crisis
If
a
Republican
had
made
the
charge
the
media
would
be
apoplectic
But
they're
in
a
terrible
bind
because
it
was
said
by
Mr
Obama's
running
mate
Joe
Biden
And
more
Mr
Obama
would
be
only
the
second
president
to
never
serve
in
uniform
He
attended
a
church
for
twenty
years
where
the
pastor
howls
God
damn
American
and
worked
with
an
unrepentant
terrorist
who
bombed
U.S
buildings
Add
to
that
Mr
Obama's
promises
He
pledges
to
de-fund
our
weapon
development
programs
like
missile
defense
to
cut
defense
spending
on
programs
that
he
with
no
military
expertise
deems
unwarranted
and
seems
to
be
appalling
deferential
to
foreign
opinions
When
Mr
Obama's
inexperience
and
defense
cutting
promises
are
taken
with
his
arresting
plan
to
meet
with
the
despots
of
Iran
Venezuela
North
Korea
Cuba
and
Syria
without
preconditions
you
have
an
invitation
for
Geo-political
mischief
My
response
Hold
up
Let
me
put
my
Master's
degree
in
political
science
to
work
Sen
Obama
would
not
be
only
the
second
president
to
never
serve
in
uniform
Hardly
Yes
President
Bill
Clinton
never
served
in
uniform
Off
the
top
of
my
head
However
neither
did
President
John
Adams
nor
his
son
who
also
became
president
Neither
did
Presidents
Woodrow
Wilson
Herbert
Hoover
or
Franklin
D
Roosevelt
I'd
have
to
look
it
up
to
be
sure
but
I
recall
that
there
were
at
least
eight
or
nine
U.S
presidents
who've
never
done
military
service

Eduwonk.com
a
moderate-liberal
Democratic
blog
about
teacher
training
There
has
been
a
pretty
raging
debate
in
education
for
some
time
about
teacher
training
that
and
alternative
certification
of
teachers
Overall
the
spectrum
of
views
runs
from
those
arguing
that
every
teacher
should
complete
a
medical
school-like
training
regimen
with
classroom
and
practical
experience
to
those
arguing
that
basically
anyone
with
a
bachelor's
degree
and
without
a
criminal
record
should
be
able
apply
for
a
teaching
job
In
general
the
evidence
from
methodologically
solid
studies
is
not
encouraging
in
terms
of
the
value
of
traditionally
prepared
teachers
being
more
effective
relative
to
those
coming
through
other
routes
This
also
raises
some
serious
cost-benefit
issues
given
the
public
and
non-public
resources
teacher
training
consumes
But
a
lot
of
people
on
both
sides
of
the
debate
myself
included
have
figured
this
state
of
affairs
owed
more
to
the
low-quality
of
most
training
programs
than
anything
inherent
to
the
work
of
training
new
teachers
The
education
blog's
commentary
continues
But
there
are
thoughtful
people
who
have
argued
that
because
the
evidence
on
teacher
preparation
is
weak
and
the
best
predictor
of
who
will
be
a
good
teacher
is
actual
performance
in
the
classroom
that
perhaps
a
pretty
radical
redirection
of
resources
is
the
best
policy
strategy
In
other
words
start
to
invest
in
teachers
through
much
higher
salaries
intensive
professional
training
and
growth
opportunities
etc…after
a
few
years
in
the
classroom
with
demonstrated
effectiveness
and
pretty
aggressively
weed
out
the
lower
performers
I
have
no
problem
weeding
out
the
low-performers
but
I've
been
somewhat
skeptical
of
the
idea
of
backloading
too
much
training
and
salary
preferring
instead
to
see
training
and
induction
restructured
and
re-sequenced
so
that
people
get
training
in
supervised
settings
in
schools

Thomas
Sowell
on
A
Perfect
Storm
The
conservative
commentator
argues
that
a
Barack
Obama
presidency
would
be
historic
and
catastrophic
for
the
United
States
of
America
Once
the
election
is
over
the
glittering
generalities
of
rhetoric
and
style
will
mean
nothing
Everything
will
depend
on
performance
in
facing
huge
challenges
domestic
and
foreign
Performance
is
where
Barack
Obama
has
nothing
to
show
for
his
political
career
either
in
Illinois
or
in
Washington
Policies
that
he
proposes
under
the
banner
of
change
are
almost
all
policies
that
have
been
tried
repeatedly
in
other
countries
and
failed
repeatedly
in
other
countries
Politicians
telling
businesses
how
to
operate
That's
been
tried
in
countries
around
the
world
especially
during
the
second
half
of
the
20th
century
It
has
failed
so
often
and
so
badly
that
even
socialist
and
communist
governments
were
freeing
up
their
markets
by
the
end
of
the
century
The
economies
of
China
and
India
began
their
take-off
into
high
rates
of
growth
when
they
got
rid
of
precisely
the
kinds
of
policies
that
Obama
is
advocating
for
the
United
States
under
the
magic
mantra
of
change
Putting
restrictions
on
international
trade
in
order
to
save
jobs
at
home
That
was
tried
here
with
the
Hawley-Smoot
tariff
during
the
Great
Depression
Unemployment
was
9
percent
when
that
tariff
was
passed
to
save
jobs
but
unemployment
went
up
instead
of
down
and
reached
25
percent
before
the
decade
was
over
He
continues
his
commentary
Higher
taxes
to
spread
the
well
around
as
Obama
puts
it
The
idea
of
redistributing
wealth
has
turned
into
the
reality
of
redistributing
poverty
in
countries
where
wealth
has
fled
and
the
production
of
new
wealth
has
been
stifled
by
a
lack
of
incentives
Economic
disasters
however
may
pale
by
comparison
with
the
catastrophe
of
Iran
with
nuclear
weapons
Glib
rhetoric
about
Iran
being
a
small
country
as
Obama
called
it
will
be
a
bitter
irony
for
Americans
who
will
have
to
live
in
the
shadow
of
a
nuclear
threat
that
cannot
be
deterred
as
that
of
the
Soviet
Union
could
be
by
the
threat
of
a
nuclear
counter-attack
