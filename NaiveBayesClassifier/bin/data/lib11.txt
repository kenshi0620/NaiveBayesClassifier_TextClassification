no

who
he
placed
on

McCain's
Sexist
VP
Pick
The
American
Prospect
It's
clear
that
Republicans
believe
that
what
made
Hillary
Clintonsuch
a
good
candidate
was
her
gender
not
her
political
experience
orpositions
on
the
issues
And
McCain's
decision
to
pick
Palin
shows
hetook
this
message
to
heart
and
chose
to
add
her
to
the
ticket
primarilybecause
of
her
gender
In
so
doing
McCain
has
turned
the
idea
of
thefirst
woman
in
the
White
House
from
a
true
moment
of
change
to
an
emptypander
Why
is
this
a
pander
Because
Palin
is
not
a
woman
who
has
a
recordof
representing
women's
interests
She
is
beloved
by
extremelyright-wing
conservatives
for
her
anti-choice
record
fittingly
she's
amember
of
the
faux-feminist
anti-choice
group
Feminists
for
Life).Palin
supports
federal
anti-gay
marriage
legislation
She
believesschools
should
teach
creationism
Alaska
is
currently
consideringspending
more
on
abstinence-only
sex
education
And
when
it
comes
to
aslew
of
other
issues
of
importance
to
women
such
as
equal
pay
she'snot
on
the
record
Of
course
I'm
of
the
belief
that
more
women
in
politics
acrossthe
ideological
spectrum
is
always
a
good
thing
On
a
superficiallevel
nominating
a
woman
to
the
Republican
presidential
ticket
isindeed
a
milestone
But
the
real
reason
many
women
were
excited
aboutHillary
Clinton's
candidacy
is
that
she
was
the
whole
package
apolitician
with
a
solid
record
on
issues
like
choice
and
fair
pay
andwith
a
lot
of
experience
who
was
also
a
woman
Even
feministsI
disagreed
with
during
the
primary
made
the
compelling
point
that
itwasn't
just
about
Hillary's
gender
It
was
about

For
someone
who's
been
spending
a
majority
of
her
blog-time
criticizing
him
I
think
he
made
an
excellent
case
Of
course
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
reality
of
it
all
is
that
politcians
are
just
telling
us
what
they
think
we
want
to
hear
It's
like
a
drug
that
kicks
in
everytime
for
instance
the
Democratic
nominee
utters
his
support
for
universal
healthcare
a
living
wage
defending
a
woman's
right
to
choose
equal
pay
in
the
work
place
etc
etc
etc
I'd
prefer
to
save
my
euphoria
for
his

speech

difficult
as
it
is

The
resemblance
between
Obama
and
MLK
according
to
the
Black
Agenda
Report
As
the
Democratic
wing
of
America's
permanent
ruling
party
convenes
in
Denver
Democrats
have
dominated
the
Congress
for
almost
two
years
There
are
more
US
troops
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
than
in
2006
but
no
Democratic
deadline
to
end
these
useless
predatory
wars
1.1
million
African
Americans
languish
behind
bars
while
the
dispossession
and
exile
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
blacks
from
the
Gulf
Coast
begins
its
fourth
year
The
convention
will
be
a
media
circus
and
will
culminate
with
the
co-branding
of
Barack
Obama
with
Dr
King's
1963
I
Have
A
Dream
speech
is
intended
to
establish
deep
symbolic
references
between
the
two
in
the
minds
of
voters
despite
their
diametrically
opposed
politics
Hope
is
a
powerful
drug
indeed
Even
though
Dr
King
died
supporting
a
black
union
in
the
midst
of
a
militant
citywide
strike
the
media-endorsed
versions
of
his
life
of
the
Freedom
Movement
and
of
the
Dream
probably
trademarked
which
the
election
of
Barack
Obama
will
supposedly
fulfill
are
never
about
collective
action
or
democracy
in
workplaces
They
never
mention
the
right
won
and
held
by
people
in
most
other
nations
around
the
world
to
organize
and
strike
without
being
fired
or
penalized
Despite
Dr
King's
prescient
warnings
that
if
we
did
not
swiftly
end
the
war
in
Vietnam
and
turn
our
energies
to
peace
abroad
and
justice
at
home
we
would
be
marching
against
US
wars
here
there
and
everywhere
we
will
be
told
in
Denver
on
the
45th
anniversary
of
I
Have
A
Dream
that
his
legacy
is
being
satisfied
by
the
elevation
of
a
black
candidate
who
celebrates
empire
who
endorses
the
so-called
worldwide
war
on
terror
who
has
assured
us
he
will
not
end
the
war
in
Iraq
while
he
co-signs
the
Bush
threats
to
Iran
and
escalates
the
conflict
in
Afghanistan
perhaps
extending
it
to
nuclear-armed
Pakistan
more]Frankly
I
don't
like
the
use
of
the
deceased
to
promote
a
product
whether
it
be
a
vacuum
cleaner
or
politician
I
mean
what
if
MLK
would
have
actually
been
a
McKinney
supporter
It's
possible
And
if
we
self-proclaimed
liberals
leftists
and
progressives
truly
voted
our
convictions
this
November
we
might
actually
put
a
real
candidate
for
the
change
we've
wanted
all
these
years
in
the
W.H
or
at
least
weaken
the
two
party
political
stranglehold
But
of
course
John
McCain
is
just
too
scary

Pelosi
Bush
a
total
failure
Saturday

19

as
they
say
If

Bush
and
Pelosi
Both
are
failures
Speaker
of
the
House
Nancy
Pelosi
Thursday
called
the
Presidency
of
George
W
Bush
a
total
failure
True
Bush
will
go
down
in
history
as
one
of
the
most
corrupt
and
incompetent
Presidents
His
seven-and-a-half
years
in
office
have
been
a
disaster
Everything
he's
touched
from
his
ill-conceived
Iraq
war
to
his
administration's
bungling
of
the
economy
to
its
shredding
of
the
Constitution
are
textbook
cases
of
disaster
But
history
will
not
be
kind
to
Ms
Pelosi
either
As
the
first
woman
speaker
of
the
House
she
has
been
an
equal
disaster
a
mixture
of
bumbling
inefficiency
and
corruption
that
failed
to
deliver
on
the
promises
that
swept
her
and
her
equally-corrupt
party
into
power
in
the
2006
mid-term
elections
more]I
don't
totally
agree
with
Doug
Thompson's
assessment
that
both
parties
are
equally-corrupt
Then
again
maybe
the
Democrats
are
just
better
at
hiding
such
indiscretions
I
do
agree
that
the
Democratic
party
sold
us
a
bill
of
goods
on
which
they
failed
to
deliver
Continueing
our
occupation
in
Iraq
their
spineless
attempts
to
counter
this
administration's
failed
policies
taking
impeachment
off

table
on
which
by
the
way
Madame
Speaker
is
NOW
willing
to
hold
a
hearing
literally
speaking
that
is
Impeachment
is
still
off
the
table
but
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
is
willing
to
hear
Rep
Kucinich
vent
on
how
this
president
abused
his
power
just
blog
Dennis
Bush
is
leaving
office
in
4
months
At
this
point
even
I
don't
see
the
point
in
persueing
this
Such
a
waste
of
time
on
something
that
should
have
been
persued
a
long

ago

guess
a

to
fight
terrorism
and
make
our
country
more
secure
However
any
surveillance
program
must
contain
safeguards
to
protect
the
rights
of
Americans
against
abuse
and
to
preserve
clear
lines
of
oversight
and
accountability
over
this
administration
I
applaud
the
efforts
of
my
colleagues
who
negotiated
this
legislation
and
I
respect
my
colleagues
who
reached
a
different
conclusion
on
today's
vote
I
do
so
because
this
is
a
difficult
issue
Nonetheless
I
could
not
vote
for
the
legislation
in
its
current
form
The
legislation
would
overhaul
the
law
that
governs
the
administration's
surveillance
activities
Some
of
the
legislation's
provisions
place
guidelines
and
restrictions
on
the
operational
details
of
the
surveillance
activities
others
increase
judicial
and
legislative
oversight
of
those
activities
and
still
others
relate
to
immunity
for
telecommunications
companies
that
participated
in
the
administration's
surveillance
activities
While
this
legislation
does
strengthen
oversight
of
the
administration's
surveillance
activities
over
previous
drafts
in
many
respects
the
oversight
in
the
bill
continues
to
come
up
short
For
instance
while
the
bill
nominally
calls
for
increased
oversight
by
the
FISA
Court
its
ability
to
serve
as
a
meaningful
check
on
the
President's
power
is
debatable
The
clearest
example
of
this
is
the
limited
power
given
to
the
FISA
Court
to
review
the
government's
targeting
and
minimization
procedures
But
the
legislation
has
other
significant
shortcomings
The
legislation
also
makes
no
meaningful
change
to
the
immunity
provisions
There
is
little
disagreement
that
the
legislation
effectively
grants
retroactive
immunity
to
the
telecommunications
companies
In
my
judgment
immunity
under
these
circumstances
has
the
practical
effect
of
shutting
down
a
critical
avenue
for
holding
the
administration
accountable
for
its
conduct
It
is
precisely
why
I
have
supported
efforts
in
the
Senate
to
strip
the
bill
of
these
provisions
both
today
and
during
previous
debates
on
this
subject
Unfortunately
these
efforts
have
been
unsuccessful
What
is
more
even
as
we
considered
this
legislation
the
administration
refused
to
allow
the
overwhelming
majority
of
Senators
to
examine
the
warrantless
wiretapping
program
This
made
it
exceedingly
difficult
for
those
Senators
who
are
not
on
the
Intelligence
and
Judiciary
Committees
to
assess
the
need
for
the
operational
details
of
the
legislation
and
whether
greater
protections
are
necessary
The
same
can
be
said
for
an
assessment
of
the
telecom
immunity
provisions
On
an
issue
of
such
tremendous
importance
to
our
citizens
and
in
particular
to
New
Yorkers
all
Senators
should
have
been
entitled
to
receive
briefings
that
would
have
enabled
them
to
make
an
informed
decision
about
the
merits
of
this
legislation
I
cannot
support
this
legislation
when
we
know
neither
the
nature
of
the
surveillance
activities
authorized
nor
the
role
played
by
telecommunications
companies
granted
immunity
Congress
must
vigorously
check
and
balance
the
president
even
in
the
face
of
dangerous
enemies
and
at
a
time
of
war
That
is
what
sets
us
apart
And
that
is
what
is
vital
to
ensuring
that
any
tool
designed
to
protect
us
is
used
and
used
within
the
law
for
that
purpose
and
that
purpose
alone
I
believe
my
responsibility
requires
that
I
vote
against
this
compromise
and
I
will
continue
to
pursue
reforms
that
will
improve
our
ability
to
collect
intelligence
in
our
efforts
to
combat
terror
and
to
oversee
that
authority
in
Congress.What
could
have
been
Then
again
the
superdelegates
could
change
their
minds
though
I
highly
doubt
they
would

I
don't
remember
when
I
last
posted
this
article
another
July
4th
perhaps
It's
an
excellent
piece
and
well
worth
the
reading
or
re-reading
Patriotism
asks
that
we
embrace
a
unified
America
yet
no
simple
vision
of
America
can
accommodate
its
diversity
Few
of
us
are
able
to
call
ourselves
native
most
of
us
trace
our
family
lineages
to
nations
great
distances
from
these
shores
With
pasing
generations
we
are
assimilated
yet
our
former
cultures
are
never
fully
relinquished
The
heritage
we
retain
and
the
characteristics
of
the
one
we
adopt
intermingle
we
are
defining
and
becoming
American
The
acceptance
of
a
common
historical
view
may
be
considered
the
cornerstone
of
nationalism
yet
when
I
consider
the
most
broadly
accepted
view
of
history
I
realize
that
my
America
is
quite
different
In
my
America
Columbus
was
not
a
benevolent
explorer
who
happened
upon
an
earthly
paradise
that
yielded
itself
bloodlessly
to
his
will
In
my
America
the
native
peoples
of
this
continent
were
not
hostile
savages
unprovoked
to
violence
against
the
benign
European
colonialists
In
my
America
the
tobacco
exports
of
the
newborn
Virginia
settlement
addicted
a
world
to
a
powerful
drug
to
secure
a
market
and
survival
In
my
America
the
capture
tortune
and
enslavement
of
a
race
is
unforgivable
In
my
America
the
blood
and
sweat
of
millions
created
an
industrial
power
and
fortunes
for
relatively
few
In
my
America
there
is
a
hope
that
democracy
is
not
forever
destined
to
be
corrupted
by
wealth
influencing
power
In
my
America
women
will
no
longer
need
to
fight
to
possess
themselves
In
my
America
the
basic
rights
of
all
its
citizens
must
be
respected
and
this
respect
extends
beyond
borders
And
in
my
America
the
burden
of
world
power
will
be
accepted
more
gracefully
with
the
people
of
the
United
States
learning
to
recognize
their
brothers
and
sisters
worldwide
There
is
one
tradition
in
America
I
am
proud
to
inherit
It
is
our
first
freedom
and
the
truest
expression
of
our
Americanism
the
ability
to
dissent
without
fear
It
is
our
right
to
utter
the
words
I
disagree
We
must
feel
at
liberty
to
speak
those
words
to
our
neighbors
our
clergy
our
educators
our
news
media
our
lawmakers
and
above
all
to
the
one
among
us
we
elect
