CONVICTED
Maybe
there's
something
about
scandal-plagued
Alaskan
Republicans
that
leads
to
denial
When
Sarah
Palin
was
found
to
have
violated
state
ethics
laws
she
announced
that
she'd
been
cleared
her
of
any
hint
of
any
kind
of
unethical
activity
This
was
the
opposite
of
reality
Similarly
when
Ted
Stevens
was
found
guilty
of
felony
corruption
charges
he
said
he
hasn't
been
convicted
I've
not
been
convicted
yet
Stevens
said
Thursday
in
a
meeting
with
the
editorial
board
of
the
Fairbanks
Daily
News-Miner
There's
not
a
black
mark
by
my
name
yet
until
the
appeal
is
over
and
I
am
finally
convicted
if
that
happens
If
that
happens
of
course
I'll
do
what's
right
for
Alaska
and
for
the
Senate
I
don't
anticipate
it
happening
and
until
it
happens
I
do
not
have
a
black
mark
Stevens
reiterated
that
position
during
a
televised
debate
late
Thursday
night
declaring
early
in
the
give-and-take
with
Anchorage
Mayor
Mark
Begich
I
have
not
been
convicted
of
anything
Now
I'm
not
an
attorney
but
if
an
accused
criminal
goes
to
trial
and
a
jury
founds
the
accused
guilty
I
think
it's
called
a
conviction
The
defendant
can
appeal
his
conviction
of
course
but
therein
lies
the
point
he's
appealing
his
conviction
I
even
looked
it
up
a
conviction
is
the
judgment
of
a
jury
or
judge
that
a
person
is
guilty
of
a
crime
as
charged
What
on
earth
is

Stevens

STRETCHING
THE
MAP
JUST
A
LITTLE
MORE
The
notion
of
stretching
the
map
was
never
about
downplaying
the
significance
of
Ohio
and
Florida
they
remain
the
two
biggest
battlegrounds
but
it
is
about
making
the
list
of
swing
states
longer
than
two
With
that
in
mind
it's
striking
to
see
where
the
Obama
campaign
is
investing
resources
now
Barack
Obama's
campaign
announced
Friday
that
it
was
going
on
the
air
in
John
McCain's
home
state
of
Arizona
for
the
first
time
this
cycle
as
a
new
CNN
poll
of
polls
released
this
morning
finds
the
Republican
nominee
leading
the
Illinois
senator
there
by
just
4
percentage
points
49
to
45
percent
Six
percent
of
the
state's
voters
said
they
were
unsure
about
their
presidential
pick
Obama
campaign
manager
David
Plouffe
told
reporters
the
campaign's
positive
closing
argument
spot
Something
will
hit
the
airwaves
in
Arizona
He
also
said
the
campaign
was
going
back
on
the
airwaves
in
Georgia
and
North
Dakota
with
its
negative
closing
argument
spot
Rearview
Mirror
which
ties
McCain
to
President
Bush
It's
one
thing
to
open
offices
and
organize
volunteers
in
these
states
but
we're
talking
about
television
advertising
in
the
last
four
days
of
the
campaign
Now
it's
possible
this
ad
buy
is
intended
to
psych
McCain
out
Or
maybe
the
Obama
campaign
has
already
bought
up
every
possible
slot
in
all
the
other
battleground
states
and
was
looking
for
new
ways
to
spend
what's
left
of
its
ad
budget
Either
way
who
would
have
thought
in
say
June
that
Obama
would
air
TV
ads
in
Arizona
Georgia
and
North
Dakota
in
the
campaign's
closing
days
Asked
about
Obama's
new
ad
buy
in
Arizona
McCain
spokesman
Tucker
Bounds
called
it
a
waste
of
his
resources
Perhaps
But
if
it's
foolish
to
waste
money
in
Arizona
why
did
McCain
and
the
RNC
launch
anti-Obama
robocalls
in
the
state
this
week

MCCAIN'S
ROLE
MODEL
This
presidential
campaign
has
featured
more
than
its
share
of
absurdities
but
the
McCain
campaign
using
Sam
Joe
the
Plumber
Wurzelbacher
as
some
kind
of
mascot
has
been
one
of
the
most
inane
Yesterday
this
became
farcical
On
Thursday
Wurzelbacher
had
a
candidate
for
president
calling
for
him
at
a
rally
where
he
was
not
present
At
the
next
John
McCain
rally
he
got
to
offer
a
civics
lesson
to
the
crowd
about
how
they
should
educate
themselves
before
voting
Then
at
the
final
rally
of
the
day
he
had
a
crowd
chanting
his
name
OK
they
weren't
chanting
his
real
name
Joe
Wurzelbacher
They
were
chanting
of
course
Joe-the-plumb-er
in
the
same
rhythm
usually
reserved
for
sporting
events
If
that
wasn't
enough
McCain
introduced
Wurzelbacher
as
an
American
hero
a
great
citizen
of
Ohio
and
my
role
model
On
Tuesday
Wurzelbacher
endorsed
the
insane
idea
that
a
vote
for
Obama
would
be
a
vote
for
the
death
of
Israel
On
Wednesday
Wurzelbacher
played
political
scientist
saying
the
notion
of
progressive
taxation
is
honestly
right
out
of
Karl
Marx's
mouth
No
one
can
debate
that
That's
not
my
opinion
That's
fact
And
on
Thursday
McCain
believes
Wurzelbacher
is
an
American
hero
and
his
personal
role
model
As
John
Cole
concluded
the
other
day
The
McCain
campaign
is
now
a
surrealist
farce
Or
maybe
I
meant
surrealist
force

TALKING
TO
OUR
ENEMIES
Gen
David
Petraeus
has
been
cautious
about
the
presidential
election
but
he's
come
close
to
all-but
endorsing
Barack
Obama's
position
on
negotiating
with
U.S
rivals
A
few
weeks
ago
a
day
after
a
presidential
debate
Petraeus
said
I
do
think
you
have
to
talk
to
enemies
I
mean
what
we
did
do
in
Iraq
ultimately
was
sit
down
with
some
of
those
that
were
shooting
at
us
The
Centcom
commander
has
been
following
through
on
this
quite
a
bit
Petraeus
has
already
endorsed
talking
to
the
Taliban
in
Afghanistan
and
reportedly
wants
to
engage
Syria
as
well
What's
the
hitch
The
Bush
administration
apparently
won't
let
him
ABC
News
has
learned
Petraeus
proposed
visiting
Syria
shortly
after
taking
over
as
the
top
U.S
commander
for
the
Middle
East
The
idea
was
swiftly
rejected
by
Bush
administration
officials
at
the
White
House
State
Department
and
the
Pentagon
Petraeus
who
becomes
the
commander
of
U.S
Central
Command
Centcom
Friday
had
hoped
to
meet
in
Damascus
with
Syrian
President
Bashar
al-Assad
Petraeus
proposed
the
trip
and
senior
officials
objected
before
the
covert
U.S
strike
earlier
this
week
on
a
target
inside
Syria's
border
with
Iraq
Officials
familiar
with
Petraeus
thinking
on
the
subject
say
he
wants
to
engage
Syria
in
part
because
he
believes
that
U.S
diplomacy
can
be
used
to
drive
a
wedge
between
Syria
and
Iran
He
plans
to
continue
pushing
the
idea
When
the
timing
is
right
we
ought
to
go
in
there
and
have
a
good
discussion
with
the
Syrians
said
a
Defense
Department
official
close
to
Petraeus
It's
a
meaningful
dialogue
to
have
It's
probably
a
mistake
to
view
everything
through
the
lens
of
the
presidential
campaign
but
this
ABC
News
report
is
one
of
the
day's
most
fascinating
items
Not
only
is
Petraeus
at
odds
with
Bush
but
people
close
to
him
are
leaking
this
information
just
a
few
days
before
the
presidential
election
What's
more
it
reinforces
the
dynamic
that's
been
apparent
for
a
while
when
it
comes
to
a
national
security
strategy
predicated
on
diplomacy
Obama
and
Petraeus
are
on
one
side
while
McCain
and
Bush
are
on
the
other

GUTTING
THE
PENTAGON
Sarah
Palin
campaigned
in
Erie
Pennsylvania
yesterday
and
blasted
Democrats
for
allegedly
wanting
to
cut
funding
from
the
Pentagon
budget
We're
fighting
two
wars
with
a
force
strength
in
need
of
rebuilding
not
in
being
gutted
Palin
said
And
they
Democrats
think
it's
the
perfect
time
to
radically
reduce
defense
spending
What
are
they
thinking
Yes
what
kind
of
monster
would
decide
in
the
midst
of
two
wars
to
cut
defense
spending
Why
to
hear
Palin
tell
it
you'd
have
to
be
some
kind
of
nut
to
even
think
about
reducing
Pentagon
funding
right
now
With
this
in
mind
it's
probably
an
inconvenient
time
to
point
out
that
John
McCain
has
promised
to
reduce
defense
spending
He
told
ABC
News
in
April
I'm
cutting
billions
and
billions
out
of
defense
spending
which
are
not
earmarks
The
400
million
ship
that
they
had
to
scrap
it
was
supposed
to
cost
140
billion
The
30
billion
I
believe
it
is
add-on
for
a
system
in
the
Army
that's
gone
up
30
billion
and
we
still
haven't
got
any
result
from
it
The
50
million
contract
to
some
buddy
of
Air
Force
generals
I
mean
there's
so
many
billions
out
there
just
in
defense
It
wasn't
just
a
random
slip
this
is
actually
a
clearly
articulated
McCain
campaign
policy
McCain's
top
economic
adviser
Doug
Holtz-Eakin
blithely
supposes
that
cuts
in
defense
spending
could
make
up
for
reducing
the
corporate
tax
rate
from
35
to
25
and
the
subsequent
shrinkage
in
federal
revenues
Get
that
The
national
security
candidate
wants
to
cut
spending
on
our
national
security
So
Sarah
Palin
what
are
you
thinking
Based
on
your
attacks
yesterday
it
sounds
like
you
may
not
be
comfortable
with
McCain's
plan
to
reduce
the
Pentagon's
budget
in
the
midst
of
two
wars

A
BUBBLE
BOY
FOR
A
NEW
GENERATION
Bush's
Bubble
Boy
policies
have
always
been
a
subject
of
fascination
for
me
In
order
to
keep
the
president
shielded
from
those
who
may
disagree
with
him
the
Bush
White
House
has
gone
to
comical
lengths
to
keep
dissenters
at
bay
This
has
at
various
times
included
blocking
people
from
attending
public
events
based
on
their
bumper
stickers
and
requiring
loyalty
oaths
for
tickets
This
week
it
appears
the
McCain
gang
wants
to
pick
up
where
the
Bush
gang
is
leaving
off
via
Atrios
Audience
members
escorted
out
of
Sen
John
McCain's
R-Ariz
campaign
event
in
Cedar
Falls
questioned
why
they
were
asked
to
leave
Sunday's
rally
even
though
they
were
not
protesting
David
Zarifis
director
of
public
safety
for
the
University
of
Northern
Iowa
said
McCain
staffers
requested
UNI
police
assist
in
escorting
out
about
four
or
five
people
from
the
rally
prior
to
McCain's
speech
Zarifis
said
while
the
people
who
were
taken
out
weren't
protesting
or
causing
problems
McCain's
staff
were
worried
they
would
during
the
speech
It's
the
kind
of
profiling
only
a
Republican
leader
could
love
In
this
case
the
RNC
and
the
McCain
campaign
removed
law-abiding
non-disruptive
Americans
from
a
campaign
event
based
solely
on
hunches
if
they
thought
you
might
be
a
protestor
the
basis
of
your
appearance
you
were
ejected
If
you
resisted
you
were
threatened
with
arrest
for
trespassing
In
this
case
the
dragnet
even
caught
McCain
supporters
who
apparently
looked
suspicious
And
by
suspicious
I
mean
young
Lara
Elborno
a
student
at
the
University
of
Iowa
was
one
about
about
20
people
asked
to
leave
the
McCain
event
and
noted
It
was
pretty
much
all
young
people
the
college
demographic
In
the
McCain
campaign
I
suppose
this
is
what
passes
for
youth
outreach
But
the
key
point
here
is
that
this
is
exactly
how
the
Bush/Cheney
operation
has
acted
for
eight
years
I'd
hoped
McCain
would
have
learned
what
not
to
do
when
it
comes
to
being
yet
another
Bubble
Boy
Has
anyone
heard
about
whether

MAKING
THE
CASE
Lawrence
Eagleburger
deputy
secretary
of
State
under
Bush
I
has
been
a
McCain
campaign
advisor
and
occasional
surrogate
for
nearly
a
year
As
it
happens
once
in
a
while
Eagleburger
strays
from
the
script
and
that's
not
a
good
thing
for
McCain
In
March
for
example
Eagleburger
appeared
at
an
event
in
DC
where
he
described
the
GOP's
religious
right
base
as
a
serious
problem
that
he
wants
to
see
Republicans
fight
hard
against
Yesterday
Eagleburger
appeared
on
NPR
as
part
of
a
segment
on
making
the
case
for
a
McCain
presidency
His
candor
was
welcome
but
not
by
McCain
campaign
headquarters
A
former
Republican
Secretary
of
State
and
one
of
John
McCain's
most
prominent
supporters
offered
a
stunningly
frank
and
remarkably
bleak
assessment
of
Sarah
Palin's
capacity
to
handle
the
presidency
should
such
a
scenario
arise
Lawrence
Eagleburger
who
served
as
Secretary
of
State
under
George
H.W
Bush
and
whose
endorsement
is
often
trumpeted
by
McCain
said
on
Thursday
that
the
Alaska
governor
is
not
only
unprepared
to
take
over
the
job
on
a
moment's
notice
but
even
after
some
time
in
office
would
only
amount
to
an
adequate
commander
in
chief
And
I
devoutly
hope
that
she
would
never
be
tested
he
added
for
good
measure
referring
both
to
Palin's
policy
dexterity
and
the
idea
of
McCain
not
making
it
through
his
time
in
office
The
NPR
host
went
on
to
ask
if
Palin
could
step
in
during
a
time
of
crisis
It
is
a
very
good
question
Eagleburger
said
He
paused
laughed
and
added
I'm
being
facetious
here
Look
of
course
not
Just
to
add
to
the
entertainment
Eagleburger
added
Give
her
some
time
in
the
office
and
I
think
the
answer
would
be
she
will
be
pause
adequate
I
can't
say
that
she
would
be
a
genius
in
the
job
But
I
think
she
would
be
enough
to
get
us
through
a
four
year
well
I
hope
not
get
us
through
whatever
period
of
time
was
necessary
And
I
devoutly
hope
that
it
would
never
be
tested
Keep
in
mind
Eagleburger
is
not
just
some
random
McCain
supporter
McCain
touts
Eagleburger's
endorsement
all
the
time
and
the
campaign
sent
Eagleburger
to
NPR
to
emphasize
why
voters
should
support
the
Republican
ticket
Last
week
McCain
chatted
with
Don
Imus
and
expressed
frustration
about
Republicans
who've
questioned
Palin's
qualifications
What's
their
problem
McCain
asked
I
think
she
is
the
most
qualified
of
any
that
has
run
recently
for
vice
president
Just
days
before
the
election
McCain
hasn't
even
convinced
his
own
advisors
of
this
Nor
has
he
made
the
case
to
voters
a
new
New
York
Times/CBS
News
poll
found
59
of
Americans
consider
Palin
unprepared
for
national
office
The
report
added
The
increase
in
the
number
of
voters
who
said
Ms
Palin
was
not
prepared
was
driven
almost
entirely
by
Republicans
and
independents

By

Khalidi
I
want
to
second
my
Obsidian
Wings
co-blogger
Eric
Martin's
condemnation
of
John
McCain's
attack's
on
Rashid
Khalidi
Eric
quoted
Juan
Cole
which
led
some
commenters
to
question
Cole's
objectivity
I
will
therefore
cite
two
other
people
First
Barnett
Rubin
I
actually
find
it
demeaning
insulting
and
depressing
to
have
to
defend
Rashid
I
could
say
I
know
him
he
has
been
a
guest
in
my
home
in
New
York
and
in
my
rented
house
in
Provence
he
bears
absolutely
no
resemblance
to
the
image
these
despicable
people
are
trying
to
project
of
him
and
lot's
more
I
could
point
out
that
I
am
Jewish
and
have
VISIBLE
JEWISH
ARTIFACTS
IN
MY
HOME
which
did
not
appear
to
alarm
Rashid
if
he
even
noticed
them
but
it
is
all
just
so
ridiculous
I
don't
know
what
to
say
I
don't
want
to
treat
these
charges
with
the
respect
of
a
refutation
I
just
want
to
express
my
disgust
with
those
who
uttered
them
and
my
solidarity
with
my
friend
Rashid
Khalidi
Second
Scott
Horton
In
the
current
issue
of
National
Review
Andrew
McCarthy
continues
his
campaign
to
link
the
Democratic
nominee
to
various
and
sundry
Hyde
Park
radicals
This
time
it
is
PLO
advisor
turned
University
of
Chicago
professor
Rashid
Khalidi
who
now
heads
the
Middle
Eastern
Studies
Department
at
Columbia
University
Khalidi
we
learn
makes
a
habit
of
justifying
and
supporting
the
work
of
terrorists
and
is
a
former
mouthpiece
for
master
terrorist
Yasser
Arafat
And
then
we
learn
that
this
same
Khalidi
knows
Obama
and
that
his
children
even
babysat
for
Obama's
kids
This
doesn't
sound
much
like
the
Rashid
Khalidi
I
know
I've
followed
his
career
for
many
years
read
his
articles
and
books
listened
to
his
presentations
and
engaged
him
in
discussions
of
politics
the
arts
and
history
In
fact
as
McCarthy's
piece
ran
I
was
midway
through
an
advance
copy
of
Khalidi's
new
book
Sowing
Crisis
The
Cold
War
and
American
Dominance
in
the
Middle
East
I'll
be
reviewing
it
next
month
stay
tuned
Rashid
Khalidi
is
an
American
academic
of
extraordinary
ability
and
sharp
insights
He
is
also
deeply
committed
to
stemming
violence
in
the
Middle
East
promoting
a
culture
that
embraces
human
rights
as
a
fundamental
notion
and
building
democratic
societies
In
a
sense
Khalidi's
formula
for
solving
the
Middle
East
crisis
has
not
been
radically
different
from
George
W
Bush's
both
believe
in
American
values
and
approaches
However
whereas
Bush
believes
these
values
can
be
introduced
in
the
wake
of
bombs
and
at
the
barrel
of
a
gun
Khalidi
disagrees
He
sees
education
and
civic
activism
as
the
path
to
success
and
he
argues
that
pervasive
military
interventionism
has
historically
undermined
the
Middle
East
and
will
continue
to
do
so
Khalidi
has
also
been
one
of
the
most
articulate
critics
of
the
PLO
and
the
Palestinian
Authority
calling
them
repeatedly
on
their
anti-democratic
tendencies
and
their
betrayals
of
their
own
principles
Khalidi
is
also
a
Palestinian
American
There
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
it
is
solely
that
last
fact
that
informs
McCarthy's
ignorant
and
malicious
rants
McCarthy
states
that
Khalidi
founded
the
Arab
American
Action
Network
AAAN
In
fact
he
neither
founded
it
nor
has
anything
to
do
with
it
But
AAAN
is
not
as
McCarthy
suggests
a
political
organization
It
is
a
social-services
organization
largely
funded
by
the
state
of
Illinois
and
private
foundations
that
provides
support
for
English-language
training
citizenship
classes
after-school
and
summer
programs
for
schoolchildren
women's
shelters
and
child
care
among
Chicago's
sizable
Arab
community
and
for
others
on
the
city's
impoverished
South
Side
Does
McCarthy
consider
this
sort
of
civic
activism
objectionable
Since
it
was
advocated
aggressively
by
President
Bush
this
is
compassionate
conservativism
in
action
such
an
objection
would
be
interesting
Nor
was
Khalidi
ever
a
spokesman
for
the
PLO
though
that
was
reported
in
an
erroneous
column
by
the
New
York
Times's
Tom
Friedman
in
1982
That
left
me
curious
about
the
final
and
most
dramatic
accusation
laid
at
Khalidi's
doorstep
that
the
Khalidis
babysat
for
the
Obamas
Was
it
true
I
put
the
question
to
Khalidi
No
it
is
not
true
came
the
crisp
reply
Somehow
that
was
exactly
the
answer
I
expected
I
have
a
suggestion
for
Andy
McCarthy
and
his
Hyde
Park
project
If
he
really
digs
down
deep
enough
he
will
come
up
with
a
Hyde
Park
figure
who
stood
in
constant
close
contact
with
Barack
Obama
and
who
unlike
Ayers
and
Khalidi
really
did
influence
Obama's
thinking
about
law
government
and
policy
He
is
to
my
way
of
thinking
a
genuine
radical
His
name
is
Richard
Posner
and
he
appears
to
be
the
most
frequently
and
positively
cited
judge
and
legal
academic
in
National
Review
I
think
McCain's
attacks
on
Khalidi
are
completely
dishonorable
and
that
comparing
Rashid
Khalidi
to
a
neo-Nazi
in
particular
is
just
beyond
vile
But
even
without
that
it
just
plays
on
anti-Arab
sentiment
Does
anyone
think
that
McCain's
audiences
know
much
about
Rashid
Khalidi
other
than
his
suspiciously
Arab
name
For
that
matter
does
anyone
think
that
McCain
knows
much
about
him
The
fact
that
he
repeats
the
charge
that
Khalidi
was
a
spokesman
for
the
PLO
a
claim
that
Khalidi
denies
and
that
there
is
independent
reason
to
think
is
false
suggests
either
that
he
doesn't
know
or
that
he
doesn't
care
what
the
truth
is
Khalidi
is
just
a
red
flag
to
wave
in
front
of
McCain's
audiences
Mentioning
his
name
produces
the
effect
it
does
because
that
name
is
Arab
McCain
surely
knows
this
Colin
Powell
was
big
enough
to
denounce
this
kind
of
appeal
to
bigotry
Years
ago
I
would
have
imagined
that
McCain
would
do
likewise
or
at
least
that
he
would
not
engage
in
it
himself
I
wish
I
had
been
right
And
I
imagine
that
in
a
few
weeks
when
he
contemplates
the
shredded
remains
of
his
honor
he
will
too

THURSDAY'S
MINI-REPORT
Today's
edition
of
quick
hits
The
Dow
closed
up
nearly
190
points
after
a
0.3
drop
in
GDP
Apparently
investors
expected
the
numbers
to
be
even
worse
It
seems
like
every
campaign
cycle
we
hear
all
about
voting-machine
problems
I
wonder
why
that
is
I'm
not
an
expert
but
if
I
were
the
McCain
campaign
I'd
probably
hesitate
before
putting
Michael
Goldfarb
on
national
television
again
Speaking
of
odd
surrogates
I
don't
think
Rudy
Giuliani
understands
McCain's
healthcare
plan
The
crowd
was
a
little
thin
for
a
McCain
event
in
Ohio
this
morning
so
nearby
schools
bussed
in
thousands
of
kids
to
fill
the
seats
Ashley
Todd
is
free
after
six
days
in
jail
but
will
be
required
to
undergo
mental
health
treatment
The
AP
reported
Her
record
eventually
will
be
expunged
as
long
as
she
goes
to
treatment
stays
out
of
trouble
and
keeps
authorities
apprised
of
her
whereabouts
One
of
Sarah
Palin's
favorite
publications
The
Economist
endorsed
Obama
Ruy
Teixeira
a
friend
of
the
Monthly
has
returned
to
blogging
after
a
lengthy
absence
In
an
unusual
twist
at
least
one
Fox
News
exec
is
defending
the
LA
Times
against
the
McCain
campaign's
attacks
In
a
cringe
worthy
moment
on
the
campaign
trail
today
McCain
tried
to
introduce
Joe
the
Plumber
to
an
audience
As
it
turns
out
Wurzelbacher
had
stood
McCain
up
And
on
a
related
note
Wurzelbacher
is
being
pursued
for
a
major
record
deal
and
could
come
out
with
a
country
album
as
early
as
Inauguration
Day
I
wish
I
were
kidding
Joe
the
Plumber
has
signed
a
deal
with
a
Nashville

exploit
his

for
all
its
worth

ABOUT
THAT
FOX
NEWS
POLL
There
have
been
some
national
polls
showing
John
McCain
narrowing
the
gap
a
bit
this
week
which
is
not
at
all
unexpected
but
Fox
News
raised
some
eyebrows
this
afternoon
with
a
new
poll
showing
Obama's
lead
down
to
just
three
points
nationwide
47
to
44
A
week
ago
a
similar
Fox
News
poll
showed
Obama's
lead
at
nine
points
49
to
40
which
certainly
gives
the
appearance
of
some
favorable
movement
in
McCain's
direction
But
it
is
Fox
News
which
as
a
rule
is
grounds
for
some
skepticism
In
this
case
the
results
are
worth
a
closer
look
One
of
Marc
Ambinder's
readers
noted
that
Fox
News
changed
its
sampling
for
this
poll
as
compared
to
last
week's
Seven
days
ago
43
of
respondents
were
Dems
and
37
were
Republicans
This
week
41
were
Dems
and
39
were
Republicans
Fewer
Dems
and
more
Republicans
will
obviously
produce
a
more
McCain-friendly
result
So
why
change
the
weighting
in
the
poll
Ambinder
asked
Pollster.com's
Mark
Blumenthal
for
his
take
He
tells
me
If
they
have
been
weighting
by
party
and
they
suddenly
changed
their
weighting
I'd
say
it's
a
pretty
questionable
practice
The
last
four
Fox
surveys
all
varied
slightly
in
terms
of
party
ID
so
I'm
not
sure
that's
what
they've
done
That
said
if
the
other
surveys
this
week
show
no
similar
shift
in
party
then
it's
probably
reasonable
to
discount
this
result
Steve
M
had
a
good
item
on
this
noting
Democrats
had
a
six-point
party-affiliation
advantage
in
the
last
poll
Now
it's
two
Anybody
think
that
in
any
way
jibes
with
reality
right
now
According
to
Gallup
that's
less
than
the
Dems
party
advantage
in
2006
or
2004
Anyone
think
they've
slipped
over
the
past
two
years
Preposterous
But
it
got
Murdoch
just
the
number
he
wanted
Something
to
keep
in
mind
when
Sean
Hannity
and
Bill
O'Reilly
trumpet
this
poll
tonight

NOT
BAD
FOR
AN
INFOMERCIAL
It's
not
my
area
of
expertise
but
these
seem
like
pretty
good
ratings
for
a
half-hour
infomercial
in
prime
time
The
combined
overall
household
rating
for
Senator
Barack
Obama's
Wednesday
night
infomercial
in
the
top
56
local
television
markets
where
Nielsen
maintains
electronic
TV
meters
was
21.7
Obama's
simulcast
is
the
first
to
be
aired
by
a
presidential
candidate
since
Ross
Perot
ran
a
political
telecast
on
Election
Day
in
1996
That
program
was
watched
by
16.8
of
all
households
nationwide
In
comparison
the
final
debate
between
the
two
presidential
candidates
received
a
38.3
household
rating
in
the
top
56
local
TV
markets
The
candidates
first
debate
on
September
26
received
a
34.7
household
rating
in
the
top
55
markets
their
second
debate
on
October
7
received
a
42.0
household
rating
in
those
markets
The
New
York
Times
added
that
the
commercial
was
particularly
high-rated
in
several
battleground
states
including
Pennsylvania
Florida
and
North
Carolina
At
this
point
we
don't
know
much
about
what
kinds
of
voters
were
watching
was
he
preaching
to
the
choir
or
were
undecided
voters
tuning
in
to
give
Obama
a
chance
For
that
matter
we
also
don't
know
if
viewers
overall
liked
what
they
saw
But
looking
solely
at
the
numbers
I'm
left
with
the
impression
that
there
are
actually
quite
a
few
Americans
interested
in
politics
this
year
Think
about
one
in
five
households
tuned
into
a
political
commercial
which
lasted
a
half-hour

AL
QAEDA
PIPES
UP
AGAIN
I
guess
one
of
these
was
bound
to
come
out
this
week
An
al
Qaeda
leader
has
called
for
President
George
W
Bush
and
the
Republicans
to
be
humiliated
without
endorsing
any
party
in
the
upcoming
U.S
presidential
election
according
to
a
video
posted
on
the
Internet
O
God
humiliate
Bush
and
his
party
O
Lord
of
the
Worlds
degrade
and
defy
him
Abu
Yahya
al-Libi
said
at
the
end
of
sermon
marking
the
Muslim
feast
of
Eid
al-Fitr
in
a
video
posted
on
the
Internet
Libi
one
of
the
top
al
Qaeda
commanders
believed
to
be
living
in
Afghanistan
or
Pakistan
called
for
God's
wrath
to
be
brought
against
Bush
equating
him
with
past
tyrants
in
history
This
news
of
course
comes
just
a
week
after
al
Qaeda
supporters
stated
their
support
for
a
McCain
victory
on
a
password-protected
website
citing
McCain's
support
for
the
Bush
administration's
foreign
policy
The
al-Hesbah
site
closely
linked
to
the
terrorist
group
added
that
al
Qaeda
will
have
to
support
McCain
and
hoped
that
a
McCain
foreign
policy
would
exhaust
American
resources
Now
to
reiterate
what
I
said
last
week
we're
talking
about
the
rantings
of
homicidal
lunatics
and
it's
ultimately
foolish
to
try
to
vote
with
terrorists
motivations
in
mind
Neither
the
al-Hesbah
message
nor
the
Abu
Yahya
al-Libi
video
are
what
a
reasonable
person
might
describe
as
sensible
political
analysis
But
that
I'm
afraid
doesn't
matter
The
al-Libi
video
is
now
the
top
story
on
Drudge
and
it
will
likely
soon
be
the
main
topic
of
conversation
on
the
far-right
blogs
and
talk
radio
The
response
from
Democrats
is
pretty
obvious
Richard
Clarke
Ron
Suskind
and
others
have
written
extensively
on
the
fact
al
Qaeda
prefers
Bush's
foreign
policy
it
helps
with
terrorist
recruiting
and
fundraising
undermines
America's
global
stature
and
costs
us
a
fortune
so
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
terrorist
network
would
support
McCain
since
his
foreign
policy
is
largely
indistinguishable
Indeed
as
Clarke
the
former
counterterrorism
coordinator
for
the
National
Security
Council
explained
earlier
this
month
al
Qaeda
wouldn't
want
an
Obama
victory
in
large
part
because
the
terrorist
network
wouldn't
want
a
U.S
president
who
enjoys
popularity
on
the
world
stage
Jonathan
Stevenson
a
professor
of
strategic
studies
at
the
U.S
Naval
War
College
told
Spencer
Ackerman
Bin
Laden
surely
would
vote
for
McCain
Bush
whose
foreign
policy
McCain
pretty
much
supported
has
been
a
recruiting
sergeant
for
Al
Qaeda
and
its
kin
The
smart
move
for
conservatives
is
drawing
attention
away
from
this
fact
not
towards
it
And
yet
I
suspect
we're
about
to
hear
a
bunch
of
unhinged
voices
screaming
See
Al
Qaeda
hates
Republicans

LIEBERMAN'S
FUTURE
Sometime
before
January
the
Senate
Democratic
caucus
will
have
to
decide
what
to
do
with
Joe
Lieberman
The
options
range
from
doing
nothing
allowing
him
to
betray
the
party
and
become
a
Republican
hack
without
consequence
or
kicking
him
out
of
the
caucus
altogether
In
between
the
two
is
stripping
Lieberman
of
his
chairmanship
which
seems
to
be
like
a
no-brainer
Members
of
the
majority
party's
leadership
have
discussed
taking
away
Lieberman's
gavel
on
the
Homeland
Security
and
Governmental
Affairs
Committee
perhaps
replacing
it
with
a
subcommittee
gavel
aides
said
Wednesday
Such
a
move
would
require
the
assent
of
the
caucus
which
won't
get
together
until
after
the
election
Aides
privy
to
the
leadership
discussions
say
that
their
bosses
view
ending
Lieberman's
chairmanship
of
a
large
committee
with
broad
oversight
authority
as
more
appropriate
retribution
than
kicking
him
out
of
the
caucus
After
all
no
matter
how
many
seats
the
Democrats
win
in
the
Senate
next
week
Lieberman's
vote
will
still
be
valuable
on
domestic
issues
like
health
care
even
though
he
disagrees
with
Democrats
on
the
war
That
sounds
relatively
compelling
but
it's
incomplete
My
suspicion
is
that
if
Lieberman
loses
his
gavel
it
would
be
effectively
be
the
same
thing
as
kicking
him
out
of
the
caucus
I
wasn't
privy
to
the
internal
discussions
but
consider
Harry
Reid
Co.'s
dealings
with
Lieberman
since
he
ran
against
the
Democratic
candidate
in
2006
The
party
wanted
his
caucus
vote
giving
the
party
51
and
Lieberman
wanted
his
committee
chairmanship
If
the
party
took
his
gavel
the
assumption
was
he'd
stroll
across
the
aisle
Lieberman
got
to
keep
his
chairmanship
and
Democrats
got
to
keep
their
51-seat
majority
Looking
ahead
the
caucus
almost
certainly
won't
have
any
incentive
to
leave
Lieberman
in
the
big
chair
in
2009
First
they'll
probably
have
a
much
bigger
majority
Second
Lieberman
has
been
an
awful
committee
chairman
And
third
Lieberman
has
to
realize
he'll
be
punished
for
his
campaign-season
conduct
My
guess
is
if
Lieberman
loses
his
committee
he'll
feel
compelled
to
spite
the
party
and
caucus
with
the
Republicans
I
guess
we'll
see
soon
enough

TAX
BREAKS
FOR
BIG
OIL
Economic
growth
may
have
fallen
into
negative
territory
but
there's
at
least
one
company
that's
doing
very
well
ExxonMobil's
third
quarter
profits
totaled
14.83
billion
the
best
quarter
any
U.S
company
has
ever
had
Like
practically
everything
else
this
has
campaign
implications
The
AP
reports
Republican
presidential
candidate
John
McCain
seized
on
reports
of
record
oil
company
profits
Thursday
to
criticize
Democratic
rival
Barack
Obama
for
favoring
tax
breaks
for
the
oil
industry
That's
not
a
typo
or
an
editing
error
The
McCain
campaign
saw
ExxonMobil's
record-breaking
profits
as
grounds
to
go
after
Obama
for
support
tax
breaks
for
Big
Oil
Honestly
how
does
one
respond
to
something
like
this
By
pointing
out
the
1.2
billion
tax
break
McCain
wants
to
give
to
ExxonMobil
By
noting
the
4
billion
in
tax
breaks
McCain
supports
for
Americaâ??s
largest
oil
companies
By
highlighting
the
fact
that
McCain's
energy
policy
reflects
Big
Oil's
wish
list
By
reminding
folks
of
McCain's
abysmal
record
on
alternative
energy
solutions
By
mentioning
that
McCain's
campaign
is
being
run
and
financed
by
lobbyists
for
the
oil
industry
An
astute
reader
named
chrenson
raised
a
good
observation
yesterday
Steve
I
think
I'm
sensing
some
desperation
in
your
closing
comments
on
these
posts
Coming
up
with
new
ways
to
express
how
very
f***ed
up
the
McCain
campaign
has
become
must
be
one
hell
of
a
burden
Especially
since
each
instance
of
bulls**t
way
outdoes
the
one
before
Chrenson's
right
It's
one
thing
to
point
out
some
of
the
absurdities
of
the
presidential
campaign
but
it's
altogether
more
challenging
to
find
different
adjectives
that
sufficiently
capture
the
madness
emanating
from
McCain
campaign
headquarters
Reading
today
that
McCain
is
going
after
Obama
on
tax
breaks
for
Big
Oil
is
just
the
latest
evidence
that
the
Republican
presidential
ticket
is
engaged
in
some
kind
of
satirical
performance
art
and
I'm
just
not
in
on
the
joke

PRECONDITIONS
The
new
McCain
campaign
ad
argues
that
Obama
will
negotiate
with
Ahmadinejad
about
the
elimination
of
Israel
and
the
withdrawal
of
all
U.S
troops
from
every
country
in
the
Middle
East
It
is
as
Andrew
Sullivan
accurately
noted
disgusting
stupid
inflammatory
and
in
its
use
of
Arabic-sounding
music
bigoted
I
was
planning
to
break
it
down
and
tear
it
apart
but
it
looks
like
Joe
Klein
beat
me
to
it
There
is
so
much
desperate
crapulous
spew
from
the
McCain
campaign
right
now
that
it's
hard
to
keep
track
of
it
all
but
this
ad
via
Andrew
Sullivan
marks
some
sort
of
low
Yet
again
in
a
last
desperate
attempt
to
scare
the
elderly
Jews
of
Florida
McCain
posits
Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad
as
the
leader
of
Iran
even
though
he
has
no
control
over
Iranian
foreign
or
military
policy
Ayatullah
Ali
Khamenei
is
the
guy
in
charge
in
Iran
which
is
why
they
call
him
you
guessed
it
the
Supreme
Leader
Yet
again
McCain
brings
up
the
notion
of
preconditions
only
now
the
preconditions
are
Ahmadinejad's
namely
that
the
U.S
would
have
to
leave
the
Middle
East
before
he'd
be
willing
to
talk
It's
all
inflammatory
nonsense
of
course
Obama
has
said
that
he
would
meet
with
the
Iranian
leadership
without
preconditions
namely
the
Bush
Administration
requirement
that
the
Iranians
stop
processing
uranium
Of
course
the
Bush
Administration
doesn't
seem
so
set
on
that
precondition
anymore
either
Again
this
is
a
purposeful
effort
to
mislead
on
Obama's
actual
position
he
would
begin
lower-level
negotiations
with
the
Iranians
and
see
how
much
progress
could
be
made
That
is
a
position
supported
by
many
of
McCain's
own
diplomatic
supporters
But
that's
not
really
what
this
is
all
about
this
ad
with
its
Middle
Eastern
music
is
all
about
implying
that
Obama
isn't
one
of
us
that
he's
one
of
them
It
is
shameful
in
the
extreme
It's
also
really
bad
policy
I'd
just
add
one
tangential
thought
to
this
There's
going
to
come
a
point
probably
in
a
couple
of
weeks
at
which
John
McCain
is
going
to
express
some
kind
of
regret
for
just
how
disgusting
his
campaign
became
He'll
do
this
if
he
wins
hoping
to
generate
some
pre-inauguration
goodwill
and
he'll
do
this
is
he
loses
hoping
to
improve
his
tarnished
and
discredited
legacy
McCain
will
probably
say
with
apparent
sincerity
that
things
got
out
of
hand
and
he's
filled
with
regret
for
not
having
intervened
before
his
campaign
became
too
pathetic
But
an
ad
as
offensive
as
this
new
one
shouldn't
be
forgotten
or
forgiven
McCain
under
pressure
is
putting
his
character
on
the
line
for
all
to
see
and
post
hoc
remorse
should
be
irrelevant
McCain
had
a
choice
lose
his
honor
or
lose
the
election
Whether
he
ends
up
losing
both
remains
to
be
seen
but
either
way
McCain
did
not
choose
wisely
