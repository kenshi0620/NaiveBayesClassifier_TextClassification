MAKES
NO
SENSE
I
keep
seeing
news
reports
about
what
provisions
of
the
Wall
Street
bailout
Hank
Paulson
has
or
has
not
agreed
But
to
be
blunt
about
it
Who
cares
Does
anyone
honestly
believe
that
if
Congress
comes
up
with
a
bailout
plan--any
bailout
plan
at
all--clocking
in
at
several
hundred
billion
dollars
President
Bush
is
going
to
veto
it
What
Paulson
thinks
is
thankfully
irrelevant
Congress
should
figure
out
if
passing
a
plan
would
be
a
good
idea
if
so
what
plan
would
be
best
and
then
Congress
should
pass
that
plan
Looking
at
it
any
other
way
makes
no
sense

Maybe

all
along
But
the

OBAMA
IT'S
NO

Recently
posted
on

Thus
far
the

has
only
offered
a
concept
with
a
staggering
price

not
a

Even
if
the
Treasury
recovers
some
or
most
of
its
investment
over

this
initial
outlay
of
up
to
700
billion
is
sobering
And
in
return
for
their
support
the
American
people
must
be
assured
that
the
deal
reflects
some
basic
principles.He
goes
on
to
enumerate
a
whole
bunch
of
sensible

But
will
he
have
the
courage
to
stick
his
neck
out
on

Even
as
Sen

be
bowing

THIS
IS
MADNESS
Giving

700
billion
to
do
what
he
pleases
with
is
insane
It's
the
same
as
the
Iraq
war--and
roughly
the
same
price--but
instead
of
carnage
and
destruction
we're
just
skipping
straight
to
the
part
where
we
give
all
the
loot
to
the
powerful
and
well-connected
That's
not
to
say
federal
intervention
isn't

It
sounds

is
But
putting
the
former
head
of
Goldman

in

of
the
mother
of
all
taxpayer
sponsored
slush
funds--for
him
to
dole
out
to

Wall

in

worse

LISTEN
TO
DeLONG
An
economist
from
the
Clinton
administration
speaks
The
decisions
that
will
be
made
this
weekend
matter
not
just
to
the
prospects
of
the
U.S
economy
in
the
year
to
come
they
will
shape
the
type
of
capitalism
we
will
live
in
for
the
next
fifty
years
Do
we
want
to
live
in
a
system
where
profits
are
private
but
losses
are
socialized
Where
taxpayer
money
is
used
to
prop
up
failed
firms
Or
do
we
want
to
live
in
a
system
where
people
are
held
responsible
for
their
decisions
where
imprudent
behavior
is
penalized
and
prudent
behavior
rewarded
For
somebody
like
me
who
believes
strongly
in
the
free
market
system
the
most
serious
risk
of
the
current
situation
is
that
the
interest
of
few
financiers
will
undermine
the
fundamental
workings
of
the
capitalist
system
The
time
has
come
to
save
capitalism
from
the

WSJ
ON
RACE
The
Wall
Street
Journal
wades
into
the
gutter--and
very
close
to
the
cesspool
of
racism--in
a
bizarre
Saturday
op-Ed
from
Jon
Keller
The
conceit
of
the
piece
titled
President
Obama
The
Preview
is
this
There
may
not
be
two
politicians
on
the
national
stage
more
alike
than
Barack
Obama
and
Massachusetts
Gov
Deval
Patrick
Both
went
to
Harvard
Law
are
African-American
politicians
with
mass
appeal
and
use
soaring
rhetoric
to
promise
a
bold
new
postpartisan
politics.The
piece
proceeds
to
catalog
Patrick's
supposed
failures
and
to
suggest--with
no
justification
beyond
what's
in
the
above
paragraph--that
Obama
would
make
similar
mistakes
But
plenty
of
politicians
in
this
country--former
Gov
Eliot
Spitzer
and
Sen
Chuck
Schumer
D-NY
come
immediately
to
mind--went
to
Harvard
Law
School
And
literally
dozens
of
pols
on
the
national
scene
use
soaring
rhetoric
and
promise
bold
new
postpartisan
politics
So
how
does
Keller
reach
the
conclusion
that
Obama
and
Patrick
are
political
twins
And
that
Patrick's
record
is
a
preview
of
what
an
Obama
presidency
would
look
like
Clearly
the
decisive
factor
is
that
they're
both
African-American
politicians
with
mass
appeal
Although
it's
not
clear
how
mass
appeal
figures
into
the
equation
So
would
editors
at
the
WSJ
allow
a
writer
to
lump
together
as
near-facsimiles
two
Jewish
politicians
on
the
basis
of
their
Jewishness
Would
they
allow
this
kind
of
guilt-by-ethnicity
smear
with
two
Catholic
candidates
or
two
Americans
of
Polish
descent
Of
course
not
Disgusting

LET
ME
SAY
THIS
On
the
Rev
Jeremiah
Wright
matter
I've
seen
several
bits
of
commentary
over
the
last
several
weeks
accusing
Democrats
of
hypocrisy
for
complaining
about
all
the
Wright
coverage
even
though
lefties
have
regularly
criticized
Republicans
for
their
relationships
with
people
like
Jerry
Falwell
Pat
Robertson
and
more
recently
John
Hagee
But
this
is
apples
and
oranges
The
problem
with
conservatives
cozying
up
to
the
Pat
Robertsons
and
John
Hagees
of
the
world
is
that
Republicans
go
to
these
people
specifically
seeking
their
political
imprimatur
A
Robertson
endorsement
is
coveted
not
in
spite
of
but
because
of
the
controversial
things
he's
said
and
the
fact
that
a
constituency
exists
which
endorses
his
political
views
Whatever
you
think
about
the
Wright-Obama
relationship
it's
clearly
never
been
about
that

DECEIVES
READERS
The
headline
Big
Wins
for
Clinton
in
Texas
and
Ohio
The
sixth
sentence
And
the
result
there
allowed
her
to
cast
Tuesday
as
the
beginning
of
a
comeback
even
though
she
stood
a
good
chance
of
gaining
no
ground
against
Mr
Obama
in
the
hunt
for
delegates.(Emphasis

The
currency
of
the
nomination
process
is
delegates
How
a
candidate
could
have
a
win
that's
big
without
gaining
delegates
goes
unexplained
From
the
twelfth
paragraph
Given
the
way
the
Democratic
Party
allocates
delegates
it
remained
unclear
whether
Mrs
Clinton
would
close
Mr
Obama's
lead
on
that
front.But
to
reiterate
That
is
the
only
front
The
New

could
use
its
prestige
and
influence
to
correct
a
misleading
bit
of
conventional
wisdom
that
has
cropped
up
in
the

days
Instead
the
paper
sacrifices
accuracy
so
that
it
can
stick
with
the
crowd
UPDATE
From
the
sixth
paragraph
of
an
article--also
touting
Clinton's
victories"--that
The
Times
gives
less
prominence
Mr
Obama
meanwhile
appeared
likely
to
accumulate
enough
delegates
from
Texas
and
Ohio
as
well
as
from
his
victory
in
Vermont
to
strengthen
his
mathematical
edge
for
the

LOSES
ITS
MIND
Check
out
this
passage
from
a
Wednesday
editorial
Mr
Obama's
campaign
often
seems
to
teeter
on
becoming
a
cult
of
personality--a
feeling
that
the
candidate
and
those
around
him
do
nothing
to
dispel
In
an
interview
with
ABC's
Good
Morning
America
on
Monday
Mr
Obama's
wife
Michelle
was
asked
if
she
would
work
to
support
Mrs
Clinton
if
she
won
I'd
have
to
think
about
that
she
replied
Mrs
Obama
quickly
got
back
on
her
talking
points
stressing
party
unity
But
her
unguarded
answer
was
similar
to
what
we
heard
from
Obama
supporters
in
e-mail
messages
that
we
received
after
endorsing
Mrs
Clinton
Many
of
those
readers
said
they
would
not
bother
to
vote
if
Mr
Obama
lost
the
nomination
That
is
not
the
way
democracy
is
supposed
to
work.Three
points
First
The
Obama
cult
of
personality
Are
you
kidding
Is
this
The
New
York
Times
or
Rush
Limbaugh
I
have
literally
no
idea
what
The
Times
is
referring
to
here--and
I've
been
watching
this
race
very
closely
Are
many
Obama
supporters
passionate
Clearly
Though
not
nearly
as
passionate
as
were
Howard
Dean's
core
supporters
But
painting
that
enthusiasm
as
cult-like
is
sloppy
histrionic
and
irresponsible
Second
It's
especially
sloppy
given
the
meager
evidence
The
Times
produces
That
the
paper
got
a
few
nasty
e-mails
and
that
Michelle
Obama
said
that
she
might
not
work
to
support
Hillary
Clinton
as
nominee
How
this
kind
of
off-hand
comment
proves
anything
is
utterly
beyond
me
Third
Regarding
the
assertion
That
is
not
the
way
democracy
is
supposed
to
work
If
Sen
Clinton
is
the
nominee
I
will
tell
any
Obama
supporter
that
it
would
be
a
serious
dangerous
mistake
not
to
support
her
But
sitting
out
the
election
would
not
be
as
The
Times
posits
an
affront
to
democracy
People
should
vote
their
consciences
The
idea
that
doing
so
might
be
undemocratic
is
madness
The
Times
should
know
better

NAGOURNEY
ABDICATES
Witness
Thus
the
big
question
is
how
much
attention
to
pay
to
the
results
map
on
television--lighted
up
with
say
states
that
have
swung
to
Senator
John
McCain's
column--and
how
much
attention
to
pay
to
the
delegate
counter
The
answer
is
pay
attention
to
both
though
put
somewhat
more
focus
on
states
for
the
Republicans
and
put
somewhat
more
on
delegates
for
the
Democrats
The
delegate
count
might
matter
more
officially
but
the
state
results
could
count
more
politically
and
that
will
be
the
central
tension
of
the
night
Nagourney
has
a
seat--a
big
seat--at
the
table
when
it
comes
to
determining
what
could
count
more
politically
But
instead
of
using
that
seat
to
trumpet
the
truth
he
hews
to
a
fuzzy
sloppy
pundit
consensus
So
let's
be
clear
Delegates
are
the
only
thing
that
matters
And
so
the
only
way
for
state
results
to
have
an
impact
is
if
they
wind
up
influencing
delegate
totals
The
most
likely
way
for
that
to
happen
of
course
is
if
lazy
reporters
mischaracterize
the
situation
in
way
that
distorts
the
races
and
ultimately
influences
results
In
his
article
Nagourney
has
already
done
what
he
could
toward
that
