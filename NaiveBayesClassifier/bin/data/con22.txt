On

The
New

Times
ran
a
front
page
article
that
began
A
comprehensive
review
of
the
uncounted
Florida
ballots
from
last
year's
presidential
election
reveals
that
George
W
Bush
would
have
won
even
if
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
had
allowed
the
statewide
manual
recount
of
the
votes
that
the
Florida
Supreme
Court
had

to

Another
Times
article
that
day
by
Richard
L
Berke
said
that
the
comprehensive
review
of
the
uncounted
Florida
ballots
solidifies
George
W
Bush's
legal
claim
on
the
White
House
because
it
concludes
that
he
would
have
won
under
the
ground
rules
prescribed
by
the
Democrats

notorious
pro-abortion
zealot
Linda
Greenhouse
wrote
in
the
Times
that
the
media
consortium's
count
of
all
the
disputed
Florida
ballots
in
which
the
Times
participated
concluded
that
George
W
Bush
would
have
won
the
2000
presidential
election
even
had
the
court
not
cut
the
final
recount
short
If
three

isn't

SORT
OF
A
few
comments
about
Ann
Coulter's
remark
regarding
Presidential
candidate
John
Edwards
1
The
use
of
the
word
faggot
was
inappropriate
although
as
commonly
and
mistakenly
noted
she
did
not
say
John
Edwards
is
a
faggot
2
It
would
have
been
significantly
and
newsworthily
inappropriate
if
John
Edwards
were
actually
GAY
3
It
was
not
an
anti-gay
slur
She
did
not
attack
homosexuals
She
made
light
of
John
Edwards
tendency
to
preen
more
aggressively
than
most
gay
fashion
icons

ANOTHER
INCONVENIENT
FACT
GORE
INCREASED
POWER
CONSUMPTION
AFTER
GLOBAL
WARMING
DOCUMENTARY
From
DRUDGE
The
Tennessee
Center
for

Research
an
independent
nonprofit
and
nonpartisan
research
organization
committed
to
achieving
a
freer
more
prosperous
Tennessee
through
free
market
policy
solutions
issued
a
press
release
late
Monday
Last
night
Al
Gore's
global-warming
documentary
An
Inconvenient
Truth
collected
an
Oscar
for
best
documentary
feature
but
the
Tennessee
Center
for
Policy
Research
has
found
that
Gore
deserves
a
gold
statue
for
hypocrisy
Gore's
mansion
20-room
eight-bathroom
located
in
the
posh
Belle
Meade
area
of
Nashville
consumes
more
electricity
every
month
than
the
average
American
household
uses
in
an
entire
year
according
to
the
Nashville
Electric
Service
NES
In
his
documentary
the
former
Vice
President
calls
on
Americans
to
conserve
energy
by
reducing
electricity
consumption
at
home
The
average
household
in
America
consumes
10,656
kilowatt-hours
kWh
per
year
according
to
the
Department
of
Energy
In
2006
Gore
devoured
nearly
221,000
kWh
more
than
20
times
the
national
average
Last
August
alone
Gore
burned
through
22,619
kWh
guzzling
more
than
twice
the
electricity
in
one
month
than
an
average
American
family
uses
in
an
entire
year
As
a
result
of
his
energy
consumption
Gore's
average
monthly
electric
bill
topped
1,359
Since
the
release
of
An
Inconvenient
Truth
Gore's
energy
consumption
has
increased
from
an
average
of
16,200
kWh
per
month
in
2005
to
18,400
kWh
per
month
in
2006
Gore's
extravagant
energy
use
does
not
stop
at
his
electric
bill
Natural
gas
bills
for
Gore's
mansion
and
guest
house
averaged
1,080
per
month
last
year
As
the
spokesman
of
choice
for
the

movement
Al
Gore
has

PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE
GREATEST
THREAT
IS
ISRAEL
According
to
Jon
Edwards
the
greatest
short-term
threat
to
the
world
is
the
Zionist
entity
known
to
the
Edwards
and
his
ilk
as
Palestine
There
are
other
emerging
fissures
as
well
The
aggressively
photogenic
John
Edwards
was
cruising
along
detailing
his
litany
of
liberal
causes
last
week
until
during
question
time
he
invoked
the
I
word
Israel
Perhaps
the
greatest
short-term
threat
to
world
peace
Edwards
remarked
was
the
possibility
that
Israel
would
bomb
Iran's
nuclear
facilities
As

chill
descended
on
the
gathering
the
Edwards
event
