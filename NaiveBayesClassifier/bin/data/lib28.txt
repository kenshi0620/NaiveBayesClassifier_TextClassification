A
while
ago
Robert
Reich
had
a
blog
post
up
regarding
the
upcoming
now
hopefully
in
progress
swing
from
liaise
faire
capitalism
where
things
have
been
for
the
last
30
years
or
so
back
towards
another
era
of
more
regulation
He
ends
his
post
with
a
typical
centrist
sentiment
Now
the
pendulum
of
outrage
is
swinging
back
against
large
corporations
America
is
heading
toward
another
era
of
regulation
The
real
question
is
how
smartly
we
go
about
it
and
whether
we
can
keep
the
pendulum
from
swinging
too
far
Again
Reich
wrote
this
before
the
great
and
still
far
from
over
disaster
of
the
last
2
weeks
In
any
kind
of
sane
world
where
we
have
just
experienced
the
entire
meltdown
of
the
entire
global
economy
there
would
expected
to
be
a
back
lash
And
boo
hoo
to
those
who
are
concerned
that
the
reaction
swings
too
far
But
clearly
Reich
didn't
have
much
to
be
concerned
about
given
the
way
things
seem
to
be
shaking
out
The
Bush
administration
on
Saturday
formally
proposed
to
Congress
what
could
become
the
largest
financial
bailout
in
United
States
history
requesting
unfettered
authority
for
the
Treasury
Department
to
buy
up
to
700
billion
in
mortgage-related
assets
The
proposal
not
quite
three
pages
long
was
stunning
for
its
stark
simplicity
It
would
raise
the
national
debt
ceiling
to
11.3
trillion
And
it
would
place
no
restrictions
on
the
administration
other
than
requiring
semiannual
reports
to
Congress
granting
the
Treasury
secretary
unprecedented
power
to
buy
and
resell
mortgage
debt
Please
read
these
two
paragraphs
again
I'll
wait
Done
Pick
your
jaw
off
the
floor
I
mean
the
700
billion
dollars
is
a
figure
almost
unimaginable
for
one
The
11.3
trillion
dollars
of
debt
we're
going
to
have
after
this
almost
10
of
this
was
added
just
by
this
fiasco
I'll
note
is
truly
a
number
that
defies
imagination
But
that
really
isn't
the
stunning
part
The
stunning
party
is
requesting
unfettered
authority
for
the
Treasury
Department
Yes
Unfettered
authority
For
the
Bush
administration
Apparently
having
the
unfettered
authority
that
they
read
Cheney
claimed
because
of
9/11
wasn't
quite
unfettered
enough
Now
they
simply
want
the
authority
to
spend
almost
a
trillion
dollars
and
god
knows
I'm
sure
that
the
amount
they
currently
want
isn't
going
to
be
enough
it
never
is
Got
to
admit
they
have
some
pretty
big
brass
balls
Your
Typical
Financial
Disaster
Apologist
But
really
the
pair
that
Hank
Paulsen
is
strapping
on
simply
doesn't
compare
to
the
planetary
sized
balls
that
the
collective
financial
wizards
are
in
the
process
of
strapping
on
after
all
such
balls
will
greatly
affect
your
gait
and
require
a
new
wardrobe
to
accommodate
them
What
seems
to
be
shaping
up
as
the
explanation
for
this
multi-trillion
dollar
meltdown
in
our
economy
and
the
subsequent
multi-trillion
dollar
bailout
again
I
need
only
point
out
that
700
billion
is
simply
the
first
installment
Paulsen
will
be
asking
for
and
this
is
only
what
the
USA
itself
is
shoveling
into
this
gaping
maw
is
that
the
reason
why
things
are
so
fucked
up
the
reason
why
everything
went
south
is
Wait
for
it
Government
regulation
Yes
that's
right
folks
The
reason
why
we're
having
a
melt
down
on
a
global
scale
the
reason
why
we're
pouring
sums
of
money
that
boggle
the
imagination
down
the
toilet
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
plug
the
hole
these
wizards
of
Wall
Street
have
blasted
through
our
global
financial
system
is
simply
because
they
were
regulated
too
much
See
what
happened
is
that
the
poor
fellows
in
the
financial
community
were
forced
forced
I
say
to
create
almost
unbelievably
complicated
financial
pretzels
based
on
obviously
worthless
loans
that
would
never
ever
be
repaid
is
because
the
government
regulations
forced
them
to
Forced
I
mean
geebus
Paulsen
has
nothing
on
these
jokers
who
are
going
to
start
pushing
this
pile
of
bullshit
Back
in
the
old
days
it
used
to
be
that
when
someone
offered
you
a
deal
that
was
obviously
bogus
we'd
reply
yes
and
I
have
a
bridge
I'd
like
to
sell
you
in
Brooklyn
Now
a
days
selling
someone
repeatedly
mind
you
the
Brooklyn
Bridge
is
simply
a
consequence
of
over
burdensome
government
regulations
I
guess
we've
reached
the
point
in
our
evolution
where
The
Great
Filter
is
about
to
be
invoked
I
mean
seriously
If
we
let
these
bozos
get
away
with
this
then
we
simply
cannot
believe
that
we're
fit
for
extraterrestrial
expansion
I
have
a
feeling
that
the
aliens
watching
this
hilarious
sit
com
we've
been
putting
on
for
them
must
feel
the
same
way
I
think
the
absolute
last
thing
they
want
running
around
the
galaxy
is
a
bunch
of
dufuses
who
are
too
stupid
to
responsibly
regulate
their
own
economy
and
a
species
that
always
ends
up
holding
the
bag
for
a
tiny
fraction
of
their
own
which
ends
up
fleecing
the
rest

An
Observation
There
seem
to
be
a
non
trivial
percentage
of
women
who
look
far
better
without
clothes
than
when
wearing
them
Naturally
as
a
good
liberal
I
blame
the
patriarchal
culture
that
dominates
our
lives
However
I
must
say
that
poor
fashion
choices
seem
to
also
account
for
an
unnerving
percentage
of
these
data
points
Again
I
blame
society
Self
image
is
largely
shaped
by
peer
perception
and
mass
media
is
our
peer
perception
in
these
modern
times
Although
the
repressed
libertarian
in
me
don't
worry
I'm
doing
my
best
to
eradicate
it
can't
help
but
wonder
if
a
mirror
or
two
might
help
matters
Doesn't
matter
when
they've
shed
their
clothes
of
course
but
still
One
would
think
that
observing
the
ill
fitting
clothes
in
a
reflection
would
lead
to
better
fashion
choices
in
the
long
run

Okay
I'll
confess
Just
give
me
the
papers
to
sign
Please
make
it
stop
I
must
be
well
into
my
fourth
day
of
sensory
deprivation
because
I've
seemingly
passed
the
hallucination
stage
blew
right
past
the
psychotic
stage
of
the
second
day
and
have
been
transported
a
place
where
newspaper
taxis
appear
on
the
shore
waiting
to
take
me
away
For
example
I
don't
think
that
I
could
have
ever
in
a
million
zillion
years
made
up
both
the
post
and
especially
the
comments
over
at
the
BreakingWindOfChange
First
off
the
moniker
Armed
Liberal
has
always
made
me
snort
milk
through
my
nose
everytime
I
actually
see
it
in
black
and
white
And
following
the
joker
for
the
past
5
years
or
so
seems
like
an
eternity
believe
me
I
have
to
say
that
he
really
gets
better
and
better
at
his
gig
the
longer
he's
at
it
One
of
the
commenters
there
does
us
all
a
favor
and
nicely
sums
up
the
ArmedLiberal
snort
for
anyone
who's
coming
to
this
party
late
and
is
wondering
what
all
the
laughing
is
about
There's
more
of
course
but
those
comments
aren't
the
hillarious
ones
The
hillarious
ones
are
from
the
AL
himself
sorry
I
am
drinking
a
Sierra
Mist
and
the
carbonated
water
hurts
my
nose
My
favorite
is
Steve
really
You
don't
think
Althouse
or
Reynolds
talk
to
an
audience
that
could
vote
for
Obama
I
certainly
think
they
do
and
that
reaching
that
audience
ought
to
be
a
really
damn
high
priority
for
the
party
Again
I'm
snorting
up
my
Sierra
Mist
I
simply
love
how
the
only
way
that
liberals
can
survive
is
if
they
somehow
find
someway
to
pander
to
people
who
literally
would
gnaw
off
their
own
arm
before
voting
for
them
Brilliant
But
really
what
could
possibly
compare
to
the
triple
threat
posed
by
the
McMegan/Althouse/Drum
trinity
McMegan
and
Althouse
were
both
expertly
skewered
in
the
piece
by
Roy
the
man
and
naturally
their
feelings
were
very
hurt
All
this
is
to
be
expected
naturally
by
a
piece
of
sardonic
wit
But
then
Kevin
Drum
our
favorite
slightly
left
of
center
liberal
demonstrates
the
keen
insight
and
tenacious
capacity
to
dig
into
the
heart
of
an
issue
which
led
to
his
support
of
the
Iraq
war
has
to
pile
on
in
a
more
utterly
clueless
fashion
than
usual
apparently
buying
McMegan's
whiny
post
about
sexism
in
the
blogosphere
as
the
god's
honest
truth
As
Roy
points
out
in
his
live
blogging
of
the
reaction
to
the
VV
piece
McMegan's
follow
up
is
simply
priceless
McUpdate
Yes
I
know
the
many
uses
of
the
phrase
lipstick
lesbian
indeed
I
count
several
as
friends
and
loved
ones
Yet
in
my
mouth
it's
a
horrible
slur
Either
I
poison
everything
I
touch
the
theory
endorsed
by
my
family
and
ex-girlfriends
or
victim
status
is
the
new
Gold
Standard
And
that's
what
I
think
has
finally
convinced
me
that
I
must
be
on
my
fourth
day
of
sleep
deprivation
Teh
Victim
Status
I
mean
really
This
is
the
Village
Voice
McMegan
can
ho-hum
Torture
memos
coming
from
the
very
heart
of
this
government
but
my
lord
A
frank
look
in
the
mirror
provided
by
Roy
in
the
Village
Voice
Bring
the
ambulance
And
to
have
Kevin
Drum
fall
hook
line
and
sinker
for
her
drivel
is
simply
bliss
beyond
compare
One
of
the
most
inexplicable
tropes
of
the
liberal
blogosphere
is
its
howling
disdain
for
Megan
I
guess
it
all
goes
back
to
the
moronic
two-by-four
controversy
but
it
really
ought
to
stop
She
writes
a
perfectly
sane
opinionated
moderately
libertarian
occasionally
obsessive
sometimes
provocative
blog
I
don't
often
agree
with
her
and
at
times
I
find
her
maddeningly
obtuse
but
I'm
sure
she
feels
the
same
about
me
In
other
words
she's
a
totally
normal
blogger
Michelle
Malkin
she
ain't
Totally
normal
dude
And
people
wonder
why
mentally
deficient
urchins
like
David
Brooks
rise
to
the
top
in
Drum's
world
Okay
back
to
my
regularly
scheduled
psychosis
Just
had
to
share
this
gem
with
y'all
in
case
you
were
encased
in
concrete
living
in
total
sensory
deprivation
like
I
am

Exactly
How
Is
The
Olympics
Not
Political
Now
that
I've
been
rousted
out
of
my
comfy
chair
by
the
swift
effects
of
the
cocaine
like
high
I
get
from
a
Drezner/McMegen
bashing
I
mine
as
well
blog
about
this
other
piece
of
gum
that's
been
sticking
to
my
shoe
for
the
past
week
or
so
before
I
return
to
my
peaceful
slumber
Lately
there's
been
the
enormous
spectacle
of
the
Olympic
Torch
bravely
traveling
the
world
as
it
makes
its
way
to
Bejing
for
this
year's
Olympic
festivities
Apparently
Bejing's
crackdown
on
Tibet
hasn't
gone
over
that
well
with
pretty
much
everyone
except
Dan
Drezner
and
McMegan
who
are
wondering
what
all
the
petty
fussing
is
about
I
mean
it's
really
just
quite
comical
how
Bejing
thinks
that
they
knock
a
few
monks
around
before
the
torch
shows
up
on
their
doorstep
and
no
one
will
notice
Bizarre
In
any
event
what
I
found
truly
odd
was
the
way
controversies
of
this
type
are
always
portrayed
by
the
defenders
of
the
Olympics
In
a
nutshell
the
argument
is
simply
that
the
Olympic
Games
are
above
politics
and
should
like
Justice
blind
to
whatever
is
going
on
in
that
terribly
dreary
world
of
politics
Let
the
god
like
Athletes
shine
as
they
are
meant
to
without
being
dragged
down
to
earth
and
the
mud
like
the
rest
of
us
After
all
the
Olympics
are
about
Unity
Capiche
But
really
when
haven't
the
Olympics
been
nothing
but
politics
I
seem
to
recall
that
the
modern
revival
of
the
Olympic
games
was
when
Hitler
used
them
as
Germany's
coming
out
party
Then
there's
the
gazillion
times
that
national
pride
in
the
USSR
was
restored
by
the
manly
athletic
prowess
of
their
women's
swim
team
well
until
the
steroid
scandals
And
god
only
knows
how
apolitical
the
Olympics
was
when
the
Israeli
athletes
were
gunned
down
by
Arabs
in
the
70's
But
I
suppose
that
one
can
really
look
at
these
examples
too
numerous
to
count
and
come
away
with
an
even
stronger
conclusion
that
politics
should
be
kept
out
of
the
Olympics
However
is
there
any
more
political
of
a
process
than
the
selection
of
a
host
country
and
city
I
mean
besides
from
the
cash
involved
there's
this
huge
prestige
thing
In
China's
case
it's
obviously
their
version
of
a
Debutante
ball
in
which
the
blushing
vixen
is
presented
to
the
world
in
her
coming
out
party
It's
a
big
We're
here
to
the
whole
world
demonstrating
that
they
are
truly
a
player
in
todays
world
How's
that
not
100
political
And
so
it's
with
a
smirk
on
my
face
that
I
watch
the
protestations
of
the
Olympic
defenders
of
purity
It's
clear
that
the
games
were
born
in
politics
sustained
by
politics
and
thrive
in
politics
and
fuel
politics
To
believe
otherwise
is
somewhat
akin
to
believing
in
the
tooth
fairy
a
quaint
tale
to
pass
on
to
the
children
but
not
something
that
anyone
with
an
IQ
over
90
believes

Oh
Boo
Fucking
Hoo
I
meant
to
blog
about
this
earlier
but
being
the
lazy
SOB
that
I
most
certainly
am
I
felt
that
sitting
back
for
a
bit
cracking
open
a
Guinness
and
watching
the
fallout
would
be
good
for
a
few
laughs
So
this
morning
I
stumbled
across
Mona's
comment
on
it
all
which
is
more
like
the
opening
scene
from
Hamburger
Hill
as
is
her
wont
Mona
is
a
fierce
admirer
of
Greenwald
and
is
as
loyal
of
a
friend
as
apparently
they
make
these
days
So
when
you
attack
Glenn
Greenwald
you're
going
to
feel
Mona's
teeth
sink
into
your
hind
quarters
and
she
will
not
let
go
until
she
pulls
you
down
and
tastes
the
blood
gushing
from
the
throat
she
just
ripped
out
of
you
At
issue
is
that
Daniel
Drezner
and
Little
Miss
McMegan
feel
that
Glenn
has
been
terribly
unfair
to
them
both
in
his
rather
long
screed
in
which
he
places
them
both
front
and
center
as
object
lessons
as
to
why
the
main
stream
media
is
so
fucked
up
I
had
read
the
post
Drezner
squeezed
out
between
venti
mochas
and
about
half
way
through
it
my
own
mocha
was
splurting
out
my
nose
as
I
was
laughing
at
the
kind
of
half
assed
way
that
Drezner
was
trying
to
compose
an
argument
Because
rather
than
an
argument
what
Drezner
invariably
does
is
really
more
of
a
high
brow
sneer
with
some
flimsy
veneer
as
he
dashes
off
to
somewhere
terribly
important
Little
Miss
McMegan's
response
I'm
sad
to
say
has
not
graced
the
monitor
of
my
bitchin
Mac
Book
Pro
nor
has
the
pixels
of
my
incredibly
cool
iPhone
been
manipulated
by
the
utterly
innane
ramblings
of
someone
just
a
little
more
intellectually
advanced
than
Paris
Hilton
and
not
nearly
as
hot
I've
found
that
my
IQ
level
literally
drops
10
points
whenever
I
inadvertently
read
a
sentence
or
two
of
hers
that
someone
has
quoted
as
they
laugh
at
what
passes
for
logical
thought
in
McMegan's
head
And
seeing
as
how
I'm
just
about
topping
off
at
the
low
grade
moron
level
I
really
can't
afford
to
lose
those
IQ
points
even
if
it's
only
temporary
In
any
event
Drezner's
response
certainly
is
a
prize
and
a
classic
model
of
what
can
only
be
described
as
an
adolescent
hissy
fit
I
mean
here's
the
rub
If
you
really
think
that
someone
isn't
worth
your
effort
to
respond
to
and
that
you
think
they
really
are
being
such
a
jerk
that
you're
not
going
to
bother
with
them
ever
again
then
you
simply
you
know
just
shut
up
ignore
them
don't
respond
and
never
look
back
in
the
mirror
at
them
If
you
don't
then
it's
simply
painfully
obvious
that
you
DO
care
about
them
you
DON'T
want
to
ignore
them
and
you're
only
responding
because
your
feelings
are
hurt
and
you
want
to
lash
back
out
at
them
and
give
them
a
smack
or
two
to
let
them
know
how
hurt
you
are
Dan's
response
is
essentially
a
real
life
enactment
of
the
little
boy
blue
who's
crying
out
that
he's
going
to
take
his
ball
and
go
home
because
everyone
is
so
mean
McMegan's
response
is
significantly
more
manly
from
what
I
can
tell
than
Drezner's
Again
not
surprising
as
she
wears
the
pants
in
their
relationship
hey
they
walk
each
other
home
according
to
Dan's
post
so
they
be
cozy
As
she
is
wont
to
do
whenever
someone
points
out
the
obvious
fallacies
of
what
ever
the
fuck
she
is
squeezing
out
on
her
blog
she
drops
back
into
this
pseudo
intellectual
pose
and
provides
the
mirror
image
of
Drezner's
response
She
stomps
her
high
heel
down
on
a
picture
of
Greenwald
and
pulls
out
the
Pajamas
Media
Response
Kit
and
uses
Wing
Nut
Defense
tactic
275
That
being
of
course
the
assertion
that
Glenn
Greenwald
is
really
just
a
very
angry
liberal
who's
really
even
more
self
obsessed
than
McMegan
and
Drezner
Then
she
goes
back
to
filing
her
nails
In
any
event
it's
actually
pretty
fascinating
to
see
what
Drezner
thinks
is
serious
self
criticism
that
doesn't
pull
any
punches
about
his
position
on
the
war
with
Iraq
I
remember
quite
vividly
the
whole
evolution
of
Dan's
terribly
serious
position
as
his
baby
unraveled
in
the
hands
of
frickin
incompetent
bastards
who
can't
even
wage
a
war
right
I
think
my
favorite
high
point
was
when
he
held
a
debate
between
Sebastian
Holsclaw
and
some
other
dude
regarding
whether
or
not
the
administration
had
used
the
phrase
imminent
threat
or
not
The
whole
spectacle
was
truly
a
performance
art
that
has
never
been
topped
since
It
was
in
a
nutshell
the
perfect
symbolic
essence
of
the
entire
fiasco
A
masterpiece
And
it
happened
under
Drezner's
tender
care
Myself
I
also
found
it
so
very
appropriate
that
Dan
was
the
dude
who
came
up
with
the
idea
I
mean
imagine
if
someone
had
had
the
foresight
during
the
Clinton
impeachment
trial
to
have
a
high
profile
blog
debate
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
is
they
would
have
gone
down
in
history
and
these
blog
entries
would
have
been
preserved
for
future
generations
as
a
monument
to
the
inanity
that
was
the
republican
revolution
of
Newt
Gingrich
and
his
merry
band
of
hanging
judges
In
any
event
I
just
find
Drezner
a
prototypical
example
of
pretty
much
everything
that
is
wrong
with
the
way
things
are
in
this
world
and
that
his
BFF
McMegan
was
dragged
into
it
along
with
him
a
perfectly
fitting
tribute
to
pretty
much
everything
that
has
happened
in
this
shit
storm
of
the
last
8
years
Drezner
is
a
conceited
prick
of
the
highest
order
who
simply
can't
be
bothered
to
even
finish
the
argument
that
he
went
out
and
started
with
Greenwald
I
mean
really
It's
like
he's
a
poseur
bully
who
has
to
run
back
to
his
panel
discussions
on
how
we're
going
to
continue
to
rape
the
working
class
in
ever
more
expansion
of
free
trade
He
doesn't
have
the
time
to
actively
engage
the
ravenous
wolf
that
he's
been
poking
with
a
sharp
stick
because
he
really
has
to
write
about
how
terribly
important
it
is
to
continue
extracting
wealth
from
society
as
a
whole
and
placing
that
wealth
in
the
top
0.001
of
the
world's
populations
bank
account
I
mean
the
man
has
things
to
do
McMegan
Well
she
has
her
nails
to
file
and
writing
the
blog
gets
her
lipstick
money
And
besides
she
has
to
meet
Yglesias
and
Buetler
for
coffee
with
Tyler

For
a
Guy
Who
Didn't
Like
Breasts
He
Was
Alright
One
of
the
things
that
I
will
simply
never
and
I
do
mean
NEVER
forgive
George
W
Bush
for
is
the
fact
that
I
now
think
John
Ashcroft
was
actually
a
decent
human
being
Seriously
This
is
a
guy
who
literally
decided
that
it
was
his
constitutional
duty
to
cover
the
breasts
of
the
statue
of
Justice
that
graces
the
ornate
Great
Hall
of
the
Justice
department
I
mean
it's
hard
for
me
to
even
comprehend
how
a
presumably
heterosexual
man
heck
even
a
man
who
has
zero
interest
in
women
would
think
that
covering
up
one
of
the
more
perfect
forms
that
nature
has
devised
is
actually
something
that
the
entire
department
of
justice
in
the
last
remaining
superpower
on
the
planet
should
be
focussed
on
Mind
boggling
Still
what
I
have
learned
is
that
despite
this
inexplicable
revulsion
of
the
sight
of
a
female
breast
John
Ashcroft
has
repeatedly
shown
that
at
his
base
he
was
truly
an
American
who
understood
what
this
country
was
all
about
when
the
stakes
were
high
According
to
a
top
official
Ashcroft
asked
aloud
after
one
meeting
Why
are
we
talking
about
this
in
the
White
House
History
will
not
judge
this
kindly
I
know
that
we're
all
human
well
most
of
us
anyway
wink
wink
And
believe
me
I
just
cannot
fathom
any
heterosexual
wanting
to
cover
up
the
female
breast
But
here's
a
guy
who
when
the
chips
were
down
when
things
were
at
pretty
much
the
level
where
you'd
think
the
Goat
With
A
Thousand
Young
was
leading
the
meeting
seems
to
be
the
only
one
with
enough
humanity
left
to
raise
the
obvious
point
that
maybe
just
maybe
okaying
torture
for
whatever
fucking
reason
Cheney
came
up
with
wasn't
probably
the
wisest
thing
for
a
presidential
administration
to
be
doing
Add
to
this
the
scene
with
Alberto
Gonzalos
as
Ashcroft
was
essentially
incoherent
in
the
hospital
wrt
warantless
wiretapping
and
I
hate
to
say
it
but
I
am
beginning
to
think
that
I
really
should
just
chill
out
about
the
whole
female
breast
covering
up
obsession
of
his
Almost
I
mean
they
are
breasts
Female
ones
