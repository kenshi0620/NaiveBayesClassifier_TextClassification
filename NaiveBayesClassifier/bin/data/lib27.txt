reports
Sen
John
McCain's
once-comfortable
lead
in
Arizona
has
all

evaporated
according
to
a
new
poll
that
has
the
underdog
Republican
presidential
candidate
struggling
in

With
less
than
a

until
Election
Day
McCain
is
leading
his
Democratic
rival
Illinois
Sen
Barack
Obama
by
2
points
46
to
44
down
from
a
7-point
lead
a
month

and
a
double-digit
lead
this
summer
according

a
poll
from
Arizona
State

Factor
in
the
3-percentage
point
margin
of
