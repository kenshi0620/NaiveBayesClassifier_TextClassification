Another
fake
success
story
debunked
Two
years
ago
President
Bush
hailed
Najim
al
Jabouri
as
a
symbol
of
success
in
the
battle
to
curb
Iraq's
sectarian
violence
Today
Jabouri
is
a
symbol
of
how
uncertain
that
success
is
Last
month
Jabouri
quietly
left
Tal
Afar
an
ancient
city
near
Iraq's
desert
border
with
Syria
where
he
was
the
police
chief
and
the
mayor
collected
his
wife
and
four
children
and
flew
to
safety
in
the
United
States.It
needs
to
be
pointed
out
that
the
surge
has
reduced
violence
in
Iraq
to
the
point
where
if
it
was
happening
in
the
US
we
would
describe
it
as
a
total
unrelenting

Obama
And
Maddow
by
tristero
Rachel
Maddow
Interviews
Barack
Obama
It's
a
fascinating
and
utterly
refreshing
experience
to
listen
to
an
American
politician
answer
direct
questions
in
a
reasonably
direct
way
One
hopes
she
gets
a
chance
to
sit
down
and
talk
to
him
many
many
more
times
These
two
are
meant
for
each
other
The
viewer
interested
in
psychology
may
want
to
focus
on
the
opening
3
minutes
or
so
when
both
participants
are
clearly
nervous
and
marking
their
territory
For
Maddow
it's
because
this
surely
is
a
major
get
in
her
career
As
for
Obama
he
seemed
off
his
game
at
first
perhaps
because
he
was
facing
potentially
awkward
questions
from
the
left
which
he
has
hardly
ever
encountered
and
certainly
not
in
front
of
an
audience
as
large
as
the
one
Maddow
reaches
In
fact
Maddow
is
a
liberal
hardly
a
leftist
at
least
on
tv
But
soon
the
frozen
grins
and
banter
disappear
with
Obama
trotting
through
a
thankfully
abbreviated
version
of
his
bipartisan
talking
point
and
they
settle
down
to
business
UPDATE
I
should
add
that
Obama
very
graciously
provided
Maddow
a
nice
gift
the
incompetent
part
of
the
GOP
quote
Unlike
many
of
her
interviews
I've
seen
this
wasn't
a
discussion
with
Maddow
actively
expressing
opinions
and
disputing
the
guest's
assertions
Instead
Maddow
let
Obama
talk
in
detail
about
issues
like
improving
the
electrical
grid
or
chemical
plant
safety
She
did
offer
Obama
an
opportunity
to
go
political
but
for
the
most
part
Obama
skillfully
sublimated
the
political
to
wonkery
The
message
was
clear
We
know
that
the
lack
of
chemical
plant
safeguards
is
a
classic
case
of
interest
group
influence
and
there's
no
reason
to
dwell
on
that
How
do
we
go
about
fixing
it
Obama's
answers
on
Afghanistan/Pakistan
clearly
concerned
Maddow
and
me
He
dwelled
almost
exclusively
on
the
need
for
more
American
troops
in
Afghanistan
and
failed
to
answer
her
question
about
an
exit
strategy
The
situation
is
fiendishly
complex
the
threat
of
a
nightmarishly
chaotic
Pakistan
with
Pakistan's
nuclear
arsenal
only
one
of
the
alarming
confounding
variables
is
very
very
real
Only
after
a
long
rambling
answer
on
the
need
for
more
troops
the
part
about
rotating
in
new
people
to
prevent
the
use
of
stop-loss
was
persuasive
I
thought
did
Obama
choose
to
mention
diplomacy
Clearly
a
President
Obama
we
should
be
so
lucky
will
have
to
work
long
and
hard
to
avoid
extending
the
quagmire
that
already
is
Afghnaistan
and
make
sure
it
isn't
extended
into
Pakistan
I'm
not
sure
at
present
he
quite
grasps
the
entire
situation
and
how
to
approach
it
I
don't
blame
him
however
The
catastrophe
Bush
created
with
the
help
of
course
of
Karzai
Musharraf
the
Taliban
and
bin
Laden
is
so
out
of
control
there
may
not
be
anything
truly
helpful
to
be
done
there
for
a
very
long
time
Obama
is
an
intelligent
man
to
be
sure
but
of
all
the
difficult
challenges
he
will
face
if
he
becomes
president
this
one
may
be
the
most
intractable
and
dangerous
It
goes
without
saying
that
McCain
has
neither
the
intellectual
capacity
nor
the
temperament
to
do
anything
about
this
disaster
except
make
it
10
times
worse
Palin
Jebus
the
mind
reels
Qua
interview
this
was
very
good
work
on
Maddow's
part
She
managed
both
to
respect
her
subject
clearly
both
a
serious
person
and
an
awesomely
canny
politician
and
also
illuminate
issues
where
Obama's
thinking
is
by
no
means
as
focused
as
it
must
be
Could
she
have
been
more
forceful
and
probing
Of
course
but
let's
not
forget
that
Maddow
has
already
dug
far
deeper
into
Obama's
thoughts
on
Afghanistan/Pakistan
than
came
out
say
in

Horror

Nobel
Prize
Edition
The
long-feared
capitulation
of
American
consumers
has
arrived
According
to
Thursday's
G.D.P
report
real
consumer
spending
fell
at
an
annual
rate
of
3.1
percent
in
the
third
quarter
real
spending
on
durable
goods
stuff
like
cars
and
TVs
fell
at
an
annual
rate
of
14
percent
To
appreciate
the
significance
of
these
numbers
you
need
to
know
that
American
consumers
almost
never
cut
spending
Consumer
demand
kept
rising
right
through
the
2001
recession
the
last
time
it
fell
even
for
a
single
quarter
was
in
1991
and
there
hasn't
been
a
decline
this
steep
since
1980
when
the
economy
was
suffering
from
a
severe
recession
combined
with
double-digit
inflation
Also
these
numbers
are
from
the
third
quarter
the
months
of
July
August
and
September
So
these
data
are
basically
telling
us
what
happened
before
confidence
collapsed
after
the
fall
of
Lehman
Brothers
in
mid-September
not
to
mention
before
the
Dow
plunged
below
10,000
Nor
do
the
data
show
the
full
effects
of
the
sharp
cutback
in
the
availability
of
consumer
credit
which
is
still
under
way
So
this
looks
like
the
beginning
of
a
very
big
change
in
consumer
behavior
And
it
couldn't
have
come
at
a
worse
time
It's
true
that
American
consumers
have
long
been
living
beyond
their
means
In
the
mid-1980s
Americans
saved
about
10
percent
of
their
income
Lately
however
the
savings
rate
has
generally
been
below
2
percent
sometimes
it
has
even
been
negative
and
consumer
debt
has
risen
to
98
percent
of
G.D.P
twice
its
level
a
quarter-century
ago
Some
economists
told
us
not
to
worry
because
Americans
were
offsetting
their
growing
debt
with
the
ever-rising
values
of
their
homes
and
stock
portfolios
Somehow
though
we're
not
hearing
that
argument
much
lately.Gulp

Cutting
Off
Your
Nose
To
Spite
Your
Base
by
digby
As
we
approach
this
historic
election
and
watch
the
Village
start
to
panic
at
the
prospect
of
the
dirty
hippies
coming
to
town
to
trash
the
place
I
think
the
least
we
can
expect
from
this
congress
is
that
Joe
Lieberman
the
man
who
has
applauded
as
John
McCain
called
Barack
Obama
a
socialist
and
Sarah
W
Palin
as
she
said
he
palled
around
with
terrorists
be
expelled
from
the
caucus
Sadly
it
appears
they
want
to
reward
his
traitorous
behavior
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
even
after
that
perfidious
putz
gave
a
major
endorsement
speech
at
the
Republican
convention
From
Bold
Progressives
Today
the
Hill
reports
One
Democratic
source
said
Lieberman
is
not
likely
to
lose
his
position
in
the
Democratic
caucus
even
if
the
party
picks
up
several
seats
in
next
week's
election
There's
no
sense
in
cutting
off
our
nose
to
spite
our
face
one
source
said.When
will
Democratic
leaders
realize
that
every
time
Joe
Lieberman
spouts
right-wing
talking
points
on
TV
as
a
Democrat
or
attends
a
Republican
press
conference
as
a
Democrat
that
spites
their
face
big-time
So
here's
the
plan
Immediately
after
Election
Day
if
Democrats
don't
need
Lieberman
as
their
60th
vote
in
the
Senate
progressive
activists
in
Nevada
will
stand
in
front
of
Harry
Reid's
office
for
hours
and
read
your
letters
to
Harry
Reid
about
Joe
Lieberman
Media
will
be
invited
It
will
be
a
grand
spectacle
and
Harry
Reid
will
get
the
hint
that
in
the
progressive
era
he
needs
to
be
bold
And
the
first
step
is
to
boot
Joe
Lieberman
Write
your
letter
to
Reid
here
It's
unfortunate
that
we
are
going
to
have
to
create
spectacle
to
make
them
do
the
right
thing
but
it
appears
that
they
are
going
to
pretend
that
Joe
Lieberman
is
still
a
member
of
the
democratic
party
after
having
spent
the
last
year
trashing
everything
it
stands
for
They
are
telling
the
Democratic
base
of
this
country
that
they
value
his
sorry
ass
more
than
they
do
ours
It's
unacceptable
There's
no
excuse

Two
pieces
of
very
good
news
for
No
on
Prop
8
First
the
latest
Field
Poll
shows
the
initiative
failing
Prop
8
is
down
by
5
points
44
Yes
49
No
While
one
would
like
to
see
these
two
numbers
further
apart
these
are
pretty
good
numbers
And
as
the
campaign
points
out
Field
is
just
about
the
only
pollster
that
has
a
good
track
record
on
propositions
at
about
94
All
that
being
said
this
is
still
going
to
be
a
tight
race
One
worrisome
indicator
is
that
for
those
who
voted
already
Yes
is
leading
So
please
please
do
not
let
up
The
progressive
position
tends
to
fare
better
on
election
day
but
that
requires
we
do
all
the
hard
GOTV
work
Do
not
quit
at
6PM
when
some
LGBT
organizations
in
LA
have
ridiculously
chosen
to
start
their
party
Do
not
quit
until
that
last
poll
closes
Absolutely
correct
I
don't
think
this
proposition
will
work
like
traditional
ones
where
all
the
undecideds
break
toward
No
It's
going
to
come
down
to
turnout
If
you're
in
the
state
you
can
help
with
GOTV
The
other
good
news
is
this
excellent
ad
their
best
of
the
year
describing
the
history
of
discrimination
in
California
for
people
of
all
stripes
and
imploring
viewers
not
to
add
to
that
sad
legacy
And
yes
that's
Samuel
L
Jackson
If
you
want
to
shame
the
Mormons
and
the
Knights
of
Columbus
who
would
rather
write
their
intolerance
into
state
Constitutions
across
the
country
remember
this
ad
And
help
defeat
this
proposition

No
One
Could
Have
Anticipated
by
dday
That
actions
have
consequences
The
Syrian
government
has
broken
relations
with
Baghdad
It
has
completely
opened
its
border
This
article
in
Al-Arabiya
Al-Arabiya
is
generally
fairly
reliable
says
that
the
Syrians
have
reduced
their
forces
on
the
border
That's
NOT
what
I'm
hearing
from
BOTH
sides
of
the
border
What
I'm
hearing
from
very
trustworthy
sources
whom
I've
known
for
years
is
that
the
Syrians
have
completely
withdrawn
their
forces
from
the
border
No
troops
No
border
guards
No
police
While
the
total
number
of
foreign
fighters
in
Iraq
was
never
that
large
they
have
often
been
deadly
particularly
for
US
troops
And
Syria
was
actually
doing
a
fair
job
of
tightening
the
border
But
no
more
Funny
how
air-dropping
commando
units
into
a
sovereign
nation
can
clarify
the
mind
a
bit
So
our
reward
for
getting
rid
of
maybe
one
tiny
group
of
foreign
agitators
is
a
target
on
the
backs
of
140,000
US
troops
as
well
as
untold
numbers
of
Iraqis
That's
why
they
call
it
blowback

The

by

catches
TNR
patting
the
press
corps
on
its
collective
heads
because
it's
so
darned
tuckered
from
the
long
campaign
it
can't
even
think
of
anything
to
write
about
anymore
And
he
reminds
us
that
he
warned
this
would
happen
a
long
time
ago
The
arrival
of
my
year-end
issue
of
Newsweek
in
December
was
accompanied
by
a
palpable
sense
of
dread
Featuring
Sens
Barack
Obama
D-IL
and
Hillary
Rodham
Clinton
D-NY
on
the
cover
with
the
headline
The
Race
is
On
the
issue
landed
with
a
thud
like
an
unwanted
fruitcake
amidst
the
holiday
season
How
else
to
respond
to
a
2008
campaign
preview
package
published
98
weeks
before
Election
Day
and
nearly
400
days
before
a
single
registered
Democrat
would
vote
in
a
primary
That
plus
the
fact
the
2008
drumbeat
was
sounding
just
six
weeks
after
the
all-consuming
midterm
elections
had
been
completed
Am
I
the
only
one
who
thinks
it's
madness
to
turn
White
House
campaigns
into
22-month
press
events
Or
is
it
sacrosanct
along
the
New
York-Washington
D.C
media
corridor
where
pontificating
about
politics
can
pay
very
well
to
suggest
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
too
much
mainstream
media
election
coverage
The
press
truly
has
embraced
the
notion
of
the
nonstop
campaign
and
I
think
has
done
so
for
increasingly
selfish
reasons
For
political
scribes
presidential
campaigns
used
to
be
the
sports
car
their
parents
let
them
take
out
for
a
spin
once
every
four
years
to
show
off
Now
it's
become
a
case
of
incessant
cruising
with
endless
preening
and
posing
Specifically
White
House
campaigns
can
be
career-making
seasons
when
high-profile
promotions
book
deals
TV
punditry
contracts
and
teaching
positions
can
be
pocketed
For
news
media
companies
presidential
campaigns
meanbig
business
relatively
inexpensive
content
that
can
be
endlessly
rehashed
In
other
words
they're
good
for
the
bottom
line
The
never-ending
analysis
for
2008
though
has
already
morphed
into
a
deafening
background
noise
And
the
press
often
shallow
performance
last
week
does
not
bode
well
for
the
long
term
No
kidding
They
turned
this
thing
into
a
marathon
spectacle
that
now
seems
longer
than
world
war
II
And
I'm
quite
sure
that
people
are
excited
and
engaged
in
spite
of
the
coverage
rather
than
because
of
it
which
is
a
testament
to
Obama's
great
appeal
and
the
hideous
reality
of
what
the
conservatives
have
wrought
The
TNR
article
congratulates
the
press
for
behaving
like
adults
and
not
hating
either
of
the
candidates
which
is

ever

you

Story
by

Just
so
you
know
RUSH
We
either
are
what
we
are
or
not
The
dirty
little
secret
is
the
vast
majority
of
the
people
in
this
country
live
their
lives
as
conservatives
and
given
conservative
leadership
they
respond
to
it
in
droves
Landslide
droves
CALLER
One
reason
that
that
difference
is
there
is
because
Democrats
and
liberals
specifically
have
a
lot
easier
time
in
public
of
espousing
their
views
regardless
of
what
other
people
think
RUSH
Right
because
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
dignity...They
don't
have
to
worry
about
it
That's
what
J.R
Ewing
said
Once
you
get
rid
of
the
ethics
and
dignity
the
rest
is
easy...You
know
they've
gotten
away
so
long
as
being
the
caring
party
they're
the
party
that
cares
about
the
downtrodden
They
have
destroyed
They
have
created
the
downtrodden
Liberalism
has
created
the
downtrodden
and
the
unhappy
and
the
miserable
and
then
the
liberals
set
themselves
up
as
their
champions
say
Only
we
can
fix
them
because
only
we
care
They
don't
care
They
loathe
them
There
is
contempt
by
the
way
for
these
little
people
Real
compassion
By
the
way
we
have
to
do
a
far
better
job
of
PR
I'm
not
denying
this
Real
compassion
is
conservatism
Real
compassion
cares
for
the
individual
Real
conservatism
wants
every
individual
to
be
the
best
he
or
she
can
be
with
nobody
standing
in
the
way
Let
a
person
use
what
their
God-given
talents
are
combined
with
their
ambition
and
their
energy
and
their
desire
and
their
dreams
and
get
out
of
their
way
We
want
people
to
amount
to
the
most
they
want
to
be
and
can
be
But
for
those
who
have
a
legitimate
problem
they
have
some
sort
of
problem
that
prevents
them
from
succeeding
we
are
all
for
taking
care
of
those
people
But
we
do
not
want
to
take
normal
healthy
Americans
and
turn
them
into
wards
of
the
state
turn
them
into
dependents
We
do
not
want
to
look
at
them
with
arrogant
condescension
We
don't
look
at
them
and
say
You're
worthless
You're
stupid
You're
not
part
of
the
smart
group
You
can't
get
anywhere
without
us
We
don't
look
at
people
that
way
We
look
at
people
with
respect
hope
You
talk
about
hope
We
hope
for
this
country
to
be
the
best
damn
country
it
can
be
and
you
need
the
best
damn
individuals
for
that
to
happen
Conservatism
is
about
the
individual
Liberalism
doesn't
care
about
the
individual
This
is
simple
We
just
have
to
tell
the
story
about
it
Rush
is
the
epitome
of
a
conservative
sweetheart
hopeful
dignified
and
ethical
The
problem
is
just
that
conservatives
haven't
been
allowed
to
tell
their
story
they
have
bad
PR
Maybe
someday
one
of
them
will
have
a
radio
show
with
over
20
million
listeners
for
over
two
decades
to
tell
it
Until
that
day
we
can
only
dream
of
a
time
in
the
future
when
conservatism
will
have
its
day
in
the
sun
Meanwhile
be
sure
to
take
the
compassionate
ethical
dignified
Rush's
advice
or
you
could
be
brainwashed
I
do
remember
reading
that
the
highly
educated
are
the
most
susceptible
to
being
hypnotized
so
that
would
put
me
in
the
risk
group
ladies
and
gentlemen
And
yet
I'm
going
to
watch
Obama
tonight
If
you
do
watch
Obama
tonight
here's
the
sign
that
I
want
you
to
make
for
your
TV
Do
not
be
hypnotized
You
are
listening
to
a
socialist
In
case
you're
wondering
the
highly
educated
Rush
isn't
using
hypnotized
as
a
metaphor
He
means
it
literally
Update
Here's
some
more
of

compassionate
conservatism

another

I'll

this

exactly
what
I
expected

happen
upon

But
the

Retreating

Ari

written
an
interesting
article
about
how
the
web
has
impacted
the
use

deconstructing

exposing
them
That
tracks
with
Drew

that
the
the
key
to
dealing
with
these
lizard
brain
tactics
is
to
lay
them
out
so
people
can
see
exactly
what
they
mean
and
then
reject
them
I
think
there
is
truth
in
this
but
it's
also
true
that
as
much
as
the
internet
has
made
it
easier
to
do
expose
political
tactics
it
has
also
created
a
monster
with
these
email
whisper
campaigns
that
people
believe
because
they
tend
to
come
from
someone
they
know
and
are
ubiquitous
and
untraceable
This
for

is

amazing

of

This
good
for
the
country
and
good

Once

the
heady
feeling

making
a

they'll
know
what
it
is
to
be

the
klaxon
that

gonna
have
the
Justice
Department
intervene
in
an
Ohio
voting
rights
case
As
dday
wrote,"This
is
attempted
voter
suppression
at
the
highest
levels
Looks
like
good
news
The
Department
of
Justice
will
not
require
Ohio
to
disclose
the
names
of
voters
whose
registration
applications
did
not
match
other
government
databases
according
to
two
people
familiar
with
discussions
between
state
and
federal
lawyers
The
decision
comes
about
a
week
after
an
unusual
request
from
President
Bush
asking
the
department
to
investigate
the
matter
and
roughly
two
weeks
after
the
Supreme
Court
dismissed
a
case
involving
the
flagged
registration
applications
Federal
law
requires
states
to
verify
voter
registration
applications
with
a
government
database
like
those
used
for
driver's
licenses
or
Social
Security
cards
Names
that
do
not
match
are
flagged
for
further
verification
But
the
law
provides
little
guidance
on
how
these
flagged
registrations
should
be
handled
and
discrepancies
corrected
Ohio
Republicans
had
sought
the
lists
to
challenge
voters
but
the
Ohio
Secretary
of
State
Jennifer
Brunner
a
Democrat
refused
the
request
saying
that
numerical
errors
or
misspellings
are
the
probable
reason
for
most
of
the
discrepancies
Forcing
these
voters
to
cast
provisional
ballots
would
possibly
disenfranchise
thousands
of
eligible
voters
she
said
since
these
ballots
are
easier
to
disqualify
Republicans
then
took
their
request
to
court
but
were
unsuccessful
The
Justice
Department
has
been
in
contact
with
Ohio
election
officials
since
early
October
and
this
week
its
lawyers
determined
they
would
not
pursue
litigation
before
the
election
according
to
the
sources
familiar

the
discussions
Most
studies
by
non-partisan

have
found
little
evidence
that
voter

is
a

Being

computers
I
often
find
the
world
of
Big
Money
a
deeply
strange
place
A.I.G
for
example
The
American
International
Group
is
rapidly
running
through
123
billion
in
emergency
lending
provided
by
the
Federal
Reserve
raising
questions
about
how
a
company
claiming
to
be
solvent
in
September
could
have
developed
such
a
big
hole
by
October
Some
analysts
say
at
least
part
of
the
shortfall
must
have
been
there
all
along
hidden
by
irregular
accounting
You
don't
just
suddenly
lose
120
billion
overnight
said
Donn
Vickrey
of
Gradient
Analytics
an
independent
securities
research
firm
in
Scottsdale
Ariz.Well
yes
that's
what
I
would
have
thought
But
here's
the
thing
Why
is
this
being
brought
up
now
Isn't
Where
the
hell
did
that
120,000,000,000
go
like
you
know
a
question
you
ask
before
you
agree
to
a
loan
and
write
em
a
check
Then
there's
this
Mr
Vickery
and
other
analysts
are
examining
the
company's
disclosures
for
clues
that
the
cushion
was
threadbare
and
that
company
officials
knew
they
had
major
losses
months
before
the
bailout
Tantalizing
support
for
this
argument
comes
from
what
appears
to
have
been
a
behind-the-scenes
clash
at
the
company
over
how
to
value
some
of
its
derivatives
contracts
An
accountant
brought
in
by
the
company
because
of
an
earlier
scandal
was
pushed
to
the
sidelines
on
this
issue
and
the
company's
outside
auditor
PricewaterhouseCoopers
warned
of
a
material
weakness
months
before
the
government
bailout
The
internal
auditor
resigned
and
is
now
in
seclusion

to
a
former

WTF

Since

do
auditors
go
into

I
thought
only

authors
did
that
Has

Seems
to
me
that

buy
a

one
heckuva

we

A.I.G
has
declined
to

account

Oh

internal
auditor
who
resigns
goes
into
seclusion
and
a
replacement
who
won't
provide
details
when
asked
on
how
the
new

are
being
used
Something
smell
a
little
strange
here
Y'think
Now
to
be
fair

company
said
it
could
not
provide
more
information
ahead
of
its

report
expected
next
week
the
first

Even
so
one
would
think
they
would
have
these
figures
available
on
demand
for
those
of
us
American
taxpayers
who
are
fronting
them
the
cash
But
let's
press
on
The
Fed
releases
a
weekly
figure
most
recently
showing
that
90
billion
of
the
123
billion
available
has
been
drawn
down
A.I.G
has
outlined
only
broad
categories
some
is
being
used
to
shore
up
its
securities-lending
program
some
to
make
good
on
its
guaranteed
investment
contracts
some
to
pay
for
day-to-day
operations
and
of
perhaps
greatest
interest
to
watchdogs
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
to
post
collateral
with
other
financial
institutions
as
required
by
A.I.G.'s
many
derivatives
contracts
No
information
has
been
supplied
yet
about
who
these
counterparties
are
how
much
collateral
they
have
received
or
what
additional
tripwires
may
require
even
more
collateral
if
the
housing
market
continues
to

to

like

the

If

had
a
chance
to
see
the

and
then
the
Midnight
Rally
with
Obama
and
Bill
Clinton
then
you
saw
what
Democrats
look
like
when
they're
winning
It's
been
a

since
anyone
but
conservatives
have
been
in
this
position
and
it's
nice
to
see
They
are
firing
on
all
cylinders
right
now
making
the
case
with
style
looking
very
confident
I'm
always
hesitant
to
allow
myself
to
get

tonight
I

might

might

Tina
Brown's
new
site
seems
to
be
featuring
a
lot
of
disaffected
feminists
who
are
leaving
the
Democratic
party
Yesterday
we
had
this
former
editor
of
Ms
magazine
extolling
the
virtues
of
Sara
W
Palin.Today's
goodbye
to
all
that
essay
is
from
someone
named
Wendy
Button
who
was
a
speechwriter
for
John
Edwards
and
as
recently
as
a
few
months
ago
was
writing
speeches
for
Michelle
Obama
Apparently
everything
changed
for
her
in
August
It
got
stronger
during
the
Democratic
National
Convention
when
I
counted
the
substantive
mentions
of
poverty
on
one
hand
and
a
whole
bunch
of
bad
canned
partisan
lines
against
Senator
John
McCain
Some
faith
was
lifted
after
Senator
Hillary
Clinton's
grace
during
a
difficult
hour
But
that
faith
was
dashed
when
I
saw
that
someone
had
raided
the
Caligula
set
and
planted
the
old
columns
at
Invesco
Field
The
final
straw
came
the
other
week
when
Samuel
Joseph
Wurzelbacher
a.k.a
Joe
the
Plumber
asked
a
question
about
higher
taxes
for
small
businesses
Instead
of
celebrating
his
aspirations
they
were
mocked
He
wasn't
a
real
plumber
and
They're
fighting
for
Joe
the
Hedge-Fund
manager
and
the
patronizing
I've
got
nothing
but
love
for
Joe
the
Plumber
Having
worked
in
politics
I
know
that
absolutely
none
of
this
is
on
the
level
This
back
and
forth
is
posturing
a
charade
and
a
political
game
These
lines
are
what
I
refer
to
as
hooker
lines
a
sure
thing
to
get
applause
and
the
press
to
scribble
as
if
they're
reporting
meaningful
news
I'm
sorry
but
none
of
this
scans
as
truth
to
me
She
was
an
Edwards
staffer
who
then
worked
for
Michelle
was
briefly
inspired
by
Clinton
at
the
convention
but
was
turned
off
by
the
anti-McCain
rhetoric
at
the
convention
And
then
after
watching
Joe
the
Plumber
call
Obama
a
terrorist
and
a
socialist
what
really
bothers
her
is
that
somebody
then
mocked
him
in
return
C'mon
She
isn't
a
PUMA
She
comes
from
the
Edwards
camp
She's
mad
because
the
Democrats
aren't
talking
about
poverty
So
she's
going
to
vote
for
the
Republicans
because
she
agrees
with
them
on
economics
Joe
the
Plumber
is
right
This
is
the
absolutely
worst
time
to
raise
taxes
on
anyone
the
rich
the
middle
class
the
poor
small
businesses
and
corporations
Our
economy
is
in
the
tank
for
many
complicated
reasons
especially
because
people
don't
have
enough
money
So
let
them
keep
it
Let
businesses
keep
it
so
they
can
create
jobs
and
stay
here
and
weather
this
storm
And
yet
the
Democratic
ideology
remains
the
same
Our
approach
to
problems
big
government
solutions
paid
for
by
taxing
the
rich
and
big
and
smaller
companies
is
just
as
tired
and
out
of
date
as
trickle
down
economics
How
about
a
novel
approach
that
simply
finds
a
sane
way
to
stop
the
bleeding
How
about
magic
Then
we
hear
a
fairly
standard
rant
about
how
Democrats
and
the
press
treated
Clinton
badly
and
are
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
to
Sarah
W
Palin
Governor
Palin
and
I
don't
agree
on
a
lot
of
things
mostly
social
issues
But
I
have
grown
to
appreciate
the
Governor
I
was
one
of
those
initial
skeptics
and
would
laugh
at
the
pictures
Not
anymore
When
someone
takes
on
a
corrupt
political
machine
and
a
sitting
governor
that
is
not
done
by
someone
with
a
low
I.Q
or
a
moral
core
made
of
tissue
paper
When
someone
fights
her
way
to
get
scholarships
and
work
her
way
through
college
even
in
a
jagged
line
that
shows
determination
and
humility
you
can't
learn
from
reading
Reinhold
Niebuhr
When
a
mother
brings
her
son
with
special
needs
onto
the
national
stage
with
love
honesty
and
pride
that
gives
hope
to
families
like
mine
as
my
older
brother
lives
with
a
mental
disability
Ok
She's
come
to
like
Palin
Whatever
But
what
can
we
conclude
about
this
bit
of
incoherence
But
thank
God
for
election
2008
We
can
talk
about
the
wardrobe
and
make-up
even
though
most
people
don't
understand
the
details
about
Senator
Obama's
plan
with
Iraq
When
he
says
all
combat
troops
he's
not
talking
about
all
troops
it
leaves
a
residual
force
of
as
large
as
55,000
indefinitely
That's
not
ending
the
war
that's
half
a
war
I
was
dead
wrong
about
the
surge
and
thought
it
would
be
a
disaster
Senator
John
McCain
led
when
many
of
us
were
ready
to
quit
Yet
we
march
on
as
if
nothing
has
changed
wedded
to
an
old
plan
and
that
too
is
a
long
way
from
the
Democratic
Party
Is
she
for
the
war
or
against
it
I
honestly
can't
tell
It's
not
that
I
don't
get
that
a
lot
of
people
are
still
torqued
about
the
primary
and
have
a
lot
of
bad
feelings
on
the
feminist
working
class
front
These
are
not
illegitimate
gripes
even
if
I
don't
share
them
But
it's
very
weird
for
a
liberal
of
any
stripe
much
less
a
political
professional
to
make
this
case
on
the
basis
of
taxes
and
the
Iraq
war
no
matter
how
disgruntled
they
might
be
with
the
Obama
campaign
And
all
this
seems
to
have
come
to
her
rather
recently
for
reasons
that
aren't
clear
It's
nearly
impossible
for
me
to
see
what
road
takes
you
from
being
a
John
Edwards
speechwriter
talking
about
the
plight
of
the
poor
and
ending
the
war
to
supporting
McCain
and
Palin
who
are
running
around
calling
Democrats
Marxists
and
talking
about
victory
in
Iraq
And
there
is
nothing
in
this
somewhat
incoherent
essay
that
explains
it
Well
except
maybe
this
Before
I
cast
my
vote
I
will
correct
my
party
affiliation
and
change
it
to
No
Party
or
Independent
Then
in
the
spirit
of
election
2008
I'll
get
a
manicure
pedicure
and
my
hair
done
Might
as
well
look
pretty
when
I
am
unemployed
in
a
city
swimming
with
D's
Whatever
inspiration
I
had
in
Chapel
Hill
two
years
ago
is
gone
When
people
say
how
excited
they
are
about
this
election
I
can
now
say
Maybe
for
you
But
I
lost
my
home
I
suspect
there's
going
to
be
a
very
lucrative
niche
opening
up
for
these
Palin
Democrats
with
lots
of
wingnut
welfare
to
go
around
It's

I
haven't
done
too
much
writing
about
Prop
8
here
though
I
have
at
my
other
haunts
Over
at
Calitics
we've
devoted
a
substantial
amount
of
time
and
resources
to
it
and
we've
raised
over
50,000
at
the
Calitics
ActBlue
Page
for
Equality
for
All
I've
been
praiseworthy
of
the
campaign
at
times
critical
at
others
I
think
their
ads
fail
to
put
a
face
on
who
the
discrimination
would
actually
harm
and
as
such
come
off
as
vague
and
allow
the
theocons
to
distract
and
distort
the
issue
they'll
teach
your
kids
how
to
be
gay
and
drive
the
narrative
I've
been
happy
that
much
of
the
progressive
movement
has
come
together
to
defend
this
attack
on
civil
rights
and
that
even
establishment
figures
like
Maria
Shriver
and
Dianne
Feinstein
have
gone
public
for
the
cause
Barack
Obama
has
allowed
the
campaign
to
use
him
in
Web
advertising
but
there's
an
argument
to
be
made
that
he
could
do
more
But
instead
of
an
analytical
post
the
short
answer
is
that
every
single
volunteer
is
vital
because
this
will
be
an
extremely
close
vote
I'd
like
to
get
a
little
personal
Today
is
Write
To
Marry
Day
where
hundreds
of
bloggers
are
posting
about
Prop
8
and
their
thoughts
about
gay
marriage
and
civil
rights
I'd
like
to
add
my
own
by
talking
about
the
wedding
I
attended
a
few
months
ago
It
was
unusual
only
for
the
fact
that
it
was
extremely
casual
There
was
morning
coffee
and
some
pastries
and
other
food
and
drinks
set
up
on
picnic
benches
at
a
park
in
the
hills
behind
Berkeley
and
a
large
field
where
the
wedding
was
held
When
the
announcement
was
given
for
the
ceremony
to
begin
everybody
kind
of
meandered
over
to
the
field
and
stood
around
in
a
circle
The
aisle
for
the
couple
to
walk
down
had
to
be
created
impromptu
Eventually
that
got
sorted
out
Other
than
that
the
event
had
what
you
might
expect
two
people
who
loved
one
another
making
a
commitment
to
spend
their
lives
together
It
was
entirely
unremarkable
and
indistinguishable
from
any
other
wedding
where
I've
been
invited
Except
for
one
thing
The
ceremony
was
conducted
by
Assemblymember
soon
to
be
State
Senator
Mark
Leno
He
is
notable
for
having
authored
the
marriage
equality
law
that
passed
through
the
California
legislature
twice
only
to
be
vetoed
by
Governor
Schwarzenegger
Just
remember
that
the
next
time
someone
tells
you
he's
practically
a
liberal
He's
opposing
Prop
8
supposedly
but
has
gone
completely
silent
on
the
issue
In
brief
remarks
Leno
talked
about
how
the
issue
was
not
made
clear
to
him
until
the
Massachusetts
Supreme
Court
rendered
their
decision
on
the
law
He
quoted
the
text
of
the
decision
at
length
particularly
this
portion
The
SJC
ruling
held
that
the
Massachusetts
constitution
forbids
the
creation
of
second-class
citizens
The
state
Attorney
General's
office
which
argued
to
the
court
that
state
law
doesn't
allow
gay
couples
to
marry
has
failed
to
identify
any
constitutionally
adequate
reason
for
denying
civil
marraige
to
same-sex
couples
Marshall
wrote
The
creation
of
second-class
citizens
is
really
the
nub
of
this
said
Leno
By
defining
marriage
in
such
a
way
those
who
would
seek
to
ban
gay
marriage
tell
those
who
wish
to
love
one
another
how
they
can
do
it
But
this
is
part
of
the
common
experience
of
the
human
condition
the
desire
to
love
another
man
or
woman
and
profess
a
commitment
to
them
What
is
perverse
indeed
irrational
and
against
human
nature
is
to
defy
that
love
and
that
commitment
The
right
to
marry
is
a
right
to
share
in
the
common
experience
of
man
It
has
served
the
nation
and
the
world
with
tangible
societal
benefits
and
promotion
of
the
family
It
is
a
profoundly
conservative
virtue
And
this
was
a
very
small-c
conservative
simple
wedding
just
two
people
two
men
and
their
friends
and
family
coming
together
to
express
their
love
and
joy
This
is
what
those
who
would
pass
Prop
8
would
snuff
out
Indeed
they
are
the
radicals
the
kind
of
people
who
would
express
that
equality
is
not
an
American
value
They
have
to
rewrite
the
Declaration
of
Independence
to
fit
their
worldview
We
hold
these
truths
to
be
self-evident
that
all
men
are
created
equal
It's
really
as
simple
as
that
I
was
thinking
while
attending
this
wedding
that
I
would
maybe
write
something
about
the
feelings
it
engendered
the
wonderful
picture
of
basic
civil
rights
being
expressed
But
it
was
totally
unremarkable
which
is
why
I
waited
so
long
It
was
banal
even
It
was
just
two
people
that
love
one
another
among
the
hundreds
of
millions
and
even
billions
on
this
planet
There
was
nothing
that
special
about
it
Which
is
why
it
should
not
be
singled
out
and
rejected
If
you
can
volunteer
for
No
on
8
or
donate
to
their
cause
It's
the
best
investment
in
normalcy
that
you'll

Chris
Matthews
just
allowed
Tom
Delay
to
call
Barack
Obama
a
radical
militant
Marxist
who
wants
to
pack
the
Supreme
Court
with
communists
and
is
far
to
the
left
of
Barney
Frank
and
then
chided
Debbie
Wasserman
Schultz
when
she
said
that
one
should
consider
the
source
when
it's
someone
who
was
forced
to
leave
Washington
in
disgrace
after
presiding
over
the
most
corrupt
congress
in
history
Apparently
what
she
said
was
disrespectful
The
right
wing
is
working
itself
up
into
an
epic
frenzy
of
hate
about
Obama
And
guys
like
Matthews
aren't
exactly
drawing
any
lines
by
allowing
these
guys
to
spew
this
disgusting
swill
on
national
TV
which
doesn't
bode
well
for
the
future
Cable
news
and
talk
radio
are
easily
turned
into
cauldrons
of
hate
for
high
ratings
and
big
advertising
dollars
The
right
wing
noise
machine
is
already
working
them
And
by
the
way
if
there
has
ever
been
a
more
transparent
effort
to
bully
a
new
president
into
doing
your
bidding
than
declaring
that
he
will
never
cut
taxes
on
anyone
and
instead
wants
to
raise
them
to
90
I
can't
think
of
one
Luckily
Obama
doesn't
appear
to
be
subject
to
schoolyard
dares
but
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
conservatives
are
staking
out
ground
way
way
over
to
the
far
right
so
they
can
keep
the
goal
posts
firmly
right
of
center
And
knowing
the
way
the
village
operates
I
expect
they
will
have
some
success
See
there's
Colin
Powell
on
the
left
and
Tom
Delay
on
the
right
If
Obama
stays
somewhere
in
between
he'll
be
a
great
bipartisan
president
who
gets
things
done

Socialist
Republicans
by
digby
Hendrick
Herzberg's
column
in
the
New
Yorker
is
all
about
this
socialism
nonsense
and
he
does
a
particularly
good
job
of
explaining
Alaska's
special
brand
of
it
Sarah
Palin
who
has
lately
taken
to
calling
Obama
Barack
the
Wealth
Spreader
seems
to
be
something
of
a
suspect
character
herself
She
is
at
the
very
least
a
fellow-traveller
of
what
might
be
called
socialism
with
an
Alaskan
face
The
state
that
she
governs
has
no
income
or
sales
tax
Instead
it
imposes
huge
levies
on
the
oil
companies
that
lease
its
oil
fields
The
proceeds
finance
the
government's
activities
and
enable
it
to
issue
a
four-figure
annual
check
to
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
state
One
of
the
reasons
Palin
has
been
a
popular
governor
is
that
she
added
an
extra
twelve
hundred
dollars
to
this
year's
check
bringing
the
per-person
total
to
3,269
But
lord
how
they
hate
the
government
Alaskan
Republicans
will
be
the
first
in
line
to
cash
the
check
while
telling
each
other
how
much
they
resent
paying
taxes
and
want
the
government
out
of
their
lives
Last
night
slimy
Ari
Fleischer
was
on
Larry
King
lying
as
easily
as
he
breathes
claiming
among
other
things
that
Obama
hates
Israel
And
here's
what
he
had
to
say
about
this
L
KING
We
have
a
blog
question
for
Ari
Fleischer
It's
from
Dawn
How
does
Sarah
Palin's
policy
in
Alaska
of
taxing
the
oil
companies
and
distributing
3,269
to
each
citizen
differ
from
distributing
the
wealth
FLEISCHER
Well
that's
because
there
is
no
state
income
tax
in
Alaska
Nobody
has
to
pay
because
Alaska
has
such
an
abundance
of
natural
resources
The
state
actually
gets
the
royalties
and
passes
it
back
to
its
citizens
I
wish
that
was
the
case
for
everybody
in
every
state
That
would
be
a
real
big
growing
private
enterprise
I'd
have
no
problem
with
that
Golly
that
sure
sound
like
some
sort
of
redistributional
scheme
to
me
but
what
do
I
know
And
here
I
thought
I
heard
McCain
and
Palin
railing
against
corporate
taxes
So
how
does
Palin
explain
it
Here's
Hertzberg
again
A
few
weeks
before
she
was
nominated
for
Vice-President
she
told
a
visiting
journalist
Philip
Gourevitch
of
this
magazine
that
we're
set
up
unlike
other
states
in
the
union
where
it's
collectively
Alaskans
own
the
resources
So
we
share
in
the
wealth
when
the
development
of
these
resources
occurs

Voter
Suppression
Watch
by
dday
I'm
still
a
little
stunned
that
it
isn't
a
bigger
story
that
a
sitting
US
President
is
ordering
his
Attorney
General
to
intervene
in
a
voting-rights
case
in
Ohio
a
case
already
decided
by
the
US
Supreme
Court
just
a
week
away
from
the
election
to
pick
his
successor
This
is
attempted
voter
suppression
at
the
highest
levels
with
the
President
essentially
aiding
an
abetting
the
nominee
from
his
own
party
And
if
it's
so
much
as
hit
page
D-38
I'd
be
surprised
Only
the
ACLU
appears
the
least
bit
worked
up
about
this
With
the
election
one
week
away
this
kind
of
intrusion
represents
partisan
politics
at
its
worst
In
addition
challenging
or
purging
lawfully
registered
voters
in
the
days
before
the
election
invites
chaos
and
undermines
the
integrity
of
the
democratic
process
The
whole
letter
is
here
Why
is
this
not
the
talk
of
Democratic
circles
Ohio
may
not
hold
the
key
to
the
election
the
way
it
has
in
years
past
but
injustice
anywhere
is
a
threat
to
justice
everywhere
as
the
saying
goes
My
biggest
fear
is
that
after
the
election
if
Democrats
win
there
will
be
a
strong
pull
to
say
Oh
well
the
system
worked
and
not
to
enact
the
structural
reforms
that
are
needed
at
so
many
levels
whether
that
means
instituting
the
National
Popular
Vote
or
same-day
registration
or
automatic
registration
through
Social
Security
numbers
or
a
ban
on
e-voting
machines
and
a
paper
ballot
requirement
or
instant
runoff
voting
or
a
federal
voting
standard
or
making
Election
Day
a
holiday
The
catch-22
is
that
a
win
breeds
inertia
and
a
loss
means
the
loser
has
no
access
to
the
levers
of
power
But
when
people
like
this
have
a
large
bearing
on
how
elections
are
run
there
is
a
serious
problem
afoot
and
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
eventual
conclusion
seems
correct
Yesterday
we
told
you
about
an
effort
by
Indiana's
Republican
secretary
of
state
Todd
Rokita
to
press
federal
and
state
authorities
to
prosecute
ACORN
for
voter
fraud
Rokita
had
said
a
review
by
his
office
of
forms
submitted
by
ACORN
found
multiple
criminal
violations
But
it
turns
out
that
Rokita
hardly
has
a
reputation
as
a
non-partisan
public
official
In
October
2002
the
South
Bend
Tribune
reported
via
nexis
Working
on
his
own
time
Rokita
also
assisted
George
W
Bush's
campaign
during
the
infamous
Florida
election
recount
in
2000
Rokita
is
proud
of
that
especially
because
the
U.S
Supreme
Court
cited
Indiana
election
law
when
it
decided
the
election
in
Bush's
favor
In
other
words
Rokita
was
part
of
the
team
of
ambitious
young
Republican
operatives
who
flew
down
to
Florida
to
help
out
on
a
bid
to
stymie
the
recount
effort
remember
the
Brooks
Brothers
riot
and
ultimately
put
George
Bush
in
the
White
House
This
is
a
partisan
operative
one
of
Roger
Stone's
freshly
scrubbed
protgs
and
a
McCain
campaign
co-chair
using
his
office
to
attempt
to
pervert
the
election
process
At
some
point
this
must
be
fought
regardless
of
who
wins
and
who
loses

Impolite
Servants
by
digby
So
everybody
in
Hollywood
hates
MSNBC
Michael
Reagan
gets
death
threats
from
sissy
liberals
every
time
he
appears
Whatever
But
this
common
piece
of
right
wing
victimology
is
worth
examining
Actress
Patricia
Heaton
noted
that
Hollywood
workers
too
often
just
assume
everyone
they
work
with
is
a
like-minded
liberal
When
those
around
her
belittle
John
McCain
or
Palin
she
politely
reminds
them
that
she's
a
Republican
That's
what
you
have
to
do
in
our
town
she
said
The
humanity
How
can
she
bear
up
under
it
all
She
says
Hollywood
workers
which
would
indicate
to
me
that
she's
talking
about
crew
as
well
as
fellow
actors
And
it's
true
that
there
are
more
liberal
workers
in
Hollywood
a
lot
of
them
are
union
after
all
I
can
easily
see
Patricia
Heaton
telling
them
to
stop
expressing
their
opinions
around
her
and
them
having
to
do
so
since
she's
a
washed
up
TV
star
I've
had
many
a
boss
do
the
same
thing
Everybody
knows
the
score
But
poor
Heaton
still
feels
put
upon
because
in
her
mind
her
beautiful
ears
should
never
have
to
hear
liberals
being
mean
to
Republicans
It's
impolite
Meanwhile
liberals
in
this
country
have
been
subjected
to
conservatives
slinging
crap
like
this
for
years
every
time
we
turn
on
the
radio
LIMBAUGH
I
mean
if
there
is
a
party
that's
soulless
it's
the
Democratic
Party
If
there
are
people
by
definition
who
are
soulless
it
is
liberals
by
definition
You
know
souls
come
from
God
You
know
No
No
You
can't
go
there
That
guy
is
given
awards
and
treated
like
a
king
among
the
conservative
set
which
includes
the
entire
Republican
establishment
Just
a
couple
of
months
ago
both
Bush
presidents
called
the
show
to
shoot
the
breeze
with
its
polite
host
For
the
last
thirty
years
I
have
been
listening
to
politicians
run
as
proud
conservatives
without
even
the
slightest
acknowledgment
that
more
than
half
the
country
identifies
themselves
differently
Even
the
Democrats
go
to
great
lengths
to
assure
the
country
they
aren't
latte
sipping
New
York
times
reading
liberals
Conservatives
have
been
shoving
their
philosophy
down
Americans
throats
for
decades
as
if
it
were
the
one
true
American
faith
and
anyone
who
doesn't
agree
is
a
traitor
Nonetheless
get
ready
to
hear
more
of
these
stories
of
victimization
as
Republicans
begin
to
realize
that
conservatism
is
as
out
of
fashion
as
mullets
and
padded
shoulders
If
they
thought
they
were
being
victimized
when
they
ran
the
whole
government
and
were
feted
as
the
personification
of
Real
America
you
know
they
are
going
to
wallow
in
victimhood
as
if
being
a
conservative
is
akin
to
living
in
the
Warsaw
ghetto
once
they
are
out
of
power
For
reasons
that
probably
have
to
do
with
guilt
and
projection
they
seem
to
need
to
see
themselves
as
an
aggrieved
minority
I
say
let
them
follow
their
bliss

Ride
by

Don't
miss
Maeve
Reston's
revolting
hurl
in
the
LA
Times
recalling
the
halcyon
days
when
McCain
pampered
flattered
and
even
healed
his
media
entourage
It
really
can't
be
excerpted
you
need
to
experience
the
lurching
contractions
of
the
whole
retch
Many
of
you
may
be
embarrassed
or
even
repelled
at
Reston's
avid
enthusiasm
for
exposing
for
no
reason
whatsoever
her
truly
limitless
narcissism
and
negative
self-esteem
It
really
is
quite
remarkable
It's
all
her
fault
she
informs
us
that
the
Straight
Talk
Express
derailed
because
she
asked
an
awkward
question
of
St
John
McCain
on
video
tape
It's
like
reading
the
confession
of
one
of
those
cultists
in
the
homemade
skirts
married
to
that
polygamist
Memo
to
Maeve
It's
not
your
fault
Trust
me
Reston's
personality
type
is
ripe
for
exploitation
by
trained
manipulators
like
politicians
Sure
enough
during
her
embed
with
Papa
John
me-obsessed
Maeve
regressed
to
the
psychological
state
of
a
helpless
child
clingingly
dependent
upon
the
good
Daddy
the
other
man
in
her
life
not
to
mention
his
generous
supply
of
solicitious
aides
who
provided
her
with
band-aids
for
her
boo-boos
Think
I"m
making
this
up
Read
the
article
Even
though
you
and
I
may
perceive
Reston's
journalism
as
shoddy
to
the
point
of
corruption
I'm
sure
neither
her
nor
her
editors
think
of
it
that
way
Her
needy
personality
and
ambition
assured
her
access
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
people
in
the
world
And
that
provided
her
paper
with
close=up
portraits
of
the
Maverick
straight-shooterer
Where's
the
problem
The
problem
is
that
this
isn't
reporting
as
it
is
commonly
understood
but
merely
rank
publicity
flacking
Those
of
us
who
couldn't
care
less
about
McCain's
holiday
jaunts
in
the
rainforests
of
Costa
Rica
are
being
fed
hagiographic
bromides
rather
than
facts
It
is
impossible
to
get
a
sense
either
of
the
issues
or
the
temperament
of
the
politician
One
can't
blame
McCain
for
trying
I
suppose
to
seduce
the
press
rather
than
answer
questions
it
is
what
powerful
people
do
when
questioned
And
Reston
herself
comes
across
as
so
pitifully
insecure
it's
hard
for
me
to
get
too
angry
at
her
either
However
her
bosses
who
aided
and
abetted
this
abusive
relationship
abusive
that
is
to
the
readers
of
the
Times
who
are
looking
to
be
informed
about
the

a
heckuva
lot

Flipping
by
tristero
It's
not
an
urban
myth
Notice
that
after
the
machine
gets
calibrated
it
still
flipped
a
vote
As
I've
mentioned
several
times
my
elderly
parents
were
victims
of
the
infamous
butterfly
ballot
down
in
Florida
We're
pretty
sure
that
my
mom
ended
up
voting
accidentally
for
Buchanan
while
my
father
probably
voted
for
Gore
Both
intended
to
vote
for
Gore
but
got
confused
While
both
my
parents
were
in
full
possession
of
their
mental
faculties
this
was
a
highly
disorienting
experience
for
them
The
gadget
in
this
video
is
no
better
The
out-of-calibration
machine
demonstrated
on
this
video
would
if
used
in
the
election
surely
confuse
many
voters
who
wouldn't
think
to
inform
an
official
or
might
be
too
embarrassed
to
do
so
Proofreading
a
long
printout
of
voter
choices
also
adds
needless
redundancy
and
complication
I
don't
know
what
the
solution
is
but
I
do
know
that
these
machines
are
not
it
Meanwhile
it
is
important
to
stress
what
may
seem
obvious
to
many
of
us
Everyone
who
votes
should
check
and
doublecheck
their
ballot
to
make
sure
that
the
machine
has
properly
registered
their
vote
And
needless
to
say
clear
accurate
voting
technology
should
have
a
place
of
priority
on
all
progressives

long

That

I've
really
felt
that
our

is

Very
very

I
do
have
to
add
another
shout
out
to
Brad
Friedman
who
is
our
resident
blogospheric

on
all

of
electoral
integrity
and
is
the
ultimate

Now
that
we've
invited
everyone
into
the
big

it

like
some
people
aren't
going
to
be
welcome
anymore
At
least
if
they
want

Pastor
Dan
reports
Rick
Warren
Endorses
Proposition
8
I
thought
about
giving
Warren
the
nod
for
the
coveted
Wanker
Of
The
Day
Award
But
then
I
realized
that
he's
just
doing
what
comes
naturally
to
him
even
if
as
Randall
Balmer
points
out
it's
not
true
to
his
Baptist
roots
The
real
problem
here
is
the
endless
parade
of
Religious-Industrial
Complex
consultants
and
activists
who
tell
us
that
Rick
Warren
is
the
epitome
of
the
moderate
Evangelical
that
Democrats
should
be
working
to
attract
The
only
problem
is
it
doesn't
work
Cameron

was

Randy
Brinson
worked
for
Mike
Huckabee
this
spring
and
runs
what's
left
of
Alabama's
chapter
of
the
Christian
Coalition
Joel
Hunter
endorsed
Huckabee
in
the
primaries
and
has
pledged
himself
to
maintaining
a
socially
conservative
platform
Even
the
venerable
Jim
Wallis
won't
describe
himself
as
part
of
a
religious
left
Moving
away
from
strictly
Evangelicals
Doug
Kmiec
is
still
an
authoritarian
Catholic
You
just
wait
On
the
morning
after
the
election
we
will
see
all
these
so-called
Christians
and
their
lobbyists
rushing
to
take
credit
for
the
election
and
telling
everyone
that
it
proves
America
is
basically
socially
conservative
That's
what
they
always
do
whether
Democrats
or
Republicans
win
the
thing
All
these
alleged
Republican
apostates
will
make
the
case
that
they
are
right
there
with
Obama
on
everything
except
you
know,stuff
like
civil
liberties
and
civil
rights
Nobody
wants
any
more
of
that
obviously
Pastor
Dan
gives
the
correct
analysis
of
the
problem
So
while
Rick
Warren
may
be
a
useful
ally
on
issues
such
as
poverty
he
is
nothing
like
a
progressive
Seeking
to
bring
him
or
members
of
his
congregation
into
the
Democratic
party
only
serves
to
drag
the
party
rightward
on
social
issues
Coalitions
are
fun
and
all
but
sometimes
they
need
to
be
built
around
issues
rather
than
elections.Of
course
Democrats
and
liberals
can
work
with
these
people
on
issues
of
common
interest
What
they
cannot
do
is
keep
whittling
away
at
their
fundamental
principles
in
a
quixotic
quest
to
bring
these
people
into
their
electoral
coalition
It
won't
work
Besides
it's
not
like
there
aren't
plenty
of
religious
leaders
who
are
actually
tolerant
and
compassionate

A
Democratic
Era
by
digby
All
through
this
election
cycle
I've
been
featuring
reports
from
an
insider
I
call
Deep
Insight
This
is
the
final
one
Democracy
is
coming
to
the
USA
Leonard
Cohen
With
one
week
left
to
go
before
the
election
it
certainly
looks
like
a
greater
measure
of
accountability
will
arrive
soon
Of
course
after
the
last
eight
years
of
government
by
oligarchy
cronyism
and
rightwing
ideology
any
democratic
accountability
would
be
novel
George
Bush
is
the
proximate
cause
of
a
putative
federal
progressive
majority
after
November
4th
It
is
obvious
the
political
landscape
has
been
radically
altered
in
the
last
month
The
meltdown
in
the
capital
markets
and
the
freeze
of
the
credit
markets
has
led
a
Republican
Administration
to
nationalize
a
significant
portion
of
the
mortgage
industry
a
major
insurer
and
invest
in
the
major
banks
The
explosion
of
unregulated
portions
of
the
capital
markets
was
predicted
years
ago
by
major
financial
figures
like
Warren
Buffett
and
George
Soros
but
the
government
waited
until
the
unraveling
was
well
underway
Alan
Greenspan
the
disciple
of
philosopher
Ayn
Rand
was
shocked
about
problems
with
credit
default
swaps
and
the
greed
of
Wall
Street
Of
course
as
Fed
Chief
he
fought
vigorously
against
any
new
regulation
of
financial
markets
The
malfeasance
and
crime
on
Wall
Street
has
claimed
many
innocent
victims
worldwide
The
current
blurred
line
between
Goldman
Sachs
and
the
Treasury
Department
is
also
very
unsettling
The
public
is
reacting
in
both
disbelief
and
anger
as
retirement
savings
are
washed
away
Any
economic
progress
over
the
past
several
years
has
been
revealed
as
a
Potemkin
village
Median
wages
already
lower
than
in
2000
will
head
lower
Five
million
more
Americans
are
below
the
poverty
line
than
in
2000
Real
hardship
is
underway
for
many
The
economic
upheaval
has
driven
George
Bush's
approval
rating
back
into
the
20s
far
lower
than
even
the
number
of
Americans
who
believe
the
words
in
the
Bible
are
literally
true
The
country
wants
him
gone
now
Nine
percent
of
the
public
currently
thinks
the
country
is
on
the
right
track
Again
this
is
an
historic
number
Barack
Obama
is
the
obvious
beneficiary
of
this
shift
in
the
political
dynamic
His
steady
performance
in
the
debates
and
on
the
stump
has
allowed
him
to
pass
the
threshold
for
a
President
He
now
easily
trumps
McCain
not
only
on
the
economy
but
also
on
leadership
He
surpasses
the
old
taunt
against
FDR
by
possessing
both
a
first
class
temperament
and
a
first
class
mind
Despite
all
the
smears
from
the
GOP
Obama
has
increased
his
favorability
rating
during
the
course
of
the
year
He
is
wearing
well
with
the
majority
of
the
public
The
financial
advantage
enjoyed
by
the
Obama
campaign
is
evident
both
in
an
unprecedented
Election
Day
operation
and
the
massive
communication
campaign
At
the
end
of
the
day
however
any
ads
pale
in
importance
to
the
real
world
unraveling
of
the
GOP
ideology
Senator
McCain
has
reaped
the
whirlwind
of
conservative
economic
policy
McCain's
erratic
behavior
during
the
market
meltdown
raised
new
doubts
about
his
competence
and
temperament
At
that
point
the
Presidential
race
shifted
inexorably
Not
only
did
the
atmosphere
become
more
toxic
for
Republicans
but
also
McCain's
words
and
actions
were
somewhat
inexplicable
except
as
a
media
stunt
Karl
Rove
once
remarked
that
modern
politics
is
TV
with
the
sound
off
There
is
a
kernel
of
truth
in
this
cynical
view
and
John
McCain
was
damaged
both
with
the
sound
off
and
on
in
three
debates
In
the
most
recent
New
York
Times
poll
McCain
had
a
36/45-favorable/unfavorable
rating
This
judgment
incorporates
both
the
public's
consideration
of
Senator
McCain's
temperament
and
his
positions
on
the
issues
He
seems
to
be
a
very
angry
man
Sarah
Palin
may
have
excited
the
evangelical
base
of
the
GOP
but
her
incompetence
in
answering
simple
questions
from
Katie
Couric
sent
many
swing
voters
running
for
the
exits
She
was
clever
to
go
on
Saturday
Night
Live
She
had
totally
lost
control
of
her
public
image
to
Tina
Fey
and
at
least
she
proved
she
could
take
a
joke
Maybe
she
has
a
show
business
future
for
as
long
as
the
teleprompter
works
she
is
persuasive
She
exaggerates
effectively
in
part
to
hide
her
extreme
views
Her
unfavorability
rating
is
now
41
and
she
has
become
a
major
drag
on
John
McCain
With
her
pick
he
threw
the
experience
and
judgment
cards
out
the
window
Some
anonymous
sources
in
the
McCain
camp
have
already
thrown
her
under
the
bus
The
GOP
civil
war
has
begun
before
a
vote
is
counted
She
and
McCain
though
tag
team
with
their
character
assaults
of
Senator
Obama
The
current
theme
is
that
Obama
is
a
socialist
with
a
history
of
bad
associates
and
also
one
who
loves
welfare
Some
conservative
members
of
Congress
have
reprised
McCarthy
era
themes
No
doubt
the
smear
campaign
against
Senator
Obama
has
reinforced
some
wavering
on
the
right
but
it
has
also
caused
a
steady
decline
in
McCain's
favorability
ratings
In
the
Internet
age
a
lie
can
be
fact
checked
and
rebutted
in
minutes
The
news
cycle
now
is
calculated
in
hours
not
days
Of
course
when
your
issue
program
consists
of
a
continuation
of
very
unpopular
policies
one
is
hemmed
in
McCain
now
makes
the
argument
that
only
he
can
stop
Nancy
Pelosi
and
Harry
Reid
from
driving
the
nation
over
the
cliff
Unfortunately
for
this
argument
the
GOP
has
already
accomplished
this
plummet
The
Republicans
are
out
of
substantive
arguments
Fear
lies
and
misplaced
nostalgia
are
the
only
arrows
left
in
their
quiver
The
GOP
is
now
trying
to
limit
the
damage
through
voter
suppression
Party
operatives
and
officials
are
working
full
time
to
limit
voter
participation
by
Democratic
constituencies
Their
full
tactical
suppression
arsenal
is
on
display
This
will
also
be
the
GOP
strategy
on
November
4th
build
long
lines
on
Election
Day
through
voter
challenges
Democrats
and
progressive
allies
have
to
be
prepared
for
chaos
Florida
officials
have
managed
to
have
2-hour
early
voting
lines
however
early
voting
in
several
states
has
been
very
heavy
and
in
the
Democrats
favor
Hopefully
more
touch
screen
machines
will
soon
be
phased
out
since
they
can
be
easily
hacked
There
are
already
reports
of
machines
in
West
Virginia
registering
for
McCain
when
voters
are
going
for
Obama
As
far
as
I
know
there
have
been
no
reports
of
anyone
attempting
to
vote
for
a
Republican
and
having
the
machine
register
for
a
Democrat
It
certainly
makes
one
wonder
Some
day
the
U.S
may
have
a
safe
and
convenient
registration
and
election
system
say
like
Canada
Senator
Obama's
showing
in
the
polls
has
put
him
consistently
near
or
over
50
He
has
maintained
a
steady
4-6
lead
for
the
last
month
This
is
enough
for
a
clear
Electoral
College
victory
Some
polls
with
the
most
accurate
2004
records
like
Mason
Dixon
have
the
race
much
closer
No
doubt
there
will
be
surprises
both
in
the
turnout
in
under
polled
youth
and
minorities
as
well
as
the
drag
of
those
undecided
who
would
not
tell
a
pollster
their
true
feelings
about
Obama's
race
There
is
historical
evidence
involving
African
American
candidates
that
a
large
majority
of
the
late
undecided
voters
will
likely
stay
home
or
vote
for
McCain

Down

in
the

and
Senate
The
Chamber
of
Commerce
is
spending
at
least
35
million
to
help
Republicans
in
the
Senate
Democrats
now
appear
to
have
a
minimum
of
five
seats
in
their
column
and
a
pick
up
of
seven
or
eight
is
in
sight
Senate
In
Virginia
Mark
Warner
and
New
Mexico
Tom
Udall

races
are

of

Democrats
hold
single-digit
leads
in
the
races
in
New

Shaheen
North

Kay
Hagen
and
early

third-party

Minnesota
but

Democrat
Al
Franken

ahead
within
the

Alaska
should
also
be
over
now
that
the
guilty
verdicts
for
incumbent
Republican
Uncle
Ted
Stevens
are
complete
Mississippi
is
within
the
margin
of
error
for
former
Democratic
governor
Ronnie
Musgrove
In
Kentucky
Republican
Mitch
McConnell
has
plenty
of
money
to
hang
on
to
his
seat
but
he
has
a
spirited
challenger
The
polling
shows
only
a
narrow
lead
for
McConnell
The
surprise
race
is
in
Georgia
where
without
significant
national
money
Democratic
challenger
Jim
Martin
has
moved
within
striking
distance
of
incumbent
Saxby
Chambliss
Even
if
Martin
falls
short
it
is
forcing
the
GOP
to
spend
scarce
dollars
The
only
Democrat
who
was
thought
to
have
any
difficulty
Mary
Landrieu

There
needs

or

Maine
Nebraska

Oklahoma
for
the
underdog
Democrats
to
win
there
House
This
is
the
opportunity
to
put
as
many
progressives
in
Congress
as
possible
The
underlying
fundamentals
have
not
been
so
favorable
for
the
Democrats
since
1974
Winning
any
open
seats
in
2010
will
generally
be
more
difficult
and
expensive
Protecting
good
incumbents
during
redistricting
in
2012
will
also
be
easier
There
are
50
Republican
incumbent
or
open
seats
in
play
in
all
of
which
the
Republican
candidate
is
under
50
In
1994
any
Democrat
who
was
under
50
after
Labor
Day
lost
in
November
and
the
public
mood
is
worse
for
the
GOP
now
than
it
was
for
the
Democrats
in
1994
It
seems
quite
possible
the
Democrats
will
only
lose
a
couple
of
their
seats
A
25
seat
pick
up
now
seems
reasonable
and
30
or
so
new
seats
are
possible
At
this
point
the
Democrats
are
reaching
deep
into
suburbia
and
exurbia
Some
of
the
new
members
may
be
moderates
But
the
Republicans
these
candidates
would
be
replacing
a
Robin
Hayes
in
North
Carolina
or
Michelle
Bachman
in
Minnesota
are
truly
awful
There
is
real
potential
for
the
most
liberal
White
House
with
the
House
and
Senate
since
1965
The
collapsing
economy
and
exploding
deficit
will
likely
constrain
expensive
federal
initiatives
There
may
be
only
a
short
window
for
the
Democrats
to
produce
real
improvement
and
opportunity
for
the
majority
of
the
public
This
means
gains
in
both
the
job
market
and
wages
As
the
remaining
Republicans
in
the
next
Congress
will
be
even
more
rightwing
there
will
be
very
little
cooperation
on
policy
There
will
be
constant
attacks
on
Democrats
as
tax-and-spend
liberals
Even
before
any
potential
Obama
inaugural
the
rightwing
communications
infrastructure
will
undermine
him
The
Beltway
elite
however
is
issuing
calls
for
bi-partisanship
Expect
this
to
be
a
constant
refrain
from
the
Washington
Post
This
is
rich
as
the
same
group
was
silent
as
Bush
and
the
rightwing
in
Congress
ran
wild
for
six
years
Hopefully
a
President
Obama
and
the
Democrats
will
respectfully
ignore
their
suggestions
This
should
be
the
start
of
a
Democratic
era

Roger

says
that
Palin
is
going
to
run
in
2012
and
all
this
bad
press
will
have
been
explained
away
as
sexism
And
here
we
have
an
alleged
feminist
making
a
similar
case
You
have
to
love
the
nasty
opening
It's
difficult
not
to
froth
when
one
reads
as
I
did
again
and
again
this
week
doubts
about
Sarah
Palin's
intelligence
coming
especially
from
women
such
as
PBS's
Bonnie
Erbe
who
as
near
as
I
recall
has
not
herself
heretofore
been
burdened
with
the
Susan

moniker.Nice
She
goes

As
Fred
Barnes
God
help
me
I'm
agreeing
with
Fred
Barnes
suggests
in
the
Weekly
Standard
these
high
toned
and
authoritative
dismissals
come
from
people
who
have
never
met
or
spoken
with
Sarah
Palin
Those
who
know
her
love
her
or
hate
her
offer
no
such
criticism
They
know
what
I
know
and
I
learned
it
from
spending
just
a
little
time
traveling
on
the
cramped
campaign
plane
this
week
Sarah
Palin
is
very
smart
Here's
the
thing
There
are
probably
many
people
who
are
smart
once
you
know
them
personally
but
politicians
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
project
their
intelligence
to
the
vast
public
You
shouldn't
have
to
share
a
beer
or
a
mooseburger
with
them
to
know
that
when
they
say
stupid
things
in
public
it's
not
because
they
are
stupid
but
rather
what
Completely
uninterested
in
current
events
Is
that
supposed
to
be
something
we
should
overlook
Now
I'll
grant
that
George
W
Bush
gave
the
Republicans
every
reason
to
believe
that
appearing
to
be
dumb
as
a
post
would
be
no
detriment
to
winning
national
office
And
he
did
get
a
freer
pass
than
Palin
But
I'm
hard
pressed
to
speak
out
for
a
female
politician's
right
to
be
as
ignorant
as
George
W
Bush
Palin
was
an
unknown
and
the
first
woman
on
a
Republican
presidential
ticket
and
it
wasn't
very
smart
of
her
to
not
be
prepared
to
even
answer
soft
ball
questions
about
what
she
reads
or
come
up
blank
when
asked
about
the
Bush
Doctrine
I'm
sorry
it's
just
not
sexist
to
be
unimpressed
with
a
female
politician
who
cannot
demonstrate
the
most
rudimentary
knowledge
of
politics
government
and
current
events
Indeed
it's
an
embarrassment
to
women
everywhere
that
she
would
put
herself
in
that
position
and
be
seen
byto
represent
the
best
and
the
brightest
of
women
in
the
country
It
makes
it
that
much
harder
for
the
next
one
There
have
certainly
been
sexist
smears
against
her
Calling
her
a
Diva
for
instance
rather
than
simply
saying
she's
not
a
team
player
but
that's
coming
from
the
Republicans
Frankly
they
were
nothing
to
what
the
press
rolled
out
against
Clinton
in
the
primaries
and
I
would
guess
that
the
feminist
outcry
against
that
behavior
was
largely
what
has
kept
Palin
from
getting
much
worse
than
she
has
The
criticisms
of
her
have
largely
been
substantive
and
reasonable
There
is
no
double
standard
on
the
wardrobe
cost
issue
ask
John
Edwards
But
this
is
really
delusional
Last
month
a
prominent
feminist
blogger
echoing
that
sensibility
declared
that
the
media
was
wrongly
buying
into
the
false
idea
that
Palin
was
a
feminist
Why
Well
just
because
she
said
she
was
a
feminist
because
she
supported
women's
rights
and
opportunities
equal
pay
Title
IV
that
was
just
empty
rhetoric
they
said
At
least
the
blogger
didn't
go
as
far
as
NOW's
Kim
Gandy
and
declare
that
Palin
was
not
a
woman
Bottom
line
you
are
not
a
feminist
until
we
say
you
are
And
there
you
have
the
formula
for
diminishing
what
was
once
a
great
and
important
mass
social
change
movement
to
an
exclusionary
club
that
rejects
women
who
sincerely
want
to
join
and
God
forbid
grow
to
lead
But
here
is
the
good
news
women
citizens
of
America's
high
and
low
culture
the
Economist
and
People
magazine
readers
will
get
it
They
got
it
with
Hillary
even
when
feminist
leaders
were
not
supporting
her
or
doing
so
half-heartedly
Yes
Palin
is
a
harder
sell
she
looks
and
sounds
different
and
one
can
rightfully
oppose
her
based
on
abortion
policies
If
you
only
vote
on
how
a
person
personally
feels
about
abortion
you
will
never
want
her
to
darken
your
door
If
you
care
about
anything
else
she
will
continue
to
intrigue
you
As
Time's
Nancy
Gibbs
noted
a
few
weeks
ago
quoting
bioethicist
Tom
Murray
Sympathy
and
subtlety
are
seasonings
rarely
applied
to
political
red
meat
Will
Palin's
time
come
next
week
I
don't
know
But
her
time
will
come
I
don't
have
any
idea
what
she's
talking
about
with
the
sympathy
and
subtlety
quip
but
the
rest
is
unadulterated
bullshit
She
only
intrigues
neanderthals
And
there
is
no
one
more
exclusionary
than
a
right
winger
Palin
is
no
feminist
except
to
the
extent
that
she
is
willing
to
walk
through
all
the
doors
that
feminists
opened
up
before
her
and
them
slam
them
shut
on
the
girls
coming
behind
her
She
is
from
the
far
right
of
the
Republican
party
where
they
would
see
women
as
permanent
second
class
citizens
at
the
mercy
of
their
reproductive
tracts
and
able
to
succeed
only
to
the
extent
that
some
man
allows
them
to
She
caters
to
fundamentalist
throwbacks
whose
adherence
to
their
so-called
traditional
values
always
seems
to
result
in
women
getting
the
shaft
And
it
must
have
escaped
this
allegedly
intelligent
woman
that
Obama
is
getting
far
more
of
the
female
vote
than
Palin
The
female
Clinton
voters
were
appalled
that
the
Republicans
thought
for
a
moment
that
they
would
be
appeased
with
someone
who
is
a
cipher
compared
to
the
competent
and
well-informed
feminist
Clinton
McCain
clearly
hoped
that
having
a
woman
on
the
ticket
would
sway
Clinton
voters
But
Clinton
voters
here
said
Palin
is
beyond
the
pale
In
many
cases
her
very
selection
accelerated
their
support
of
Obama
Carol
Kunz
a
42-year-old

To
compare
the
two
women
is
insulting
to
women
everywhere
Christine

Palin's

my

How
could
any
Hillary
voter
align
herself
with
Palin?"Carol
Crowell
of
Haverhill
a
46-year-old
executive
editor
in
educational
publishing
said
My
husband
voted
for
Hillary
too
But
the
idea
that
Hillary
supporters
would
support
someone
the
political
polar
opposite
from
Hillary
on
healthcare
education
and
ending
the
war
just
because
they're
women
is
crazy
Just
being
a
woman
who
made
it
in
a
man's
world
doesn't
make
you
a
feminist
Some
of
the
worst
anti-feminists
I've
ever
known
were
women
I
worked
for
and
one
of
the
most
committed
feminists
was
a
man
Being
a
feminist
is
not
determined
by
what
genitalia
you
have
but
rather
the
principles
for
which
you
fight
Palin's
priorities
are
obvious
She's
more
interested
aerial
wolf
hunting
than
she
is
in
woman's
equality
I
don't
know
if
she
will
flame
out
or
if
she
will
end
up
being
the
second
coming
of
Abraham
Lincoln
But
whatever
happens
the
fact
remains
that
she
got
to
where
she
was
because
of
feminism
but
not
because
she
was
a
feminist
She
walked
on
all
our
backs
so
she
could
step
on
our
throats
She's
a
typical

This
should
scare
you
Earlier
this
month
Mr
Bush
pointed
with
pride
to
his
record
at
a
conference
sponsored
by
the
Cincinnati
chapter
of
the
Federalist
Society
the
elite
network
for
the
conservative

noted
that

of
the
federal
judiciary
expected
to
be
serving
when
he
leaves
office
a
lifetime-tenured
force
that
will
influence
society
for
decades
and
represents
one
of
his
most

Mr
Bush's
judges
were
among
the
youngest
ever
nominated
and
are
poised
to

an
unusually
strong

They
have
arrived
at
a
time
when
the
appeals
courts
which

tens
of

of

a

are
increasingly
getting
the
last
word
While
the
Supreme

gets

more
attention
in
recent
terms
it
has
reviewed
only
about
75
cases
a
year
half
what
it
considered

And
Mr

have
found

in

now

They

Good
Time
For
An
Enormous
Gaffe
On
Health
Care
by
dday
Douglas
Holtz-Eakin
earned
a
reputation
in
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
as
a
fairly
honest
conservative
economist
Today
he
told
the
truth
about
John
McCain's
health
care
plan
Experts
however
fear
that
eliminating
the
tax
advantage
of
employer-based
coverage
would
prompt
younger
healthier
workers
to
leave
their
office
plans
If
that
happened
costs
for
the
remaining
workers
could
skyrocket
Companies
may
drop
coverage
altogether
If
companies
know
their
employees
have
the
tax
credit
it
relieves
them
of
the
burden
of
providing
coverage
said
Sara
Collins
who
directs
a
health
insurance
program
at
the
Commonwealth
Fund
McCain's
plan
moves
people
out
of
the
employer
system
and
to
the
individual
market
McCain
advisers
counter
these
concerns
Changing
the
tax
treatment
wouldn't
hurt
the
employer-sponsored
system
and
would
allow
more
of
the
uninsured
to
buy
their
own
coverage
they
say
Also
his
advisers
say
a
McCain
administration
would
keep
an
eye
on
the
credit
to
make
sure
it
didn't
lag
behind
the
cost
of
coverage
while
also
working
to
lower
the
rate
of
medical
inflation
Younger
healthier
workers
likely
wouldn't
abandon
their
company-sponsored
plans
said
Douglas
Holtz-Eakin
McCain's
senior
economic
policy
adviser
Why
would
they
leave
said
Holtz-Eakin
What
they
are
getting
from
their
employer
is
way
better
than
what
they
could
get
with
the
credit
Ay
caramba
Holtz-Eakin
is
basically
saying
that
the
individual
health
insurance
market
is
crap
and
the
employer
market
is
more
preferable
because
it
provides
more
That's
elementary
since
it
pools
resources
to
get
a
better
deal
But
of
course
the
entire
McCain
health
care
plan
seeks
to
get
people
AWAY
from
the
employer
system
and
into
the
individual
market
Jason
Rosenbaum
explains
Of
course
tying
health
care
to
employment
is
the
way
we've
done
things
in
America
for
generations
and
it
turns
out
it's
also
pretty
popular
Not
to
mention
that
insurance
companies
have
to
cover
you
through
an
employer
health
care
plan
while
they
can
deny
you
for
pre-existing
conditions
on
the
individual
market
And
so
in
the
face
of
political
pressure
you
have
Douglas
Holtz-Eakin
admitting
the
truth
Faced
with
the
fact
that
destroying
our
employer-based
health
care
system
isn't
exactly
a
priority
for
most
Americans
he
argues
that
the
McCain
plan
wouldn't
actually
destroy
the
employer-based
system
Why
Because
the
tax
credit
McCain
is
offering
wouldn't
buy
a
decent
health
care
plan
even
for
the
young
and
healthy
Let's
unpack
this
a
little
bit
more
According
to
Holtz-Eakin
John
McCain
doesn't
actually
want
to
dismantle
the
employer-based
health
care
system
But
McCain's
plan
would
tax
any
health
benefits
you'd
get
through
work
So
if
Holtz-Eakin
is
right
in
saying
you'd
get
better
coverage
through
work
than
you'd
get
with
the
tax
credit
on
the
individual
market
and
he
probably
is
and
if
he's
right
in
saying
most
workers
won't
drop
their
employer-based
insurance
for
the
individual
market
because
they're
getting
a
better
deal
at
work
then
John
McCain
is
simply
proposing
a
tax
on
your
current
health
care
benefits
without
giving
you
anything
in
return
That's
the
worst
kind
of
tax
increase
There's
also
the
issue
of
employers
cutting
out
of
the
system
because
of
the
loss
of
incentives
to
provide
health
care
too
The
best
part
of
this
is
how
the
Obama
campaign
is
going
after
it
This
morning
the
McCain
campaign's
top
economic
policy
advisor
unleashed
an
October
Surprise
of
straight
talk
when
he
finally
admitted
that
the
health
insurance
people
currently
get
from
their
employer
is
way
better
than
the
health
care
they
would
get
if
John
McCain
becomes
President
Independent
studies
have
shown
that
under
John
McCain's
health
care
plan
at
least
20
million
Americans
will
lose
the
insurance
they
rely
on
and
be
forced
to
buy
health
care
coverage
on
the
individual
market
that
costs
more
than
12,000
with
a
tax
credit
of
just
5,000
Senator
McCain
has
been
trying
to
cover
this
up
for
months
but
his
advisor's
brutal
honesty
today
is
certainly
better
late
than
never
and
it
should
give
every
American
pause
about
electing
a
candidate
who
has
proposed
such
radical
and
dangerous
changes
to
our
health
care
system
said
Obama-Biden
Spokesman
Bill
Burton
Obama
has
put
a
significant
amount
of
money
into
talking
about
health
care
with
a
whopping
68
of
his
TV
ads
devoted
at
least
in
part
to
the
issue
including
86
in
October
That
shows
you
that
the
potential
is
there
to
make
reform
an
urgent
priority
Our
health
care
crisis
is
tied
to
the
economic
woes
of
the
country
US
companies
are
less
competitive
than
their
counterparts
abroad
because
they
have
to
also
be
a
giant
HMO
skyrocketing
costs
are
putting
a
giant
hole
in
the
federal
budget
and
treating
the
uninsured
costs
everyone
in
increased
premiums
So
far
Obama's
spent
lots
of
time
defining
McCain's
dangerous
health
care
plan
but
less
on
his
own
After
the
election
there
needs
to
be
massive
education
around
this
issue
McCain
has
steered
the
election
to
ground
where
it
really
has
become
a
referendum
on
progressive
policies
progressive
taxation
government
investment
in
energy
and
infrastructure
diplomacy
versus
militarism
and
the
need
to
rein
in
the
free
market
This
mandate
needs
to
carry
into
health
care
policy
as
well
The
Republicans
know
that
a
Democratic
Party
giving
Americans
universal
health
care
would
be
strong
for
decades
and
will
stop
at
nothing
to
block
it
Even
some
employers
are
willing
to
fight
against
it
even
though
it's
not
in
their
economic
interest
We
have
a
responsibility
on
many
fronts
but
especially
on
health
care
to
steer
the
argument
and
make
sure
that
we
meet
progressive
policy
goals
and
not
just
cheer
because
our
home
team
makes
it

This
statement
should
be
the
basis
for
serious
congressional
investigations
The
overblown
histrionics
about
ACORN
do
not
surprise
those
of
us
who
have
been
watching
the
RNC's
election
manipulation
antics
For
eight
years
White
House
operatives
have
been
trying
to
gin
up
press
stories
about
voter
fraud
David
Iglesias
of
New
Mexico
was
one
of
seven
U.S
Attorneys
fired
by
the
White
House
for
their
refusal
to
bring
voter
fraud
prosecutions
We
took
over
100
complaints
from
the
GOP
he
told
us
We
investigated
for
almost
2
years
I
didn't
find
one
prosecutable
voter
fraud
case
in
the
entire
state
of
New
Mexico
Iglesias
a
McCain
supporter
has
for
the
first
time
leveled
a
new
and
serious
charge
Despite
finding
none
of
the
200
voters
guilty
he
says
the
White
House
nevertheless
ordered
him
to
illegally
prosecute
baseless
cases
against
innocent
citizens
just
to
gin
up
voter
fraud
publicity
His
refusal
he
says
cost
him
his
job
They
were
looking
for
politicized
for
improperly
politicized
US
attorneys
to
file
bogus
voter
fraud
cases
There
will
never
be
a
better
opening
for
the
Democrats
to
fix
the
electoral
system
and
expose
the
sophisticated
GOP
vote
suppression
and
propaganda
program
than
now
The
US
Attorney
scandal
was
never
fully
dealt
with
and
it
needs
to
be
if
we
hope
to
have
fair
elections
in
the
future
The
Republicans
have
a
very
well
funded
professional
operation
developed
over
years
to
keep
Democrats
from
voting
and
to
brainwash
local
election
officials
If
the
race
isn't
close
enough
to
win
it
by
vote
suppression
and
intimidation
they
will
have
laid
the
groundwork
to
call
the
legitimacy
of
the
outcome
into
question
to
justify
total
obstruction
of
the
mandate
And
they
have
the
nerve
to
say
that
ACORN
is
destroying
the
fabric
of
democracy
One
of
the
purposes
of
having
political
power
is
to
use
it
to
ensure
your
future
political
survival
It
doesn't
have
to
be
underhanded
or
illegal
indeed
in
this
case
protecting
the
franchise
protects
the
Democratic
Party
If
that
weren't
true
the
conservatives
wouldn't
work
so
hard
to
keeping
people
from
voting
The
Democrats
are
suckers
if
they
don't
take
the
opportunity
of
an
historic
win
with
no
sour
grapes
involved
to
clean
this
up
This
meme
about
voter
fraud
is

Every
year
the
Republican
Party
sends
a
flier
into
minority
or
poor
neighborhoods
telling
people
to
vote
on
the
wrong
day
This
one
is
even
more
efficient
because
it
claims
that
Virginia
modified
their
laws
to
have
Republicans
vote
on
November
4
and
Democrats
on
November
5
That
way
they

Mmm
that's
some
delicious

And
then
there's
this
a
pretty
novel
case
of
ballot-stealing
Three
Hialeah
voters
say
they
had
an
unusual
visitor
at
their
homes
last
week
a
man
who
called
himself
Juan
offering
to
help
them
fill
out
their
absentee
ballots
and
deliver
them
to
the
elections
office
The
voters
all
supporters
of
Democratic
congressional
candidate
Raul
Martinez
said
they
gave
their
ballots
to
the
man
after
he
told
them
he
worked
for
Martinez
But
the
Martinez
campaign
said
he
doesn't
work
for
them
Juan
told
me
not
to
worry
that
they
normally
collected
all
the
ballots
and
waited
until
they
had
a
stack
big
enough
to
hand-deliver
to
the
elections
department
said
voter
Jesus
Hernandez
73
He
said
Don't
worry
This
is
not
going
to
pass
through
the
mail
to
get
lost
Hernandez
said
he
worries
his
ballot
was
stolen
or
destroyed
He
and
two
other
voters
told
The
Miami
Herald
that
the
man
was
dispatched
by
a
woman
caller
who
also
said
she
worked
for
Martinez
But
the
phone
number
cited
by
the
voters
traces
back
to
a
consultant
working
for
Martinez's
rival
Republican
congressman
Lincoln
Diaz-Balart
Martinez's
campaign
manager
Jeff
Garcia
has
asked
the
Miami-Dade
state
attorney's
office
to
investigate
Wow
That's
breathtaking
criminality
The
Republicans
are
going
to
do
everything
they
can
to
make
sure
that
if
you're
a
Democrat
you
don't
vote
this
year
Not
all
of
it
will
work
the
stories
of
young
workers
who
probably
need
the
money
walking
off
the
job
at
call
centers
rather
than
read
smear
call
scripts
against
Barack
Obama
are
inspiring
And
the
GOP
is
consistently
losing
in
the
courts
But
they
clearly
have
other
means
as
you
can
see
above
and
some
will
be
effective

it

Proposition
Hate
Meet
The
Funders
by
tristero
In
a
previous
post
on
the
anti-marriage
initiative
in
California
called
Proposition
8
aka
Prop
Hate
I
discussed
one
funder
of
this
hateful
proposal
the
odious
Howard
Ahmanson
a
well-known
christianist
extremist
Now
here's
another
the
less-well-known
Vineyard
Group
of
Mesa
AZ
who
donated
35,000
to
the
National
Organization
for
Marriage
of
Princeton
NJ
one
of
the
prime
movers
behind
Prop
Hate
Email
me
if
you
need
back
up
for
this
Turns
out
that
Broc
Hiatt
of
the
Vineyard
Group
is
a
director
of
the
Institute
for
American
Values
a
think
tank
that
runs
websites
like
The
Happiest
Wives
where
we
learn
that
among
other
things
a
breadwinning
husband
wives
who
stay
at
home
and
shared
religious
attendance
make
for
Stepford
contented
wives
Perhaps
the
oddest
criteria
for
happy
wives
however
is
traditional
gender
attitudes
Wives
who
hold
more
traditional
gender
attitudes
e.g
who
believe
that
wives
should
focus
more
on
nurturing/homemaking
and
husbands
should
focus
more
on
breadwinning
are
happier
than
wives
who
hold
more
feminist
attitudes
One
reason
this
may
be
the
case
is
that
traditional-minded
wives
probably
have
lower
expectations
of
what
their
husbands
can
and
should
do
for
them
emotionally
and
practically
We
also
find
that
more
traditional-minded
wives
spend
more
quality
time
with
their
husbands
perhaps
because
they
are
less
likely
to
argue
with
their
husbands
about
housework
and
childcare.Right
If
you
want
a
happy
marriage
expect
little
to
nothing
from
your
hubby
and
don't
argue
Just
as
long
as
he
stays
out
of
the
house
working
his
butt
off
In
other
words
the
people
behind
Prop
Hate
aren't
promoting
marriage
in
general
but
a
particular
kind
of
marriage
A
patriarchy
of
the
kind
literally
illustrated
on
their
website
And
again
as
noted
in
my
previous
post
the
role
that
they
assign
to
religion
in
this
kind
of
marriage
brings
up
disturbing
church/state
issues
in
the
Prop
Hate
initiative
Broc
Hiatt's
think
tank
has
some
other
papers
worth
perusing
to
get
an
idea
of
who
these
people
are
One
of
the
stranger
is
this
one
The
Consequences
of
Marriage
for
African
Americans
which
opines
There
are
racial
differences
in
the
consequences
of
marriage
All
in
all
Black
women
appear
to
receive
a
smaller
marriage
premium
than
White
women
Black
men
appear
to
receive
a
smaller
marriage
premium
only
in
terms
of
their
satisfaction
with
family
life
A
major
reason
for
these
differentials
is
that
marriages
of
African
Americans
are
on
average
of
lower
quality
than
those
of
Whites
Let's
take
this
at
face
value
as
William
Raspberry
did
and
not
as
racist
cant
Nevertheless
he
was
struck
by
this
finding
in
the
full
report
which
somehow
did
not
make
it
into
the
executive
summary
available
online
Our
research
finds
that
marriage
brings
small
health
benefits
to
black
men
and
none
to
black
women
In
fact
married
black
women
are
significantly
less
likely
to
report
having
excellent
health
than
are
unmarried
black
women.Actually
there's
no
mystery
why
this
information
wasn't
in
the
executive
summary
It
undermined
this
confident
pre-ordained
conclusion
On
average
married
African
Americans
are
wealthier
happier
and
choose
healthier
behaviors
than
their
unmarried
peers
and
their
children
typically
fare
better
in
life
differences
that
indeed
seem
to
stem
largely
from
marriage
itself
But
there's
an
unusual
tell
in
their
recommendations
Policies
seeking
to
increase
marriage
rates
and
marital
quality
among
African
Americans
should
focus
on
tax
reform
reducing
domestic
violence
providing
culturally-relevant
marital
education
and
counseling
and
numerous
other
efforts
outlined
in
the
report.Tax
reform
first
The
clear
picture
that
emerges
is
that
one
more
funder
for
Prop
Hate
is
actively
involved
in
the
advocacy
of
an
extreme
rightwing
agenda
of
which
the
denial
of
marriage
equality
is
but
one
piece

Holy
Moldy
by
digby
So
Joe
the
sanctimonious
jerk
is
making
his
move
Sen
Joseph
I
Lieberman
one
of
John
McCain's
closest
political
allies
said
Friday
he
does
not
believe
that
Barack
Obama
is
unprepared
to
be
president
I'm
saying
he
is
less
prepared
than
McCain
Lieberman
said
But
what
about
Sarah
Palin
Is
she
ready
If
God
forbid
an
accident
occurs
or
something
of
that
kind
Lieberman
said
Um
she'll
be
ready
You
know
she's
had
executive
experience
She's
smart
and
she
will
have
had
on-the-job
training
McCain
is
ready
to
be
our
president
at
this
very
difficult
time
Lieberman
said
And
Sen
Obama
is
not
as
ready
It's
as
direct
as
that
Hendrick
Hertzberg
says
Not
as
ready
Sweet
That
little
word
as
is
supposed
to
be
Lieberman's
life
jacket
I
guess
now
that
the
SS
McCain
looks
like
it's
going
glug
glug
glug
and
may
not
after
all
be
seaworthy
enough
to
deliver
its
chaplain
to
that
big
corner
office
in
the
Pentagon
Google
lieberman
obama
not
ready
if
you
need
a
few
thousand
samples
of
the
unqualified
way
Joe
talked
about
Barack's
readiness
before
the
ship
hit
the
iceberg
You
probably
don't
need
any
reminding
of
any
more
of
Lieberman's
perfidy
but
Hertzberg
runs
down
some
of
the
highlights
if
you
like
to
torture
yourself
This
reminds
me
of
something
that's
been
driving
me
nuts
for
the
past
few
days
The
gasbags
are
chattering
excitedly
about
the
potential
filibuster-proof
Democratic
senate
majority
On
what
planet
does
anyone
think
that's
actually
going
to
be
operative
It
wouldn't
happen
with
people
like
Ben
Nelson
or
Mary
Landrieu
much
less
Holy
Joe
In
fact
this
fantasy
would
put
Lieberman
right
back
where
he
was
in
the
last
congress
the
deciding
vote
Oy
vey
They'd
be
better
off
just
sticking
with
59
votes
than
let
that
jackass
run
his
game
anymore
Matthews
said
today
that
he
thought
the
governing
party
should
have
a
filibuster
proof
majority
so
he
would
know
who
to
blame
when
nothing
gets
done
Doesn't
that
sound
like
a
perfect
set
up
Either
Reid
and
Obama
will
have
to
whip
up
some
unprecedented
party
loyalty
or
they're
going
to
have
to
educate
the
mainstream
media
about
the
fact
that
having
60
Democrats
in
the
Senate
isn't
a
magic
legislative
bullet
I'm
not
sure
which
one
of
those
things
is
less
likely
to
succeed

Playing
With
Fire
by
digby
I
understand
why
neither
the
authorities
or
the
media
want
to
make
too
big
of
a
deal
about
assassination
plots
against
Obama
by
knuckleheads
Elevating
such
things
to
a
Big
Story
might
just
make
some
people
think
it's
worth
doing
But
sadly
knuckleheads
are
often
the
perpetrators
of
such
crimes
and
the
fact
that
we
have
had
two
plots
that
we
know
of
thwarted
already
makes
me
very
nervous
I
grew
up
in
a
time
when
American
political
leaders
were
assassinated
with
alarming
frequency
It
almost
happened
as
recently
as
1981
although
the
perpetrator
was
a
nutcase
rather
than
a
racist
or
someone
with
a
political
agenda
It's
not
a
relic
of
some
distant
time
in
our
history
And
this
election
is
running
on
some
of
those
very
same
fault
lines
in
American
life
adding
to
the
victimology
of
the
right
wing
and
feeding
into
some
very
ugly
corners
of
the
American
lizard
brain
If
anything
happens
I
will
hold
Republicans
responsible
for
failing
to
call
out
the
disgusting
behavior
of
their
rabid
base
and
very
explicitly
and
frequently
reminding
their
neanderthal
followers
that
political
differences
are
not
a
cause
for
violence
Lying
about
Obama
palling
around
with
terrorists
was
damned
close
to
endorsing
an
assassination
attempt
It's
no
wonder
that
knuckleheads
are
out
there
scheming
Reader
Jake
from
North
Carolina
sent
this
in
to
me
last
night
We
Asheville
are
hosting
Ms
Palin
in
the
arena
this
evening
in
a
big
last-minute
and
hastily
planned
rally
People
have
come
from
all
over
the
southeast
Primarily
the
crowd
is
local
but
there
seems
to
be
a
large
contingent
from
South
Carolina
just
about
an
hour's
drive
from
here
The
crowd
was
estimated
to
be
about
8,000
but
I
can
tell
by
how
long
the
line
is
and
comparing
it
to
concerts
that
have
had
large
turnouts
that
there's
easily
15,000
out
there
The
line
has
gone
around
the
block
completely
and
backed
up
around
back
to
the
front
door
again
You
should
see
this
crowd
These
people
all
look
normal
enough
until
you
really
start
studying
them
Most
are
happy
but
about
every
third
one
is
angry
and
quite
willing
to
scrap
with
the
occasional
protester
that
wonders
by
The
good
news
about
one
of
every
10
is
an
Obama
supporter
I've
spoken
to
a
few
they're
very
sure
they're
going
to
win
That
Palin
is
going
to
be
the
next
VP
and
shortly
the
Pres
Comments
on
our
local
paper's
site
show
that
people
are
taken
with
the
notion
that
Palin
is
just
like
their
neighbors
wife
I
didn't
delve
into
why
they
were
so
sure
that
things
are
going
to
swing
their
way
Maybe
they
believe
that
they've
prayed
about
it
fervently
enough
Maybe
the
fact
that
so
many
are
from
the
reddest
of
red
states
where
red
state
media
only
serves
up
red
meat
to
chew
on
has
skewed
their
world
view
One
can
only
imagine
Maybe
in
their
last
meeting
in
the
great
conspiracy
cornfield
were
they
all
meet
to
breed
they
discussed
the
proper
techniques
for
stealing
votes
Who
knows
It
only
takes
one
of
those
disappointed
true
believers
who
have
been
convinced
that
Obama
is
a
Muslim
socialist
in
league
with
terrorists
to
do
something
stupid
particularly
since
millions
of
them
will
be
convinced
that
ACORN
stole
the
election
for
him
If
you
think
that
all
this
doesn't
tie
into
those
white
supremacist
twits
they
caught
today
think
again
The
right
wing
continues
to
link
the
fight
for
black
equality
with
socialism
and
communism
At
the
website
of
conservatism's
flagship
publication
National
Review
conservatives
like
Andy
McCarthy
argue
whether
Obama
is
more
Maoist
than
Stalinist
and
National
Review
writer
Lisa
Schiffren
explicitly
argued
this
summer
that
Obama
must
have
communist
links
based
on
his
interracial
background
Schiffren
mused
for
a
white
woman
to
marry
a
black
man
in
1958
or
60
there
was
almost
inevitably
a
connection
to
explicit
Communist
politics
This
conclusion
is
one
she
shares
with
Robert
Shelton
Imperial
Wizard
of
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
in
the
1950s
who
declared
that
amalgamation
is
ultimately
the
goal
of
the
Communist
element
To
be
fair
these
conclusions
make
a
bit
of
sense
could
there
be
a
more
perfect
vessel
for
a
secret
communist
takeover
of
the
United
States
than
a
biracial
one-term
senator
from
Chicago
with
an
Arabic-sounding
name
At
a
Starbucks
somewhere
Chairman
Mao
is
leeching
WiFi
for
a
quick
instant
message
to
William
Ayers
It's
happening
exactly
how
we
planned
it
McCain
a
child
of
privilege
who
spent
the
late
1960s
in
a
Vietnamese
prison
camp
may
simply
be
unaware
of
the
feelings
and
historical
context
he
has
evoked
through
his
campaign's
rhetoric
When
Sarah
Palin
accuses
Obama
of
palling
around
with
terrorists
and
suggests
that
Obama
hates
his
own
country
enough
to
wish
it
violence
the
McCain
campaign
fuels
age-old
paranoia
built
around
the
conflation
of
black
rights
and
the
radical
left
As
for
McCain
himself
his
attempts
to
tamp
down
the
vitriol
of
his
crowds
suggest
that
he
is
somewhat
confused
by
their
response
He
wants
voters
to
dislike
Obama
but
he
seems
unaware
of
just
what
he
has
unleashed
However
by
implicitly
invoking
the
idea
that
Obama
represents
a
socialist
takeover
of
the
United
States
McCain
is
inviting
what
can
only
be
a
rational
response
from
those
who
would
die
for
their
country
violence
What
else
is
a
patriot
to
do
when
freedom
is
threatened
Especially
when
their
fears
have
been
validated
by
no
less
authoritative
a
source
than
the
Republican
nominee
for
president
of
the
United
States
Here
are
Rush's
comments
on
today's
nonsense
regarding
Obama's
comments
in
2001
about
the
Supreme
Court
LIMBAUGH
I
just
think
it's
about
the
economy
right
now
You
mentioned
cap
gains
that
may
be
a
little
sophisticated
But
this
Obama
tape
that's
out
there
is
not
It's
not
too
sophisticated
It
is
easily
understood
When
you've
got
a
guy
out
there
saying
that
he
doesn't
believe
in
the
U.S
Constitution
yet
he's
got
to
take
an
oath
to
defend
it
and
protect
it
I
mean
did
Hillary
put
this
out
Where's
this
been
How
come
this
has
not
come
out
until
now
Now
there's
a
lot
of
undecideds
and
that's
where
this
tape
and
that's
where
the
economic
mantle
on
Obama
can
have
some
impact
here
in
the
final
week
Yeah
right
saying
Obama
doesn't
believe
in
the
constitution
is
an
economic
argument
It
plays
directly
into
some
of
the
more
arcane
weirdness
in
the
far
right
about
blacks
and
communism
and
Muslims
forcing
Sharia
law
on
your
virgin
daughters
and
all
sorts
of
wingnut
crazy
that's
only
going
to
get
worse
if
the
Democrats
win
He
knows
exactly
what
kind
of
fear
and
rage
he's
feeding
These
conservatives
are
playing
with
fire
just
like

Traditional
Values
by
digby
For
its
final
op-ed
ad
in
the
New
York
Times
Campaign
For
America's
Future
characterizes
the
progressive
argument
for
change
as
a
return
to
the
Democratic
tradition
I
like
it
a
lot
There's
more
to
the
American
tradition
than
war
and
taxes
For
instance
there
is
the
tradition
of
pulling
together
when
times
are
tough
That's
why
I
think
this
current
Republican
assault
on
the
term
spreading
the
wealth
is
going
to
fall
on
deaf
ears
They
would
have
been
better
sticking
with
the
socialism
boogeyman
since
most
people
don't
really
know
what
it
means
Spreading
the
wealth
just
doesn't
sound
like
a
threatening
unamerican
idea
It
sounds
like
fairness
The
kind
of
thing
you
teach
little
kids
the
kind
of
thing
that
some
people
used
to
call
Christian
values
I
just
don't
think
most
voters
are
going
to
get
too
worked
up
about
whether
the
government
is
being
unfair
to
rich
people
right
now
They
have
plenty
of
other
things
to
worry
about
Obama's
closing
argument
hit
all
those
notes
today
and
I
think
it's
far
more
compelling
than
the
cramped
and
angry
petty
case
from
the
Republicans
A
little
All
American
community
spirit
sounds
very
good
right

Rejecting
The
Footsoldiers
by
digby
Sirota
catches
today's
attempt
to
frame
an
impending
election
of
a
Democratic
government
as
a
victory
for
Republican
philosophy
The
Village
freakout
continues
this
time
in
the
form
of
Peter
Wehner's
op-ed
in
the
Washington
Post
today
With
most
Republican
candidates
explicitly
running
on
a
platform
promising
a
revival
of
Reagan
conservatism
and
berating
the
supposed
socialism
of
Democrats
this
former
Bush
hack
writes
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
assume
that
significant
GOP
losses
should
they
occur
are
a
referendum
on
conservatism
It's
hard
to
overstate
how
absurd
this
is
Let
me
repeat
In
the
stretch
run
of
this
campaign
the
Republican
Party
has
decided
to
make
this
an
ideological
contest
between
Reagan
conservatism
and
supposed
wild-eyed
liberalism/socialism
and
now
sensing
a
potentially
huge
loss
conservatives
are
now
arguing
that
despite
their
decision
to
make
this
an
ideological
contest
an
Obama
victory
would
be
a
partisan
rather
than
an
ideological
win
Obviously
the
Right
understands
what's
really
going
on
in
America
and
is
working
to
reinterpret
that
reality
Having
doubled-down
on
Reaganism
they
know
that
a
loss
under
these
circumstances
would
be
not
just
a
momentary
electoral
set
back
but
a
huge
repudiation
of
conservative
ideology
and
a
huge
mandate
for
progressivism
And
so
conservatives
are
already
trying
to
revise
history
to
pretend
these
last
few
months
of
the
campaign
never
happened
To
underline
Sirota's
point
I
would
just
remind
everyone
of
this
ROMNEY
Absolutely
Ronald
Reagan
would
look
at
the
issues
that
are
being
debated
right
here
and
say
one
we're
going
to
win
in
Iraq
and
I'm
not
going
to
walk
out
of
Iraq
until
we
win
in
Iraq
Ronald
Reagan
would
say
lower
taxes
Ronald
Reagan
would
say
lower
spending
Ronald
Reagan
would
is
pro-life
He
would
also
say
I
want
to
have
an
amendment
to
protect
marriage
Ronald
Reagan
would
say
as
I
do
that
Washington
is
broken
And
like
Ronald
Reagan
I'd
go
to
Washington
as
an
outsider
not
owing
favors
not
lobbyists
on
every
elbow
I
would
be
able
to
be
the
independent
outsider
that
Ronald
Reagan
was
and
he
brought
change
to
Washington
Ronald
Reagan
would
say
yes
let's
drill
in
ANWR
Ronald
Reagan
would
say
no
way
are
we
going
to
have
amnesty
again
Ronald
Reagan
saw
it
it
didn't
work
Let's
not
do
it
again
Ronald
Reagan
would
say
no
to
a
50-cent-per-gallon
charge
on
Americans
for
energy
that
the
rest
of
the
world
doesn't
have
to
pay
Ronald
Reagan
would
have
said
absolutely
no
way
to
McCain
Feingold
I
would
be
with
Ronald
Reagan
And
this
party
it
has
a
choice
what
the
heart
and
soul
of
this
party
is
going
to
be
and
it's
going
to
have
to
be
in
the
house
that
Ronald
Reagan
built
MCCAIN
Ronald
Reagan
would
not
approve
of
someone
who
changes
their
positions
depending
on
what
the
year
is
Ronald
Reagan
Ronald
Reagan
came
with
an
unshakable
set
of
principles
and
there
were
many
times
like
when
he
had
to
deploy
the
INAUDIBLE
cruise
missile
to
Europe
and
there
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
demonstrators
against
it
he
stood
with
it
Ronald
Reagan
had
a
deal
in
Reykjavik
that
everybody
wanted
him
to
take
but
he
stuck
with
his
principles
I
think
he
knows
that
I
stick
with
my
principles
I
put
my
political
career
on
the
line
because
I
knew
what
would
happen
if
we
failed
in
Iraq
I
hope
that
the
experience
I
had
serving
as
a
foot
soldier
in
his
revolution
would
make
him
proud
for
me
to
continue
that
legacy
of
sticking
to
principle
and
doing
what
you
believe
in
no
matter
what
PAUL
I
supported
Ronald
Reagan
in
1976
and
there
were
only
four
members
of
Congress
that
did
And
also
in
1980
Ronald
Reagan
came
and
campaigned
for
me
in
1978
I'm
not
sure
exactly
what
he
would
do
right
now
but
I
do
know
that
he
was
very
sympathetic
to
the
gold
standard
and
he
told
me
personally
that
no
great
nation
that
went
off
the
gold
standard
ever
remained
great
And
he
was
very
very
serious
about
that
So
he
had
a
sound
understanding
about
monetary
policy
And
for
that
reason
I
would
say
look
to
Ronald
Reagan's
ideas
on
money
because
he
too
was
concerned
about
runaway
inflation
and
what
it
does
to
a
country
when
you
ruin
the
currency
And
that's
what's
happening
today
The
dollar
is
going
down
and
our
country
is
going
to
be
on
the
ropes
if
we
don't
reverse
that
trend

Giuliani
said
All
of
the
Republicans
ran
explicitly
as
the
heirs
to
the
legacy
of
Ronald
Reagan
at
times
to
the
point
of
absurdity
The
right
is
working
overtime
to
frame
a
Democratic
win
as
a
repudiation
of
Bushism
which
it
is
But
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
also
a
repudiation
of
Reaganism
They
have
been
evoking
his
name
like
a
sacred
talisman
making
the
case
that
they
would
adhere
to
St
Ronnie's
policies
without
deviation
If
the
Republicans
lose
it's
not
because
the
American
people
want
Reaganism
again
If
that's
what
they
wanted
they
had
a
bunch
of
Republicans
who
said
over
and
over
again
that
they
would
deliver
it
to
them
It's
pretty
clear
the
American
people
are
tired
of
conservatism
whether
it's
Bush
conservatism
or
Reagan
conservatism
and
that
scares
the
villagers
They
are
inherent
conservatives
guardians
of
the
status
quo
and
protectors
of
the
wealthy
elites

as
they
style
themselves
as

The
Final
Days
by
dday
I
fully
expect
one
last-minute
Shocking
revelation
Must
credit
Drudge!!!eleventy!1
for
each
remaining
day
until
the
election
John
McCain
has
run
his
entire
campaign
from
news
cycle
to
news
cycle
and
so
they'll
grasp
on
to
whatever
they
can
manage
to
find
Today's
big
hit
is
a
2001
interview
with
Barack
Obama
about
the
civil
rights
movement
where
he
lamented
the
movement's
propensity
to
lean
on
the
courts
to
mandate
changes
as
opposed
to
building
social
change
from
the
bottom
up
within
local
communities
That's
pretty
much
all
he
said
but
because
he
used
the
words
redistribute
and
wealth
every
conservative
in
America
figures
they've
cracked
the
Da
Vinci
Code
and
revealed
Obama
for
the
Maoist-Leninist-Marxist-Communist-socialist
that
he
is
The
key
quote
is
this
And
I
think
one
of
the
tragedies
of
the
civil
rights
movement
was
that
the
civil
rights
movement
became
so
court-focused
I
think
there
was
a
tendency
to
lose
track
of
the
political
and
organizing
activities
on
the
ground
that
are
able
to
bring
about
the
coalitions
of
power
through
which
you
bring
about
redistributive
change
and
in
some
ways
we
still
suffer
from
that
Obama
said
That's
not
only
a
pretty
conservative
not
in
the
political
sense
argument
it's
echoed
by
conservative
legal
scholars
Now
here's
how
the
McCain
campaign
deliberately
misinterprets
it
Barack
Obama
expressed
his
regret
that
the
Supreme
Court
hadn't
been
more
radical
and
described
as
a
tragedy
the
court's
refusal
to
take
up
the
issues
of
redistribution
of
wealth
No
wonder
he
wants
to
appoint
judges
that
legislate
from
the
bench
Holtz-Eakin
continued
This
is
reminiscent
of
the
global
test
brouhaha
from
2004
where
Bush
officials
went
ahead
and
misinterpreted
a
line
from
John
Kerry
for
their
own
ends
It's
a
very
common
and
even
tired
political
trick
On
the
substance
of
whether
or
not
we
should
accept
redistribution
of
wealth
in
society
perhaps
it's
better
to
flip
the
question
Does
the
McCain-Palin
ticket
defend
the
extreme
concentrations
of
wealth
with
CEOs
earning
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
a
minute
and
sitting
on
the
proceeds
rather
than
creating
jobs
that
exists
in
this
country
today
The
owners
of
the
top
1
of
wealth
have
more
than
the
bottom
90
The
top
1
wage
earners
make
more
than
the
bottom
50
Is
that
in
any
way
sustainable
or
preferable
Can
anyone
look
into
the
eyes
of
the
47
million
who
have
no
health
care
or
the
other
50-60
million
who
would
go
bankrupt
if
they
tried
to
use
theirs
and
tell
them
that
extreme
concentration
of
wealth
is
a
positive
social
good
I
would
put
up
the
time-honored
concept
of
progressive
taxation
against
the
attempt
to
protect
the
massive
depression-inducing
income
inequality
we
have
today
And
furthermore
the
definition
of
socialism
in
general
terms
is
when
the
state
collectivizes
the
ownership
of
the
means
of
production
and
distributes
wealth
equally
across
segments
of
society
You
know
like
in
Alaska
And
Alaska
we're
set
up
unlike
other
states
in
the
union
where
it's
collectively
Alaskans
own
the
resources
So
we
share
in
the
wealth
when
the
development
of
these
resources
occurs
It's
to
maximize
benefits
for
Alaskans
not
an
individual
company
not
some
multinational
somewhere
but
for
Alaskans

Guilty
by

Has
there
ever
been
a
more
perfect
coda
to
the
corrupt
big
money
Republican
rule
than
the
conviction
of
Ted
Stevens
on
all
counts
Alaska
clearly
needs
to
clean
up
its
act
Luckily
the
Democrats
have
a
great
Blue
America
candidate
Mark
Begich
ready
and
willing
to
do
the
clean-up
If
you
would
like
to
help
you
can
do
so
here
keep
in
mind
that
Alaska
is
a
very
red
state
They
have
even
been
known
to
elect
wingnut
Wasilla
mayors
to
the
governorship
rather
than
a
highly
qualified
Democratic
ex-governor
and
mayor
of
Anchorage
So
don't
count
on
Stevens
conviction
not
leading
to
his
reelection
It
could
happen
Obviously
he
wouldn't

reported
that

heroic

not
to
use
Jeremiah

in
the
election
because
John
Lewis
had
said
he
was
hearing
some

sadly
Mccain

not
be

It

of
those
527s
is
coming
to
the
rescue
saving
poor
McCain
from
having
to
further
besmirch
his
sterling
character
The

which
aired
one
harsh

that
it
also

to
fundraise
on
Drudge

elsewhere
says
it's
putting
2.5

this
spot
in
Ohio
Pennsylvania

ad
is
exactly

many
conservatives
have
been
hoping
would
air

a
voice-over
describing

For
20
years
Obama
never
complained
until
he
ran
for
president
says
the
ad
which
labels
Obama
too
radical
too
risky
This

That

the
base
giving

Palin
by

She
is
way
off

Ensuring
that
news
of
the
Republican
National
Committee's
sartorial
spending
spree
will
remain
in
the
headlines
for
at
least
one
more
news
cycle
Sarah
Palin
on
Sunday
sounded
off
on
the
150,000
wardrobe
that
was
purchased
for
her
in
September
denouncing
the
report
as
ridiculous
and
declaring
emphatically
Those
clothes
they
are
not
my
property
A
senior
adviser
to
John
McCain
told
CNN's
Dana
Bash
that
the
comments
about
her
wardrobe
were
not
the
remarks
we
sent
to
her
plane
this
morning
Palin
did
not
discuss
the
wardrobe
story
at
her
rally
in
Kissimmee
later
in
the
day
At
this
point
the
McCain
campaign
consultants
are
trying
to
keep
from
being
sued
for
political
malpractice
After
Palin
made
the
kind
of
mistake
she
made
yesterday
by
keeping
that
story
alive
they
have
to
cover
their
asses
I
saw
it
as
it
happened
and
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
But
in
Tampa
Palin
happily
broached
the
clothing
issue
after
being
introduced
by
The
View
co-host
Elisabeth
Hasselbeck
who
accused
Palin's
opponents
of
being
fixated
on
her
wardrobe
and
deliberately
sexist
That
opened
the
door
for
Palin
to
weigh
in
on
a
topic
that
has
frustrated
the
candidate
and
her
advisers
since
the
story
first
broke
five
days
ago
This
whole
thing
with
the
wardrobe
you
know
I
have
tried
to
just
ignore
it
because
it
is
so
ridiculous
but
I
am
glad
now
that
Elisabeth
brought
it
up
cause
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
without
the
filter
of
the
media
to
get
to
tell
you
the
whole
clothes
thing
she
said
Those
clothes
they
are
not
my
property
Just
like
the
lighting
and
the
staging
and
everything
else
that
the
RNC
purchased
I'm
not
taking
them
with
me
I
am
back
to
wearing
my
own
clothes
from
my
favorite
consignment
shop
in
Anchorage
Alaska
You'd
think
not
that
I
would
even
have
to
address
the
issue
because
as
Elisabeth
is
suggesting
the
double
standard
here
it's
gosh
we
don't
even
want
to
waste
our
time
Palin
however
forged
on
I
am
glad
though
that
she
brought
up
accessories
also
Let
me
tell
you
a
little
bit
about
a
couple
of
accessories
didn't
think
that
we
would
be
talking
about
it
but
my
earrings
I
see
a
Native

These

A

that
I
bought
myself
and
cause
I
always
thought
with
my
ring
it's
not

20

After
spending
four
minutes
on
the
shopping
escapade
Palin
switched
gears
and
trained
her
sights
on
Barack
Obama
who
she
said
is
prematurely
measuring
the
White
House
drapes
Barack
Obama
and
I
we
both
have

quite
some

court
she
said
But
where
I
come
from
you
have
to
win
the
game
before
you
start
cutting
down
the
nets
Palin
accused
the
Democrat
of
renting
a
stadium
for
a
victory
party
on
November
4
That's
actually
not
the
case
Obama's
rally
on

will
be
held
outdoors
in
Grant
Park
in

Chicago
She's
just
letting
it
all
hang
out
now
And
on
a
slightly
amusing
sidenote
Palin
told
the
press
last
Friday
that
she
was
very
frugal
and
shopped
at
a
store
called
Out
of
the
Closet
in
Anchorage
Anyone
who
lives
in
LA
must
have
chuckled
at
that
one
because
Out
of
the
Closet
is
a
major
thrift
store
chain
that
benefits
HIVAids
patients
I
thought
that
it
might
have
even
been
the
same
chain
It's
not
the

of

Sarah

thrift

Pharmacy

which
is
open
to
everyone
but
offers

specific

in
HIV/AIDS

Governor
Sarah
Palin
recently
made
headlines
stating
that
another
Out
of
the
Closet
resale
store
in
Alaska
is
her
family's
favorite
store
AHF
will
pursue
trademark
protection
for
its
registered
federal
trademark
for
Out
of

Closet
which
AHF
first
opened
in
1990
And
then
there's

at

the

I
was

that
Alaska's
been

a

and
they
said
that

shops
at
their

all
the

he
said
The

up

the

Can

In

call
with

on
Friday
Lieberman
bristled
at
the

coverage
of
the

campaign's
negativity
You
guys
are
going
down
a
road
you
have
contributed
to
the
demeaning
of

by
this
kind
of
focus
Lieberman
said
I

give
me
a
break
Have
any
of
you
been
out
listening
to
me
When
I
go
out
I

I
have
a

of
respect
for

He's
bright
He's

Someday
I
might
even
support
him
for

Lieberman
told
a
conference
call
of
Connecticut
reporters
But
now
in
the
midst
of
this
series
of
crises
John
McCain
is
simply
so
much
better
prepared
that
that's
who
I
am
proud
to
support
Lieberman
also
said
that
if
McCain
doesn't
I'm
going
to
do
everything
I
can
to
be
bringing
people
together
across
party
lines
to
support
the
new
president
so
he
can
succeed
Actually
sure
I
can
Lieberman
is
a
suck-up
to
power
as
much
as
the
rest
of
them
But
the
revisionism
a
week
before
the
election
is
a
little
too
much
to
take
He
has
spent
the
entire
election
questioning
Obama's
patriotism
and
pushing
the
basest
smears
and
lies
The
chairmanship
that
Lieberman
now
holds
has
the
authority
to
conduct
oversight
on
the
federal
government
There
is
absolutely
no
reason
to
believe
that
Lieberman
wouldn't
abuse
that
power
in
the
event
of
an
Obama
Administration
Regardless
of
the
number
of
Democrats
in
the
Senate
there
is
no
way
that
Lieberman
should
be
allowed
to
maintain
that
chairmanship
His
choice
of
caucus
partners
is
his
decision
But
his
seniority
should
be
gone

know
where
would
you
have
U.S

replied

I'm
not
going

go
there
and
here's
why
because
Pakistan
is

U.S

Sunday

territory
close

killing

the

the

by

targeted
the

The
Americans
have
been

And
it's
all
Sarah
W
Palin
and
John
McCain's
fault
Here's
Peggy
Noonan
In
the
end
the
Palin
candidacy
is
a
symptom
and
expression
of
a
new
vulgarization
in
American
politics
It's
no
good
not
for
conservatism
and
not
for
the
country
And
yes
it
is
a
mark
against
John
McCain
against
his
judgment
and
idealism.Noonan
has
been
fluttering
about
rudeness
for
some
time
now
You'll
recall
that
she
famously
blamed
liberals
for
all
this
because
they
booed
Trent
Lott
at
a
memorial
rally
for
Paul
Wellstone
Who
could
forget
her
having
the
unadulterated
cojones
to
pretend
to
speak
for
the
great
liberal
in
heaven
as
he
lectured
Democrats
on
their
vulgar
behavior
You
hurt
a
lot
of
people
You
didn't
mean
to
you
meant
to
be
Happy
Warriors
But
you
offended
and
hurt
and
antagonized
more
than
half
the
country
And
you
have
to
think
about
why
Here
I
think
is
the
reason
a
dulling
of
the
senses
a
kind
of
despair
that
has
led
you
to
let
politics
completely
take
over
your
lives
That's
the
reason
you
treated
a
reflective
and
loving
occasion
as
well
as
a
big
vulgar
whomp-'em-stomp-'em
rally
with
jeers
and
cheers
and
my
casket
as
the
stump
from
which
you
lambasted
the
foe
This
is
what
I
feel
you
have
to
think
about
You
can
make
your
life
sick
and
small
you
can
fill
it
with
poison
when
you
turn
everything
into
politics
And
what
makes
me
sad
is
not
that
you
used
my
death
to
get
out
the
vote
It's
not
that
you
were
cold
It's
that
the
only
way
you
could
show
any
warmth
was
through
politics
That
memorial
was
the
triumph
of
politics
at
the
expense
of
the
personal
At
the
expense
of
what
makes
you
human
See
liberals
were
inhuman
for
booing
Trent
Lott
even
as
he
laughed
it
off
and
carried
on
without
even
blinking
This
behavior
was
at
the
time
sold
as
the
most
despicable
disgusting
form
of
indecent
public
behavior
since
the
drawing
and
quartering
of
William
Wallace
And
it
was
you'll
also
recall
in
the
final
weeks
of
a
hard
fought
mid-term
election
where
the
Republicans
were
comparing
war
heroes
to
Saddam
Hussein
and
the
majority
leader
to
Osama
bin
laden
No
matter
the
liberals
were
vulgar
and
wanted
to
win
too
much
for
booing
Trent
Lott
Peggy
spent
the
next
few
years
casually
smearing
Democrats
and
liberals
in
her
patented
unctuous
prose
The
Democratic
nominee
in
2004
could
win
the
election
There
may
be
something
to
the
idea
that
Democrats
in
general
want
to
get
rid
of
George
W
Bush
more
than
Republicans
in
general
want
to
keep
him
One
of
the
men
running
in
New
Hampshire
tonight
could
become
the
next
president
and
lead
the
war
on
terror
And
our
country
cannot
afford
a
bit
of
a
nut
Which
get
us
of
course
to
Howard
Dean
But
not
for
long
I
do
not
know
how
Democrats
in
New
Hampshire
will
judge
him
today
but
I
can
say
with
confidence
that
the
American
people
will
not
choose
him
as
president
because
they
will
not
want
him
near
the
nuclear
arsenal
Which
gets
me
to
Wesley
Clark
Forgive
me
but
he
seems
to
be
another
first
class
strange-o
Then
liberals
were
in
love
with
death
and
were
leading
the
country
on
a
low
road
that
ends
up
in
Auschwitz
Terri
Schiavo
may
well
die
No
good
will
come
of
it
Those
who
are
half
in
love
with
death
will
only
become
more
red-fanged
and
ravenous
And
those
who
are
still
learning--our
children--oh
what
terrible
lessons
they're
learning
What
terrible
stories
are
shaping
them
They're
witnessing
the
Schiavo
drama
on
television
and
hearing
it
on
radio
They
are
seeing
a
society--their
society
their
people--on
the
verge
of
famously
accepting
even
embracing
the
idea
that
a
damaged
life
is
a
throwaway
life
Our
children
have
been
reared
in
the
age
of
abortion
and
are
coming
of
age
in
a
time
when
seemingly
respectable
people
are
enthusiastic
for
euthanasia
It
cannot
be
good
for
our
children
and
the
world
they
will
make
that
they
are
given
this
new
lesson
that
human
life
is
not
precious
not
touched
by
the
divine
not
of
infinite
value
Once
you
know
that--that
human
life
is
not
so
special
after
all--then
everything
is
possible
and
none
of
it
is
good
When
a
society
comes
to
believe
that
human
life
is
not
inherently
worth
living
it
is
a
slippery
slope
to
the
gas
chamber
You
wind
up
on
a
low
road
that
twists
past
Columbine
and
leads
toward
Auschwitz
Today
that
road
runs
through
Pinellas
Park
Fla
Nothing
vulgar
about
that
Recently
we
had
Noonan
wincing
when
her
good
friend
Ann
Coulter
called
John
Edwards
a
faggot
to
lusty
applause
Our
country
now
puts
less
of
an
emphasis
on
public
decorum
courtliness
self-discipline
decency
America
no
longer
says
That's
not
nice
It
doesn't
want
to
make
value
judgments
on
good
and
bad
We
have
come
to
rely
on
censorship
to
maintain
decorum
We
are
very
good
at
letting
people
know
that
if
they
say
something
we
don't
like
we'll
shame
them
and
shun
them
even
ruin
them
But
censorship
doesn't
make
people
improve
themselves
it
makes
people
want
to
rebel
It
tells
them
to
toe
the
line
or
pay
a
price
People
who
are
urged
in
the
right
direction
and
taught
in
the
right
direction
will
usually
try
to
discipline
and
improve
themselves
from
within
But
they
do
not
enjoy
censorship
from
without
They
fight
back
They
are
rude
in
order
to
show
they
are
unbroken
This
is
human
And
Grandma
would
have
understood
this
too
I
think
the
atmosphere
of
political
correctness
is
now
experienced
by
normal
people
not
people
who
speak
on
TV
but
normal
people
as
so
oppressive
so
demanding
of
constant
self-policing
that
when
someone
says
something
in
public
that
is
truly
not
nice
not
nice
at
all
they
can't
help
but
feel
that
they
are
witnessing
a
prison
break
As
long
as
political
correctness
reigns
the
more
antic
among
us
will
try
to
break
out
with
great
streams
of
Tourette's-like
forbidden
words
and
ideas
We
should
forbid
less
and
demand
more
We
should
exert
less
pressure
from
without
and
encourage
more
discipline
from
within
We
should
ask
people
to
be
dignified
hope
they'll
be
generous
expect
them
to
be
fair
When
they're
not
we
should
correct
them
But
we
shouldn't
beat
them
to
a
pulp
Because
that's
not
nice
And
then
there
was
this
Good
old
Peggy
creating
the
very
meme
she
now
denounces
as
vulgar
His
problem
was
is
his
wife's
words
not
his
the
speech
in
which
she
said
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
adult
life
she
is
proud
of
her
country
because
Obama
is
winning
She
later
repeated
it
then
tried
to
explain
it
saying
of
course
she
loves
her
country
But
damage
was
done
Why
Because
her
statement
focused
attention
on
what
I
suspect
are
some
basic
and
elementary
questions
that
were
starting
to
bubble
out
there
anyway
Are
the
Obamas
at
bottom
snobs
Do
they
understand
America
Are
they
of
it
Did
anyone
at
their
Ivy
League
universities
school
them
in
why
one
should
love
America
Do
they
confuse
patriotism
with
nationalism
or
nativism
Are
they
more
inspired
by
abstractions
like
international
justice
than
by
old
visions
of
America
as
the
city
on
a
hill
which
is
how
John
Winthrop
saw
it
and
Ronald
Reagan
and
JFK
spoke
of
it
Have
they
been
throughout
their
adulthood
so
pampered
and
praised--so
raised
in
the
liberal
cocoon--that
they
are
essentially
unaware
of
what
and
how
normal
Americans
think
And
are
they
in
this
like
those
cosseted
yuppies
the
Clintons
Why
is
all
this
actually
not
a
distraction
but
a
real
issue
Because
Americans
have
common
sense
and
are
bottom
line
They
think
like
this
If
the
president
and
his
first
lady
are
not
loyal
first
to
America
and
its
interests
who
will
be
The
president
of
France
But
it's
his
job
to
love
France
and
protect
its
interests
If
America's
leaders
don't
love
America
tenderly
who
will
And
there
is
a
context
So
many
Americans
right
now
fear
they
are
losing
their
country
that
the
old
America
is
slipping
away
and
being
replaced
by
something
worse
something
formless
and
hollowed
out
They
can
see
we
are
giving
up
our
sovereignty
that
our
leaders
will
not
control
our
borders
that
we
don't
teach
the
young
the
old-fashioned
love
of
America
that
the
government
has
taken
to
itself
such
power
and
made
things
so
complex
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
they
count
up
sales
tax
property
tax
state
tax
federal
tax
they
are
paying
a
lot
of
money
to
lose
the
place
they
loved
And
if
you
feel
you're
losing
America
you
really
don't
want
a
couple
in
the
White
House
whose
rope
of
affection
to
the
country
seems
lightly
held
casual
provisional
America
is
backing
Barack
at
the
moment
so
America
is
good
When
it
becomes
angry
with
President
Barack
will
that
mean
America
is
bad
What
a
nice
way
of
saying
that
Obama
isn't
a
real
American
Good
thing
it
isn't
vulgar
Noonan
writes
in
elegant
prose
but
the
meaning
of
her
words
are
no
different
than
what
Sarah
palin
and
the
crazies
at
the
McCain-Palin
rallies
are
spewing
She's
spent
the
last
couple
of
decades
helping
to
create
this
vulgar
political
world
and
now
she's
trying
to
separate
herself
from
what
she's
done
And
that's
yet
another
way
in
which
she's
just
a
typical
conservative
like
Sarah
Palin
and
Rush
Limbaugh
when
her
vulgar
politics
catch
up
with
her
instead
of
standing
tall
and
taking
responsibility
she
pretends
that
she
was
somewhere
else
I
hope
that
people
don't
get
so
caught
up
with
these
late
breaking
conversions
to
the
one
true
faith
that
they
forget
that
these
people
are
not
heretics
or
apostates
They
are
opportunistic
cowards
pure
and
simple
rats
deserting
a
sinking
ship
and
they
will
never
ever
change

I've
been
writing
for
a
very
long
time
that
the
minute
a
Democratic
president
is
sworn
in
the
Village
cries
for
bipartisanship
are
going
to
be
deafening
They
did
it
after
2006
imagine
what
they'll
do
now
Just
last
week
Broder
laid
down
the
gauntlet
Now
Obama
fan
and
former
Bush
sycophant
Howard
Fineman
is
starting
to
get
nervous
This
is
the
engine
room
of
a
novel
grass-roots
machine
that
may
soon
have
another
purpose
to
help
Obama
govern
the
country
If
he
wins
it
also
could
cause
him
headaches...'His
supporters
have
sky-high
expectations
and
expect
to
be
involved
says
Will
Marshall
who
studied
the
Obama
organization
for
the
Democratic
Leadership
Council
They
are
loyal
but
not
easy
to
control
It
could
also
cause
Obama
problems
Much
of
America
may
be
gung-ho
about
putting
more
troops
into
Afghanistan
but
it's
not
clear
Obamaworld
is
he
could
run
into
opposition
if
he
seriously
pursues
it
On
the
other
hand
initiating
talks
with
Iranian
and
Venezuelan
dictators
enjoys
more
support
on
his
e-mail
lists
than
in
the
rest
of
the
country
If
the
Democrats
win
bigger
majorities
in
the
House
and
Senate
they
if
not
Obama
may
well
be
eager
to
exact
vengeance
on
Republicans
or
at
least
cram
Democratic
ideas
down
GOP
throats
Obama
supporters
might
prefer
more
reaching-out
As
Marshall
sees
it
most
of
them
want
a
transpartisan
approach
that
jettisons
the
old
labels
These
people
feel
a
close
personal
tie
to
Obama
just
as
conservatives
did
to
Reagan
he
says
But
if
and
when
he
starts
governing
he
is
going
to
start
disappointing
them
He
sounds
awfully
sure
of
himself
Here's
David
Sirota
correctly
assessing
the
real
meaning
of
all
this
To
the
Village
it
would
be
horrible
catastrophic
even
if
Obama
supporters
dared
to
expect
Obama
to
actually
pursue
a
true
progressive
agenda
Obama
supporters
are
therefore
depicted
as
a
wild-eyed
bewildered
herd
of
lunatic
leftists
that
as
the
corporate-backed
DLC
says
are
gasp
not
easy
to
control
This
is
a
portrayal
designed
to
press
Obama
to
immediately
shun
his
base
capitulate
to
conservatives
in
the
spirit
of
transpartisanship
reject
cramming
Democratic
ideas
down
GOP
throats
even
though
Obama
campaigned
on
Democratic
ideas
and
bow
down
to
the
Serious
and
Respected
Villagers
after
the
election
Of
course
these
are
the
same
Villagers
whose
neoconservatism
got
us
into
Iraq
and
whose
free-market
fundamentalism
drove
the
country
to
the
bring
of
economic
disaster
all
under
the
guise
of
transpartisanship
Now
these
same
Villagers
are
making
it
clear
that
the
Serious
and
Responsible
thing
for
Obama
to
do
is
deliberately
disappoint
the
people
who
elected
him
Indeed
disappointing
the
people
who
elected
him
is
the
only
way
that
he
can
be
taken
seriously
It's
a
right
of
passage
for
Democrats
and
if
he
doesn't
do
it
himself
they'll
bring
in
some
elders
to
push
hard
in
the
press
Here's
where
our
new
best
friends
like
Colin
Powell
will
come
in
handy
for
the
villagers
He
may
have
been
a
good
soldier
for
Bush
but
his
history
is
one
of
stabbing
Democrats
in
the
back
Predictably
establishment
Dems
are
helping
them
Democrats
said
they
were
well
aware
of
the
mistakes
of
the
past
and
the
overconfidence
exhibited
during
one-party
rule
of
the
Clinton
and
Bush
administrations
that
led
to
Democrats
losing
control
of
the
House
in
1994
and
to
Republicans
experiencing
a
similar
defeat
in
2006
Chastened
by
their
years
in
exile
Democrats
said
they
were
determined
to
avoid
those
pitfalls
should
voters
deliver
them
control
of
the
White
House
and
Congress
The
nature
of
the
Democratic
majority
expanded
partly
through
the
election
of
centrists
and
even
conservatives
would
also
temper
Democratic
zeal
to
pursue
an
overly
ideological
agenda
Democrats
said
We
are
going
to
get
new
members
with
a
clear
understanding
that
the
reason
they
won
is
appealing
to
independents
and
disaffected
Republicans
and
they
are
going
to
want
to
continue
to
do
that
said
the
House
majority
leader
Representative
Steny
H
Hoyer
Democrat
of
Maryland
Good
to
know
we
won't
have
to
deal
with
any
crazy
stunts
like
universal
health
care
withdrawal
from
Iraq
or
badly
needed
economic
investment
to
counter
the
recession
and
the
banking
crisis
Steny's
going
to
save
us
from
all
that
left-wing
nuttiness
Tax
cuts
that's
the
ticket
More
tax
cuts
More
war
The
Republicans
who
ruled
like
a
marauding
horde
of
Vikings
agree
with
Steny
that
Real
Americans
want
them
to
govern
us
from
the
opposition
I
think
the
Senate
operates
best
when
it
makes
things
happen
in
the
middle
and
that
happens
when
you
have
41
or
more
people
who
resist
an
idea
to
the
point
where
you
can
compromise
said
Senator
Mitch
McConnell
of
Kentucky
the
Republican
leader
and
a
lawmaker
whose
own
seat
is
at
risk
I
think
there
will
be
enough
Republicans
plus
discerning
Democrats
in
the
Senate
after
January
to
keep
a
kind
of
far-left
agenda
from
steamrolling
through
the
Senate
like
it
often
does
through
the
House
Oh
Thank
God
The
Republicans
will
almost
certainly
have
enough
discerning
Democrats
to
continue
to
run
the
country
as
effectively
as
they
have
the
last
eight
years
Whew
I
don't
know
where
Obama
stands
in
all
of
this
but
I
assume
he
knows
that
the
success
of
his
presidency
rests
on
his
ability
to
relieve
this
free
floating
anxiety
out
in
the
land
about
America's
future
More
people
than
ever
before
think
America's
best
days
are
behind
it
and
that
something
has
gone
terribly
terribly
wrong
And
they
are
not
just
whining
The
nation
is
facing
some
very
very
serious
challenges
that
require
bold
action
the
economy
is
in
serious
trouble
we
are
dealing
with
an
energy
crisis
so
acute
that
we
are
fighting
wars
over
it
and
the
planet
it
in
grave
near
term
danger
from
global
warming
Oh
and
there
are
a
bunch
of
religious
fundamentalist
terrorists
still
running
around
and
Americans
can't
afford
to
get
sick
anymore
without
losing
everything
Worrying
about
whether
or
not
David
Broder
and
Howard
Fineman
think
it's
serious
to
take
these
things
seriously
is
a
recipe
for
failure
Let's
hope
Obama
can
either
finesse
them
or
ignore
them
In
the
meantime
it's
incumbent
upon
all
of
us
latte
sipping
freaks
to
make
sure
that
the
Democrats
know
who
brung
them
One
way
to
do
that
is
to
vote
in
some
real
progressives
to
balance
out
the
Discerning
Democrats
who
are
really
Republicans
in
sheep's
clothing
Blue
America
is
backing
a
whole
slate
of
them
If
you
live
in
or
near
on
of
their
districts
volunteer
to
help
in
this
last
week
Some
of
these
races
are

very
close

you

Two
Really
Bad
Ideas
From
The
Department
Of
Really
Bad
Ideas
by
tristero
From
the
International
Division
of
the
Department
Of
Really
Bad
Ideas
Civil
rights
campaigners
are
angry
that
ministers
have
approved
plans
to
allow
Sharia
councils
in
Britain
the
right
to
settle
disputes
regarding
money
property
and
access
to
children
They
say
such
tribunals
are
institutions
for
male
domination
which
treat
women
like
second-class
citizens
Couples
who
choose
to
use
the
Sharia
system
must
get
the
ruling
rubber-stamped
by
a
judge
sitting
in
an
ordinary
family
court
But
neither
party
has
to
attend
this
hearing
and
approval
can
be
obtained
by
filling
in
a
two-page
application
The
endorsement
of
Sharia
was
announced
to
MPs
by
Bridget
Prentice
a
junior
minister
in
answer
to
a
parliamentary
question
She
said
Sharia
councils
would
still
have
no
jurisdiction
in
England
and
rulings
by
religious
authorities
would
have
no
legal
force
But
she
added
If
in
a
family
dispute
dealing
with
money
or
children
the
parties
to
a
judgement
in
Sharia
council
wish
to
have
this
recognised
by
English
authorities
they
are
at
liberty
to
draft
a
consent
order
embodying
the
terms
of
the
agreement
and
submit
it
to
an
English
court
This
allows
English
judges
to
scrutinise
it
to
ensure
that
it
complies
with
English
legal
tenets
Campaigners
condemned
the
plans
as
unacceptable
and
said
that
the
rulings
were
not
compatible
with
English
law
while
the
Conservatives
insisted
that
should
be
safeguards
for
women
Nick
Herbert
the
shadow
justice
secretary
said
There
can
be
no
place
for
parallel
legal
systems
in
our
country.One
would
hope
so
From
The
American
division
What
is
known
however
is
that
Ms
Palin
has
had
long
associations
with
religious
leaders
who
practice
a
particularly
assertive
and
urgent
brand
of
Pentecostalism
known
as
spiritual
warfare
Its
adherents
believe
that
demonic
forces
can
colonize
specific
geographic
areas
and
individuals
and
that
spiritual
warriors
must
battle
them
to
assert
God's
control
using
prayer
and
evangelism
The
movement's
fixation
on
demons
its
aggressiveness
and
its
leaders
claims
to
exalted
spiritual
authority
have
troubled
even
some
Pentecostal
Christians
Ms
Palin
delivered
an
enthusiastic
graduation
speech
for
a
class
of
young
spiritual
warriors
in
June
at
the
Wasilla
Assembly
of
God
the
church
in
which
she
was
raised
As
governor
Ms
Palin
appointed
Patrick
Donelson
a
pastor
and
fishing
guide
who
helped
found
a
spiritual
warfare
ministry
to
the
only
seat
reserved
for
members
of
the
clergy
on
the
state's
Suicide
Prevention
Council
Bishop
Thomas
Muthee
the
Kenyan
preacher
shown
on
the
YouTube
video
anointing
her
as
she
ran
for
governor
is
celebrated
internationally
as
an
effective
spiritual
warrior
who
led
a
prayer
movement
that
drove
a
witch
out
of
his
town
in
Kenya
The
removal
of
the
witch
Bishop
Muthee
says
resulted
in
a
drop
in
crime
alcoholism
and
traffic
accidents
Religious
leaders
in
Alaska
including
Mr
Donelson
declined
interviews
with
several
saying
they
had
been
told
by
the
McCain-Palin
campaign
not
to
talk
to
members
of
the
news
media
Russell
P
Spittler
provost
emeritus
at
Fuller
Theological
Seminary
in
Pasadena
Calif
and
an
eminent
scholar
of
Pentecostalism
said
Most
Christians
would
accept
the
view
that
there
are
forces
and
powers
in
the
world
that
oppose
Christian
virtues
But
Mr
Spittler
added
Spiritual
warfare
makes
a
religion
of
identifying
demons
by
names
and
ZIP
codes
Y'mean
like
Beelzebub
07078
Critics
say
the
goal
of
the
spiritual
warfare
movement
is
to
create
a
theocracy
Bruce
Wilson
a
researcher
for
Talk2Action
a
Web
site
that
tracks
religious
groups
said
One
of
the
imperatives
of
the
movement
is
to
achieve
worldly
power
including
political
control
Then
you
can
more
effectively
drive
out
the
demons
The
ultimate
goal
is
to
purify
the
earth
The
article
does
assure
us
that
it

scarier

it
is

the
brouhaha

Terri
Schiavo

Pennsylvania
by

Now
I'm
going
to
have
to
call
all
my
relatives
Thanks
a
lot
McCain
campaign
Pennsylvania
will
see
a
lot
of
Sen
John
McCain
and
Gov
Sarah
Palin
next
week
The
scheduling
reflects
McCain's
tough
electoral
math
With
some
though
by
no
means
all
advisers
all
but
conceding
Colorado
McCain
would
be
forced
to
win
a
blue
state
in
order
to
recoup
the
electoral
votes
New
Hampshire
wouldn't
give
him
enough
and
Pennsylvania
the
McCain
campaign
believes
is
the
most
brittle
of
the
remaining
states
Public
and
private
polls
give
Obama
a
double
digit
lead
in
the
state
but
McCain
advisers
believe
that
Obama
is
underperforming
in
the
suburbs
and
exurban
counties
around
Pittsburgh
Tensions
between
the
two
campaigns
in
the
state
is
acute
Pennsylvania
doesn't
have
early
voting
meaning
that
the
McCain
campaign
is
not
starting
from
a
deficit
like
in
other
states
and
it's
82
white
a
fairly
high
percentage
as
well
as
one
of
the
older
states
in
the
union
15%-plus
over
65
And
so
the
dirtiest
of
dirty
tricks
are
all
manifesting
themselves

Jewish
Americans
cannot

to
make
the

the
e-mail
reads
Many
of

ignored
the
warning

in

1930s
and
1940s
and
made
a
tragic
mistake
Let's
not
make
a
similar
one
this
year

and

Republican

John
McCain's

over

The

distancing
himself
from

mailer
is
the
one
who
was
feeding

mugging
And
then
from
the
furthest
stretches
of
Outer
Wingnuttia
there's
this
A
federal
judge
in
Philadelphia
last
night
threw
out
a
complaint
by
a
Montgomery
County
lawyer
who
claimed
that
Democratic
presidential
candidate
Barack
Obama
was
not
qualified
to
be
president
and
that
his
name
should
be
removed
from
the
Nov
4
ballot
Philip
J
Berg
alleged
in
a
complaint
filed
in
federal
district
court
on
Aug
21
against
Obama
the
Democratic
National
Committee
and
the
Federal
Election
Commission
that
Obama
was
born
in
Mombasa
Kenya
Berg
claimed
that
the
Democratic
presidential
standardbearer
is
not
even
an
American
citizen
but
a
citizen
of
Indonesia
and
therefore
ineligible
to
be
president
He
alleged
that
if
Obama
was
permitted
to
run
for
president
and
subsequently
found
to

attempts

use

to

to

were
frivolous

Divas
On
Parade
by
digby
I'm
sure
you
have
all
heard
by
now
that
McCain
loyalists
are
already
out
there
dissing
Palin
for
ruining
everything
But
this
one
made
me
chuckle
a
bit
A
second
McCain
source
says
she
appears
to
be
looking
out
for
herself
more
than
the
McCain
campaign
She
is
a
diva
She
takes
no
advice
from
anyone
said
this
McCain
adviser
She
does
not
have
any
relationships
of
trust
with
any
of
us
her
family
or
anyone
else
Also
she
is
playing
for
her
own
future
and
sees
herself
as
the
next
leader
of
the
party
Remember
Divas
trust
only
unto
themselves
as
they
see
themselves
as
the
beginning
and
end
of
all
wisdom
My
goodness,somebody
is
just
all
upset
Get
that
diva
a
chill
pill
Palin
shouldn't
feel
too
upset
by
this
In
fact
it
should
but
won't
make
her
a
little
bit
less
critical
of
Obama
who
the
McCain
campaign
spent
the
summer
belittling
as
a
celebrity
She
should
be
glad
they
didn't
call
her
what
McCain
calls
his
wife
perhaps
that
will
have
to
wait
until
after
the
election
Meanwhile
I'm
hard
pressed
to
hold
Palin
completely
responsible
for
this
Her
lack
of
fundamental
understanding
of
some
key
issues
was
dramatic
said
another
McCain
source
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
process
to
prepare
Palin
after
she
was
picked
The
source
said
it
was
probably
the
hardest
to
get
her
up
to
speed
than
any
candidate
in
history
I
discussed
this
earlier
They
didn't
even
ask
if
she
knew
anything
They
chose
her
because
she
spoke
to
Charlie
Rose
like
and
automaton
and
because
she
looked
good
They
have
only
themselves
to
blame
if
she
was
completely
unschooled
on
issues
and
political
politesse
She
delivered
everything
they
were
asking
for
On
the
other
hand
it
does
take
a
real
diva
to
accept
a
job
for
which
you
are
completely
unqualified
and
then
blame
the
people
who
chose
you
for
failing
to
properly
prepare
you
for
the
job
I
know
it's
anti-American
to
turn
down
a
big
opportunity
but
the
stakes
were
damned
high
and
she
could
have
done
it
Lot's
of
people
do
In
fact
on
the
Republican
side
there
was
a
long
line
of
them

Slight
return
By
Dennis

At
the
risk
of
instigating
a
public
stoning
I
thought
I
would
take
a
bit
of
a
departure
this
week
and
switch
over
to
the
gulp
small
screen
So
if
you're
a
TV
snob
you
might
want
to
tune
out
now
and
spare
us
the
eye-rolling
and
the
predictable

don't
you

those
still

in
no

order
that
I
currently
find
to
be
compelling
enough
to
earn
the

nod
on
my

shared
a
similar

Sure
some
of
the

are
admittedly
silly
and
things
do
tend
to
get
a
bit
too
precious
at
times
especially
when
characters
go
smashing
through
the
Fourth

like
bulls
in
the
proverbial
china
shop
but
there
is
one
thing
I'm
going
to
miss
more
than
anything
else
and
that's
Alan
Shore's
closing
arguments
Well
for
the
sake
of
the
narrative
they
are
called
closing
arguments
but
I
think
we
all
know
they
are
in

some
of
the
most
incisive
intelligently
written

I
will
admit
upfront
that
I
missed
this
one
during
its
initial
run
back
in
January
of
this
year
I
don't
think
it
initially
got
a
lot
of
press
or
much
viewer
buzz
but
like
many
people
my
interest
was
piqued
when
Bryan
Cranston
picked
up
an
Emmy
for
his
starring
role

been
replaying
the

I'm
hooked
Cranston
gives
a
full-blooded
performance
as
Walter
White

middle-aged
chemistry
teacher
who
is
diagnosed
with
late-stage
lung
cancer

with
a
desperate
sense
of
urgency

build
up
a
nest
egg
for
his
pregnant
wife
and
cerebral
palsy-afflicted
son
he
partners
up
with
a
former

applies
his
knowledge
of

to
cook
up
some
award-winning

a
brother-in-law
in

complicates
his

might
expect
Yes
it
is
reminiscent

it's

investigates
a
prehistoric

some
epic
clash

has
ensued

unfolds
through

with

HBO's

an
animated

comedy
that
is
sort

a
cross
between
The

and
Curb

Each
show
is
comprised
of
two
vignettes
from
the
life
of
a
beleaguered
workaday
New

named
Tim
who
despite
his
generally
good
nature
and
sincere
intentions
can't
seem
to
get
through
the
day
without
unwittingly
becoming
a
social
pariah
or
at
best
somebody's
bitch
It's
very
left
field
and
extremely
funny
It's
even
hard
to
explain
why
it's
so
goddam
funny
until
you've
actually
seen
it
but
with
vignette
titles
like
Angry
Unpaid
Hooker
The

you
can
glean

borrowed

similar
to
the
one
used
in
the

these

don't
really
share
Ullman's
gift
for
dialect-perfect
mimicry
but
when
they
do
hit
their
target
it's
a
gut-busting
laugh
riot

most

strange
mix

lowbrow
vulgarity
and
inspired
moments
of
comic
transcendence

most
unhappily

a

existential

than

I"d
also
like
to
suggest
that
this

this
is
an
attempt
by

How
To
Negotiate
With
The
Bush
Administration
by
dday
What
you
do
is
this
You
set
up
a
deadline
and
force
the
White
House
to
negotiate
with
you
as
it
nears
You
ask
for
major
concessions
and
never
stop
asking
for
them
When
the
White
House
demurs
you
say
loudly
to
the
press
that
there
is
likely
to
be
no
deal
Eventually
the
White
House
will
concede
to
your
demands
but
try
to
structure
it
in
such
a
way
that
they
can
still
get
what
they
want
At
that
point
you
agree
to
the
deal
then
take
it
back
to
your
constituents
listen
to
their
concerns
and
turn
right
around
and
reject
the
terms

Sheikh
Jalal

the
deputy
head
of

Shiite
Muslim
Islamic
Supreme
Council
of
Iraq
told

For
this
matter
we
need
national
consensus
I
don't
think
Maliki
is
some
kind
of
genius
signing
this
or
really
any
agreement
with
the
United
States
at
this
point
would
be
political
suicide
But
the
idea
of
listening
to
constituents
is
something
that
nobody
in
this
country
has
bothered
to
consider
when
dealing
with
the
Bush
Administration
for
the
past
8
years
They
might
want
to
give
Baghdad
a
ring
as
for
the
impact
of
this
on
the
occupation
I
would
imagine
the
US
will
seek
to
extend
the
UN
mandate
by
six
months
No
country
on
the
Security
Council
will
attempt
to
block
that
why
not
let
the
American
military
degrade
further
and
lay
out
even
more
of
its
depleted
treasury
But
this
would
be
much
better
for
an
Obama
Administration
because
it
wouldn't
be
constrained
by
an
already-existing
agreement
that
has
a
consensus
in
Iraq
It's
ridiculous
that
Baghdad
is
ultimately
forcing
an
end
to
this
mistake
but

McCain's
Hope
by
digby
Although
I'm
not
sure
about
Stoller's
prediction
of
a
landslide
I'm
superstitious
about
such
things
I'm
pretty
sanguine
about
Obama's
lead
I've
been
pretty
positive
all
year
that
the
Democrats
would
win
except
for
the
scary
period
in
the
late
summer
and
early
fall
when
McCain's
character
assassination
seemed
to
be
gaining
traction
That
little
economic
hiccup
in
late
September
seems
to
have
sobered
everyone
up
However
it's
important
to
keep
focused
and
not
lose
sight
of
just
how
divided
this
country
actually
is
There
are
still
some
people
out
there
who
could
be
swayed
the
wrong
way
at
the
last
minute
if
certain
things
happen
Anonymous
Liberal
gives
a
clear
eyed
rundown
on
what
could
go
wrong
in
this
post
It
will
make
you
sit
up
a
little
bit
straighter
It
probably
won't
happen
But
it
could
and
that
should
make
all
of
us
work
a
little
bit
harder
to
make
sure
it
doesn't
First
I
don't
think
the
early
voting
numbers
are
nearly
as
favorable
to
Obama
as
various
stories
have
made
them
out
to
be
The
most
comprehensive
data
on
early
voting
that
I've
seen
comes
from
the
Obama
campaign
itself
If
you
look
through
the
numbers
Democrats
appear
to
be
voting
at
a
higher
rate
than
they
did
in
2004
in
North
Carolina
Iowa
New
Mexico
Nevada
and
Colorado
but
not
by
ridiculous
margins
We're
talking
5-10
percentage
points
Given
that
Bush
won
Colorado
by
5
and
North
Carolina
by
12
that
may
not
be
enough
And
in
Florida
where
Bush
won
by
5
in
2004
the
ratio
of
Democrat
to
Republican
early
voting
is
unchanged
from
2004
levels
Moreover
the
increased
Democratic
numbers
could
just
be
the
result
of
increased
emphasis
on
banking
votes
i.e
the
Obama
campaign
using
its
resources
to
convince
its
strongest
supporters
to
vote
early
So
while
there
are
some
potentially
encouraging
signs
on
the
early
voting
front
the
data
is
somewhat
ambiguous
and
not
uniformly
in
Obama's
favor
Secondly
while
the
blue
states
are
looking
increasingly
safe
the
overall
electoral
map
is
starting
to
look
a
lot
like
it
did
in
2000
Obama
has
a
solid
lead
in
most
national
polls
and
has
leads
at
or
above
his
national
lead
in
nearly
every
blue
state
except
New
Hampshire
which
has
closed
a
little
lately
He
also
looks
likely
to
bring
Iowa
and
New
Mexico
states
which
Gore
won
but
Kerry
lost
back
into
the
Democratic
fold
But
that's
not
enough
Read
the
whole
thing
It
isn't
pessimistic
Anonymous
Liberal
is
an
enthusiastic
Obama
supporter
from
Illinois
who
believes
this
is
going
to
be
a
major
win
But
he's
not
willing
to
ignore
the
possibility
that
if
things
all
break
a
certain
way
this
last
week
we
could
find
ourselves
in
an
electoral
college
situation
close
to
what
we
had
in
2000
It's
unlikely
but
possible
and
where
Republicans
are
involved
it
pays
to
watch
your
back
and
be
prepared
for
anything

The
Materialism
Pun
by
tristero
This
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
in
terms
of
defining
the
scientific/philosophical
nature
of
materialism
methodological
naturalism
and
the
fundamental
worldview
of
science
Unfortunately
like
most
such
descriptions
it
all
but
ignores
the
rhetorical
sleight-of-hand
that
underlies
much
of
the
advocacy
for
anti-materialism
Steven
Novella
comes
close
to
understanding
it
here
Therefore
the
broader
anti-materialist
movement
of
ID
dualism
and
various
healing
pseudosciences
is
more
accurately
defined
as
anti-naturalism
But
I
guess
for
propaganda
purposes
it
is
better
to
be
against
materialism
than
against
nature.This
is
the
heart
of
the
issue
Scientifically
and
philosophically
materialism
is
non-controversial
Science
can't
say
as
Steven
puts
and
then
there's
a
miracle
Philosophically
dualism
creates
enormous
problems
But
colloquially
and
lets
face
it
these
arguments
are
aimed
at
the
general
public
not
at
anyone
with
any
knowledge
of
philosophy
or
science
materialism
equals
greed
selfishness
vulgarity
the
everyday
the
ordinary
Being
against
materialism
therefore
aligns
oneself
with
higher
aspirations
than
the
accumulation
of
wealth
a
bigger
car
even
social
status
It
is
hard
even
in
a
society
as
warped
as
this
one
towards
rewarding
the
rich
and
greedy
to
be
openly
for
owning
a
third
SUV
What
is
going
on
is
a
kind
of
pun
The
Wedge
Strategy
conflates
the
colloquial
understanding
of
materialism
with
the
technical
A
scientific
worldview
then
can
be
portrayed
as
a
crass
vapid
incomplete
and
unsatisfying
view
of
life
It
is
for
that
reason
that
as
Steve
says
they
are
against
materialism
rather
than
nature
Accordingly
elegant
even
eloquent
defenses
of
the
technical
sense
of
materialism
miss
their
target
The
Wedge
Strategy
is
not
about
reason
but
about
appeals
to
unreason
The
pun
between
materialism
greed
and
materialism
naturalism
is
what
this
confrontation
is
about
and
needs
to
be
very
clearly
acknowledged
when
trying
to
refute
the
Wedge
Strategy
h/t
PZ
UPDATE
Please
don't
get
me
wrong
What
Steven
wrote
is
terrific
I
simply
believe
the
real
issue
is
not
materialism
versus
dualism
say
but
the
Wedge
Strategy's
rhetorical
exploitation
of
a
pun

Beware
The
Lame
Duck
by
digby
You'll
recall
that
the
Republican
Party
took
the
Ohio
secretary
of
state
to
the
state
Supreme
Court
over
minor
mismatches
in
voter
registration
After
the
lawsuit
was
dropped
John
Boehner
and
his
Republican
cronies
sent
a
letter
to
the
Bush
administration
asking
that
the
Department
of
justice
intervene
It
seemed
insane
that
Bush
would
actually
do
anything
like
that
After
all
one
of
their
most
infamous
scandals
was
the
US
Attorney
firings
which
were
proven
to
have
been
political
in
nature
but
never
actually
proved
presidential
involvement
This
would
lay
it
right
at
Bush's
feet
Rick

Roll

this
important
report

President

Buckeye
State
poll-goers

on

Wow
Here
is
what
I
said
earlier
this

The
idea
that
the

would
get
involved
in
the
Ohio
election
now
to
force
Sec
Brunner
to
produce
the
mismatch
list
on
voter
fraud
grounds
seems
remote
The
political
uproar
would
be
deafening
See
also
this

There
should
be
a
political
uproar
but
in
the
blaring
noise
of
the
last
few
days
of
the
election
campaign
people
may
not
hear
about
it
The
president
ordering
the
Department
of
Justice
to
look
into
this
is
a
stunning
violation
of
DOJ
guidelines
and
ethics
But
why
should
he
care
He's
out
the
door
and
the
worst
thing
that
happens
is
that
somebody
accuses
him
of
doing
something
after
the
fact
He
didn't
care
about
it
when
he
was
still
pretending
to
be
a
president
He
certainly
doesn't
care
about
it
now
Republicans
tend
to
lose
their
moorings
when
they
have
nothing

Republicans
vs
Science
by
tristero
Sarah
Palin
isn't
the
issue
here
Sure
I'll
concede
that
this
illustrates
Palin's
breathtaking
ignorance
AND
her
stupidity
After
all
she
agreed
to
repeat
it
But
what
it
really
demonstrates
is
how
unqualified
the
upper
echelons
of
the
Republican
party
are
to
run
this
country
She
certainly
didn't
write
this
speech
John
McCain's
advisers
did
and
approved
every
appalling
word
The
subject
is
government
funding
of
scientific
research
Where
does
a
lot
of
that
earmark
money
end
up
anyway
You've
heard
about
some
of
these
pet
projects
they
really
don't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense
and
sometimes
these
dollars
go
to
projects
that
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
public
good
Things
like
fruit
fly
research
in
Paris
France
I
kid
you
not.If
you
know
anything
at
all
about
science
in
the
21st
century
then
you
know
that
the
study
of
fruit
flies
aka
Drosophilia
melanogaster
has
led
to
some
of
the
most
important
discoveries
in
biology
genetics
and
related
topics
Why
is
that
Embryogenesis
in
Drosophila
has
been
extensively
studied
as
its
small
size
short
generation
time
and
large
brood
size
makes
it
ideal
for
genetic
studies.The
fruit
fly's
utility
in
genetic
research
in
and
of
itself
is
enough
to
justify
its
study
Basic
science
like
the
arts
is
a
worthy
end
that
deserves
federal
support
But
those
genetic
studies
also
have
considerable
ramifications
About
75
of
known
human
disease
genes
have
a
recognizable
match
in
the
genetic
code
of
fruit
flies
Reiter
et
al
2001
Genome
Research
11(6):1114-25
and
50
of
fly
protein
sequences
have
mammalian
analogues
An
online
database
called
Homophila
1
is
available
to
search
for
human
disease
gene
homologues
in
flies
and
vice
versa
Drosophila
is
being
used
as
a
genetic
model
for
several
human
diseases
including
the
neurodegenerative
disorders
Parkinson's
Huntington's
spinocerebellar
ataxia
and
Alzheimer's
disease
The
fly
is
also
being
used
to
study
mechanisms
underlying
aging
and
oxidative
stress
immunity
diabetes
and
cancer
as
well
as
drug
abuse.In
other
words
fruit
fly
research
in
Paris
France
as
if
the
location
of
the
research
has
anything
to
do
with
anything
beyond
access
to
appropriate
tech
and
personnel
is
part
of
a
long
extensive
and
successful
effort
to
find
better
treatments
for
some
of
the
most
intractable
and
horrible
diseases
that
afflict
us
all
Words
fail
me
The
people
who
elevated
Palin
to
national
prominence
who
approved
those
words
belong
nowhere
near
the
power
of

For
a
country
like
the
United

to
have
this
kind
of
garbage
spewing
from
the
mouth
of
a
major

The

Fly
has
infested
thousands
of
California
olive
groves

largest
threat

for

The
USDA
will
use
some
of
that
funding
for
their
research
facility
in
France
This
USDA
research
facility
is
located
in
France
because
Mediterranean
countries
like
France
have
dealt
with
the
Olive
Fruit
Fly
for
decades
while
California
has
only
been
exposed
since
the
late
1990s
This
is
not
uncommon
the
USDA
has
several
international
research
facilities
throughout

including
Australia
China
and
Argentina

Had

even
talking
to

they
would
have
learned
that
our

does
research
in

USDA
facilities
around

world
and
that
none
of
this
money
goes
