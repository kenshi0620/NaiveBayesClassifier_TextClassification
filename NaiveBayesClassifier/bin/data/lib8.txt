Hello
Hi
there
how's
life
in
cyberspace
Sorry
I've
been
gone
for
three
months
Life
takes
you
in
interesting
directions
my
life
took
me
to
a
new
job
in
a
strange
and
distant
land
New
England
Needless
to
say
I
have
been
busy
but
I
intend
to
begin
writing
more
in
the
future
Cheers

Duck
in
a
Can
Fake
duck
but
it
was
greasy
an
dark
and
meaty
like
real
duck
I
don't
think
I
will
eat
it
again
I
like
the
concept
of
fake
meat
but
if
it
is
too
realistic
I
get
all
creeped
out
and
don't
want
to
eat
it

Personally
I
prefer
to

and

crackers...Jesus

Is
this
a

of

holding

Jeebus
You
can
hurry
and
bid
on
it
here
at
eBay
I
caught
this
story
over
here
at
Fables
of
the
Reconstruction
I
personally
think
this
shit
is
just
silly
but
hey
your
money
spend
it
however
you
want
it
Maybe
it
will
find
a
home
beside
the
grilled
cheese
that
looked
like
Elvis
or
Jesus
or
whoever
the
hell
it
looked
like

FoxBlocker
a
sweet
product
So
you
can
order
this
to
screw
into
the
back
of
your
Tv
to
prevent
FoxNews
from
reaching
your
tender
ears/eyes
or
maybe
not
I
get
fooled
by
approx
100
of
all
internet
hoax's....Still
stinging
from
the
whole
Man
Pees
Way
Out
of
avalanche
fiasco
Hey
just
change
the
channel
or
better
yet
watch
the
crap
that
they
spew
and
call
them
on
it
when
the
fuck
up
Although
honestly
if
you
called
them
every
time
they
said
something
stupid
misleading
or
just
plain
wrong
you'd
be
on
the
phone
constantly
A
third
option
would
be
to
read
Newshounds
they
do
the
dirty
work
for
you
They
watch
the
shit
and
tell
you
what
crazy
shit
was
said
Then
you
can
skip
the
middleman
and
jump
straight
to
stunned
outrage

Umm

World
of
Crap
completely
misleading
name
there
was
no
crap
to
be
found
has
a
link
to
this
guy
who
evidently
is
trying
to
draw
an
analogy
between
the
middle
earth
books
and
the
current
geo-political
situation
At
first
I
thought
that
it
sounded
like
the
naive
ramblings
of
someone
that
has
yet
shave
The
more
I
read
it
though
the
more
it
reminded
me
of
our
glorious
leader
could
these
insightful
thoughts
perhaps
come
from
none
other
than
little
George

Condi
Vs
Hillary
Let
me
jump
back
into
the
fray
here
I
wont
bore
you
with
the
reasons
for
my
absence
just
deal
with
it
Just
because
I
haven't
been
blogging
doesn't
mean
I
haven't
been
reading
a
lot
of
Blogs
lately
I've
been
following
the
Gannongate
slutacular
show
over
at
Americablog
They
have
done
some
really
great
posts
on
the
subject
I've
also
been
following
the
Rawstory
and
DU
Democratic
underground
for
some
interesting
articles
All
the
buzz
these
days
seems
to
be
about
Condi
Rice
and
how
she's
going
to
run
for
president
and
save
the
world
and
bake
cookies
Personally
I
doubt
it
although
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
what
would
happen
if
she
did
run
I
suspect
that
the
Republicans
rather
cynically
believe
that
by
running
her
they
can
garner
a
lot
of
female/black
votes
Hate
to
break
it
to
them
but
no
that
is
pretty
much
bullshit
Women
and
minorities
don't
seem
overly
taken
with
her
unless
they
were
predisposed
to
being
Republican
and
I
doubt
that
she
would
be
the
dream
candidate
of
your
average
white
male
Republican
See
the
truth
is
Condi
isn't
Powell
Colin
Powell
comes
across
as
smart
pragmatic
and
essentially
moderate
about
the
crazy
wedge
issues
that
some
Republicans
love
so
much
Oh
yeah
and
he
happens
to
be
black
whatever
Condi
comes
across
as
arrogant
short
sighted
and
a
yes
women
someone
without
ideas
but
with
plenty
of
ambition
Kinda
like
Hillary
Sorry
but
yeah
I
think
Hillary
is
all
about
the
power
she
wants
to
rule
the
world
For
Bill
on
the
other
hand
it
was
all
about
the
BJ's
I
think
that
we
will
not
see
Condi
get
past
the
primaries
and
I
hope
that
we
have
someone
a
little
deeper
than
Hillary
coming
from
the
Democrats
Hillary
has
too
much
in
common
with
Kerry
they've
both
spent
their
lives
in
the
pursuit
of
power
for
powers
sake
that
tends
to
leave
a
nasty
ring
in
the
tub

Out

Reports
of
my
death
are
greatly
exaggerated….but
damn
am
I
busy
I
feel
really
bad
about
semi-abandoning
this
blog
and
I
hope
to

really
soon
My
personal

has
gotten
complicated
to
the
point
where
I
need
to
step
away
for
awhile
I

Saturday
Evening
Pooh
movie
urges
tolerance
FUCK
POOH
Saw
the
new
Pooh
movie
with
my
daughter
this
afternoon
Cute
and
cuddly
and
warm
Everything
a
Pooh
movie
should
be
A
strong
undertone
of
accepting
people
that
are
different
and
the
dangers
of
xenophobia
One
wonders
why
the
religious
conservatives
tolerate
such
tripe
Obviously
this
is
an
attempt
to
destroy
this
country
from
within
Since
when
did
tolerance
and
acceptance
of
strangers
become
American
values
Fuck
the
Red
man
Fuck
the
yellow
man
fuck
the
French
Fuck
anyone
that
doesn't
believe
in
the
Christian
god
Why
not
just
kill
all
the
motherfuckers
that
aren't

Jeeze
I
don't
know
Listening
to
Rainy
Days
and
Mondays
on
Launch
what
To
write
about
It's
a
Monday
and
My
whole
family
is
recovering
from
the
flu
and
I'm
recovering
from
two
days
off
of
work
trying
to
dig
myself
out
of
the
inevitable
pile
of
crap
that
always
results
from
an
unplanned
absence
Iraq
hate
to
say
it
but
same
as
it
ever
was
More
car
bombings
more
dead
Americans
and
Iraqis
No
wonder
most
people
can't
be
bothered
to
pay
attention
They
are
still
counting
votes
over
there
but
it
looks
like
Sistani's
party
is
going
to
be
the
big
winner
That
seems
like
it
might
be
good
for
Iraq
but
not
so
good
for
the
U.S
We
may
end
up
with
a
more
independent
Theocracy
than
we
really
want
Time
will
tell
clichéd
but
true
New
York
court
said
that
maybe
gay
marriage
was
not
quite
as
bad
as
the
conservatives
said
it
was
We'll
have
to
see
where
this
goes
It
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
course
that
the
administration
charts
through
this
political
minefield
If
they
hard
charge
towards
an
amendment
they
will
alienate
the
majority
of
Americans
and
if
they
don't
they
will
weaken
the
base
of
the
party
What
to
do
I
guess
that's
it
for
now
I
don't
feel
especially
funny
or
poignant
tonight
See
you
around

Fucking

So
rumor
has
it
that
the
next
Xbox
will
be
called
Xbox
360
That's
funny
I
thought
when
I
read
the
rumor
Then
I
read
on
and
all
was
made
clear
It
seems
that
some
focus
group
somewhere
picked
MS
was
worried
that
calling
xbox
2
would
make
it
sound
old
and
tired
when
compared
to
say
playstation

Long
live
the
focus
group
Maybe
someday
in
a
happy
shiny
future
all
decisions
can
be
made
by
focus
groups
