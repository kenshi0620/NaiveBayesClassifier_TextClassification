the

Stupid

You
didn't
see
a
single
one
of
these
stupid
ugly
rumors
promoted
by
LGF
and
we're
proud
of
that
Shame
on
the
right-wing
bloggers
who
let
their
fears
convince
them
to
throw
their
credibility
away
you
know
who
they
are
This
stuff
has
been
very
damaging
to
the
McCain
campaign
and
has
probably
contributed
to
Barack
Obama's
ability
to
skate
on
the
real
issue
of
his
long
history
of
associations
with
some
of
the
most
radical
extremists
in
America
Cover
this
Inside
the
nastiest
08
rumors
They
missed
one
though
the
Bill
Ayers
was
the
ghostwriter
for
Barack
Obama's
books
rumor
And
what
about
the
absolutely
insane
garbage
about
Sarah
Palin
promoted
by
idiots
like
Andrew
Sullivan
Sullivan
spent
weeks
demanding
that
Palin
submit
to
DNA
testing
to
prove
she
and
not
her
daughter
was
the
mother
of
Trig
Palin
That
doesn't

Rashid
Khalidi
and
the
PLO
Politics
Thu
Oct
30
2008
at
3:41:04
pm
PDT
As
the
subject
of
Barack
Obama's
friend
Rashid
Khalidi
has
gained
traction
in
the
media
and
the
blogosphere
one
of
the
talking
points
parroted
by
Obama
apologists
is
that
Khalidi
was
never
a
spokesman
for
Yasser
Arafat's
Palestinian
Liberation
Organization
at
a
time
when
it
was
listed
as
a
terrorist
group
by
the
US
government
But
is
it
true
that
Khalidi
was
not
affiliated
with
the
PLO
In
a
word
no
Khalidi
of
the
PLO
As
for
Khalidi's
denial
there
are
ample
grounds
to
question
it
In
2004
when
he
made
it
Khalidi
wrote
that
between
1976
and
1983
I
was
teaching
full
time
as
an
Assistant
Professor
in
the
Political
Studies
and
Public
Administration
Dept
at
the
American
University
of
Beirut
published
two
books
and
several
articles
and
also
was
a
research
fellow
at
the
independent
Institute
for
Palestine
Studies
Khalidi
claimed
he
had
time
for
little
else
I
often
spoke
to
journalists
in
Beirut
who
usually
cited
me
without
attribution
as
a
well-informed
Palestinian
source
If
some
misidentified
me
at
the
time
I
am
not
aware
of
it
Now
if
someone
misidentified
me
on
the
pages
of
the
New
York
Times
Tom
Friedman
no
less
I'm
sure
I
would
be
aware
of
it
So
would
you
Yet
Khalidi
did
not
seek
a
correction
of
Friedman's
characterization
at
the
time
although
the
Times
regularly
issues
corrections
of
such
mistakes
and
presumably
would
have
done
the
same
for
Khalidi
Khalidi's
self-description
as
being
a
preoccupied
professor
while
in
Beirut
also
contradicts
a
statement
he
made
in
a
2005
interview
After
listing
the
stations
in
his
academic
career
he
is
asked
this
question
You
were
also
involved
politically
as
well
Khalidi
Well
yes
I
was
deeply
involved
in
politics
in
Beirut
It
is
worth
explaining
what
it
meant
to
be
deeply
involved
in
politics
in
Beirut
during
the
civil
war
in
Lebanon
It
was
not
at
all
like
community
organizing
in
Chicago
The
Lebanese
state
had
ceased
to
function
the
political
actors
were
all
armed
militias
Lebanese
and
Palestinian
Every
individual
needed
to
be
affiliated
with
such
an
organization
if
not
for
bread
then
at
least
for
protection
Khalidi
was
known
to
be
affiliated
with
and
protected
by
Arafat's
Fatah
A
1979
New
York
Times
report
by
Youssef
Ibrahim
described
Khalidi
as
a
professor
of
political
science
who
is
close
to
Al
Fatah
In
Beirut
to
be
close
to
an
organization
meant
you
enjoyed
its
protection
in
return
for
loyalty
and
services
rendered
Khalidi's
wife
also
worked
as
an
English
translator
for
the
PLO's
press
agency
Wafa
So
savvy
journalists
knew
that
if
they
wanted
the
Fatah
spin
they
could
get
it
from
Khalidi

A
Note
to
the
Hoi
Polloi
Humor
Thu
Oct

at
2:20:42
pm
PDT
This
is
why
I
call
the
dreaded
Iowahawk
some
kinda
damn
genius
As
a
Conservative
I
Must
Say
I
Do
Quite
Like
the
Cut
of
this
Obama
Fellow's
Jib
When
my
late
father
T
Coddington
Van
Voorhees
VI
founded
the
iconoclastic
conservative
journal
National
Topsider
in
1948
he
famously
declared
that
Now
is
the
time
for
all
good
conservative
helmsmen
to
hoist
the
mizzen
pour
the
cocktails
and
steer
this
damned
schooner
hard
starboard
In
the
60
years
since
he
first
uttered
it
after
one-too-many
Cosmopolitans
at
one
of
Pamela
Harriman's
notorious
foreign
policy
black
tie
balls
father's
pithy
bon
mot
has
served
as
a
rallying
cry
for
conservatives
from
Greenwich
to
Chevy
Chase
Today
I
say
it's
time
for
we
conservatives
to
once
again
grab
the
rigging
and
set
sail
with
the
flotilla
of
the
true
conservative
in
this
race
Barack
Obama
Trust
me
I
haven't
taken
this
tack
lightly
No
Van
Voorhees
has
supported
an
avowed
socialist
since
great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great
grandpapa
Cragmont
Van
Voorhees
lent
Peter
Minuet
24
and
a
sack
of
wampum
to
swing
a
subprime
mortgage
on
Manhattan
Island
Old
dad
himself
often
recounted
how
as
a
lad
he
would
command
the
family
chauffeur
Carleton
to
drive
the
Duesenberg
down
to
the
Times
Square
Trans-Lux
so
he
could
hiss
Roosevelt
But
I've
taken
a
good
measure
of
this
Obama
fellow
and
I
must
say
I
like
the
cut
of
the
man's
jib
How
can
I
say
this
you
ask
One
look
at
this
Obama
chap
is
all
the
answer
you
need
Suave
tanned
unflappable
Harvard
connections
it's
obvious
that
here
is
a
man
to
the
conservative
manor
born
One
imagines
him
at
the
helm
of
the
Ship
of
State
basked
in
the
sunlight
diffusing
through
the
seaspray
over
the
bow
like
some
beautiful
rugged
Othello
from
a
rapturous
Ralph
Lauren
catalog
calmly
issuing
instructions
to
the
deck
crew
in
that
magnificent
mellifluous
baritone
of
his
It's
that
easy-going
almost
effortless
grace
that
has
all
the
A-list
conservatives
like
David
Frum
and
Kathleen
Parker
whispering
Reaganesque
in
hushed
tones
Even
Peggy
Noonan
the
Grand
Dame
of
Gipperism
has
succumbed
to
Obama's
undeniable
conservative
charms
Just
last
month
I
listened
to
her
wax
poetic
about
the
Adonis
of
Chicago
between
chukkers
at
the
Newport
Club
polo
tournament
final
Why
Peggy
you
old
dowager
I
quipped
I
believe
you
just
had
an
orgasm
Certainly
my
endorsement
has
raised
more
than
a
few
eyebrows
around
the
National
Topsider
water
cooler
particularly
among
the
alumni
of
jejune
cow
colleges
like
Michigan
or
Dartmouth
They
sometimes
point
to
Mr
Obama's
radical
Rolodex
and
his
hooey
about
weath
redistribution
and
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
But
as
I
patiently
explain
this
is
precisely
the
point
it
is
hooey
over-the-top
rhetorical
flourishes
obviously
designed
by
Mr
Obama
to
win
over
benighted
inner
city
hoi
polloi
a
feat
I
might
add
that
even
the
Great
Communicator
himself
was
unable
to
accomplish
As
for
his
so-called
radical
ties
who
among
us
hasn't
sent
dinner
party
invitations
to
Gore
Vidal
and
a
leftwing
terrorists
or
two
to
enliven
the
postprandial
conversation
Leonard
Bernstein
loved
hosting
all
manner
of
Weathermen
and
Black
Panthers
and
Symbionese
Liberation
Army
celebrities
at
his
Park
Avenue
pied
a
terre
but
it
didn't
mean
the
Maestro
wasn't
in
favor
of
low
taxes
On
the
contrary
I
know
for
a
fact
he
itemized
every
cent
of
the
catering
bills
for
his
famous
terrorist
cocktail
parties

A

Protest
Update

Says
Releasing
the
Video
Might
Put
the
Source

Jeopardy
Media
Thu
Oct

11:55:41
am

LGF
reader
cblesz
went
to
the
protest
at
the
LA
Times
building
this
morning
and
reports
that
there
were
about
150
people
there
and
that
LA
Times
staffers
were
watching
from
the
windows
smirking
and
laughing
at
the
protesters
UPDATE
at
12:03:21
pm
The
Times
has
settled
on
their
excuse
now
another
reader
forwarded
the
email
he
received
from
Gary
Weitman
spokesman
for
the
Times
parent
company
Tribune
Mr
Smith
I'm
sorry
you
feel
this
way
I
understand
this
may
be
frustrating
to
you
Allow
me
to
explain
further
Protecting
confidential
sources
and
standing
by
agreements
made
in
order
to
get
information
is
a
cornerstone
of
good
fundamental
journalism
and
a
free
press
If
we
break
an
agreement
with
a
source
we
risk
other
sources
not
coming
forward
with
information
vital
to
the
public
In
this
case
the
tape
was
written
about
extensively
and
only
came
to
light
because
the
LA
Times
made
a
promise
not
to
publish
it
or
reveal
its
source
That
promise
means
not
publishing
the
tape
even
to
a
high
level
conservative
however
turstworthy
that
person
may
be
Despite
the
public
pressure
it
is
important
that
the
LA
Times
honor
its
agreement
Thanks
Gary
Weitman
Now
go
away
and
stop
bothering
us
peon
he
didn't
add
But
he
might
as
well
have
I'm
not
going
to
mince
words
I
don't
believe
the
LA
Times
is
telling
the
truth
when
they
say
they
had
an
agreement
with
their
source
not
to
reveal
the
tape
UPDATE
at
12:38:36
pm
And
yet
another
version
of
the
excuse
also
from
Weitman
courtesy
of
LGF
reader
jbolty
I
completely
agree
about
the
role
of
the
press
being
a
watchdog
on
government
abuse
The
LA
Times
as
you
know
brought
this
story
to
light
in
the
first
place
and
described
what
was
going
on
on
the
tape
The
reporter
on
the
story
has
written
extensively
about
Barack
Obama's
relationship
to
the
Khalidi
family
The
reporter
agreed
with
his
source
not
to
release
the
tape
in
return
for
getting
acess
to
it
The
Times
has
made
it
clear
last
night
online
and
in
today's
newspaper
that
it
will
honor
that
agreement
That
is
what
you'd
want
I
would
think
protection
of
a
source
in
return
for
getting
the
underlying
information
To
break
that
agreement
might
put
the
source
of
the
tape
in
jeopardy
Honoring
the
agreement
allows
the
newspaper
to
continue
to
get
information
from
other
sources
and
assures
those
sources
of
information
that
they
can
come
forward
confidentially
Releasing
the
video
would
put
the
source
in
jeopardy
Is
this
an
admission
that
there's
something
damaging
on
the
tape

Martin
Kramer
on
Rashid
Khalidi
and
Barack
Obama
Kindred
Spirits
Politics
Thu
Oct
30
2008
at
9:40:46
am
PDT
Martin
Kramer
has
been
following
the
career
of
former
PLO
spokesman
Rashid
Khalidi
for
years
and
is
convinced
that
Khalidi's
moderation
is
a
sham
Khalidi
and
Obama
kindred
spirits
Were
we
to
see
the
videotape
it
might
give
us
some
sense
of
how
far
down
the
road
Obama
went
in
that
anti-Israel
direction
and
not
all
that
long
ago
It
would
be
interesting
to
know
for
example
if
there
was
reference
to
Iraq
In
2003
when
Khalidi's
friends
gave
him
his
goodbye
party
he
was
deep
into
propagandizing
against
the
Iraq
war
Among
his
arguments
he
included
this
one
This
war
will
be
fought
because
these
neoconservatives
desire
to
make
the
Middle
East
safe
not
for
democracy
but
for
Israeli
hegemony
They
are
convinced
that
the
Middle
East
is
irremediably
hostile
to
both
the
United
States
and
Israel
and
they
firmly
hold
the
racist
view
that
Middle
Easterners
understand
only
force
For
these
American
Likudniks
and
their
Israeli
counterparts
sad
to
say
the
tragedy
of
September
11
was
a
godsend
It
enabled
them
to
draft
the
United
States
to
help
fight
Israel's
enemies
This
argument
against
the
war
was
not
at
all
unusual
on
the
faculty
of
the
University
of
Chicago
at
the
time
Another
professor
of
Middle
East
history
Fred
Donner
gave
it
blatant
expression
on
the
pages
of
the
Chicago
Tribune
calling
the
Iraq
war
a
vision
deriving
from
Likud-oriented
members
of
the
president's
team
particularly
Richard
Perle
Paul
Wolfowitz
and
Douglas
Feith
So
perhaps
it
is
not
surprising
that
Obama
in
his
October
2002
antiwar
speech
declared
What
I
am
opposed
to
is
the
cynical
attempt
by
Richard
Perle
and
Paul
Wolfowitz
and
other
arm-chair
weekend
warriors
in
this
Administration
to
shove
their
own
ideological
agendas
down
our
throats
irrespective
of
the
costs
in
lives
lost
and
in
hardships
borne
No
mention
of
Cheney
or
Rumsfeld
and
no
need
to
mention
them
to
a
constituency
that
knew
who
was
really
behind
the
push
for
war
and
why
Later
the
same
argument
would
figure
prominently
in
The
Israel
Lobby
co-authored
by
another
Chicago
professor
John
Mearsheimer
Obama
when
pressed
during
an
appearance
before
a
Jewish
audience
admitted
that
I
do
know
him
Khalidi
because
I
taught
at
the
University
of
Chicago
This
sounds
wholly
innocuous
I
also
know
Khalidi
because
I
taught
at
the
University
of
Chicago
twice
in
1990
and
1991
when
I
had
an
office
on
the
same
hall
Obama
continues
And
I
do
know
him
and
I
have
had
conversations
Well
even
I've
had
conversations
with
Khalidi
A
former
Chicago
graduate
student
who
must
keep
meticulous
records
writes
to
me
that
he
spotted
me
on
December
6
1990
at

Khalidi
introduced
me
to
Edward
Said
in
New

in
November
1986
The
difference
is
that
while
I
came
away
from
these
encounters
convinced
that
Khalidi's
purported
moderation
was
a
sham
and
have
said
so
Obama
went
the
other
direction
maintaining
their
friendship
right
up
to
Khalidi's
send-off
from
Chicago
to
which
he
contributed
an
encomium
Which
is
why
I'd
really
like
to
see
that
videotape
I'm
just
curious
which
of
Rashid
Khalidi's
virtues
I
somehow
missed

Wed

Among
the
many
promises
and
pledges
in
Barack
Obama's
multi-million
dollar
infomercial
one
statement
really
stood
out
he
announced
that
he
will
rebuild
the
military
But
somehow
at
the
same
time
he's
planning
a
civilian
national
security
force
that
is
as
powerful
and
well-funded
as
the
US
military
Obama
outlines
plan
for
national
service
We
cannot
continue
to
rely
only
on
our
military
in
order
to
achieve
the
national
security
objectives
that
we've
set
he
said
Wednesday
We've
got
to
have
a
civilian
national
security
force
that's
just
as
powerful
just
as
strong
just
as
well
funded
The
Department
of
Defense's
current
base
budget
is
close
to
500
billion
So
if
he
meant
that
promise
he
plans
on
a
total
defense
budget
of
about
a
trillion
dollars
What
exactly
is
Obama
planning
to
do
with
a
civilian
force
with
such
an
astronomical
level
of
funding

Barack
Obama
is
mocking
the
charges
that
he
promotes
socialist
ideology
Obama
ridicules
McCain
charge
he's
socialist
RALEIGH
N.C
AP
Barack
Obama
accused
Republican
rival
John
McCain
on
Wednesday
of
stooping
to
low
tactics
by
labeling
the
Democrat
a
socialist
I
don't
know
what's
next
Obama
the
presidential
candidate
said
at
an
outdoor
rally
in
North
Carolina
By
the
end
of
the
week
he'll
be
accusing
me
of
being
a
secret
communist
because
I
shared
my
toys
in
kindergarten
I
shared
my
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
But
if
he
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
socialism
why
did
the
Chicago
Democratic
Socialists
of
America
strongly
recommend
Obama
for
Congressman
New
Ground
69
Chicago
Democratic
Socialists
of
America
Barak
Obama
is
serving
only
his
second
term
in
the
Illinois
State
Senate
so
he
might
be
fairly
charged
with
ambition
but
the
same
might
have
be
said
of
Bobby
Rush
when
he
ran
against
Congressman
Charles
Hayes
Obama
also
has
put
in
time
at
the
grass
roots
working
for
five
years
as
a
community
organizer
in
Harlem
and
in
Chicago
When
Obama
participated
in
a
1996
UofC
YDS
Townhall
Meeting
on
Economic
Insecurity
much
of
what
he
had
to
say
was
well
within
the
mainstream
of
European
social
democracy
If
anyone
can
recognize
socialism
it
would
be
the
Democratic
Socialists
of
America
Of
course
Obama
himself
admitted
openly
that
he
attended
socialist
conferences
at
Cooper
Union
while
he
attended
Columbia
University
He
also
admitted
that
he
sought
out
Marxist
professors
And
now
he's
pulling
the
socialist
wool
over
America's
eyes

What
is
the
L.A
Times
Hiding
Politics
Wed
Oct
29
2008
at
3:39:30
pm
PDT
The
Atlantic's
Jeffrey
Goldberg
asks
a
simple
question
What
is
the
L.A
Times
Hiding
There's
a
video
out
there
of
Obama
saying
kind
things
about
Khalidi
and
on
the
general
principle
that
information
in
an
open
society
shouldn't
be
kept
secret
and
that
the
voters
should
make
up
their
own
minds
about
whether
or
not
they
trust
certain
candidates
this
video
should
be
set
free
But
a
pro-censorship
organization
called
the
Los
Angeles
Times
which
has
the
tape
in
its
possession
is
hiding
it
for
reasons
it
won't
fully
explain
And
it's
looking
more
and
more
ridiculous
each
passing
day
I
understand
that
the
tape
was
leaked
to
the
Times
by
a
source
or
sources
unknown
and
that
an
agreement
was
struck
with
that
source
to
keep
the
tape
hidden
but
the
tape
has
been
described
in
a
Times
story
already
and
it
quite
obviously
contains
no
state
secrets
I
also
suspect
that
the
tape
could
be
posted
in
such
a
way
as
to
obscure
its
origins
The
Times
however
won't
discuss
in
detail
why
it's
keeping
the
tape
from
its
readers
and
the
newspaper's
readers
representative
Jamie
Gold
has
lined
up
against
the
readers
and
argued
against
the
release
of
the
tape
If
this
is
even
being
noticed
by
The
Atlantic
you
know
the
story
is
gaining
some
serious
traction
and
the
reputation
of
the
Los
Angeles
Times
is
in
serious
danger
Of
course
they
haven't
had
much
credibility
at
LGF
for
a
long
long
time

Back
in
April
we
reported
on
a
page
at
the
Barack
Obama
website
belonging
to
a
fundraiser
named
Hatem
Elhady
former
chairman
of
the
Hamas-linked
Islamic
charity
Kindhearts
One
of
the
friends
listed
on
Elhady's
page
was
none
other
than
Michelle
Obama
and
we
have
the
screenshots
to
prove
it
When
this
page
was
exposed
at
LGF
the
Obama
campaign
first
erased
Michelle
Obama's
name
from
the
page
then
shortly
afterward
the
entire
page
disappeared
I'm
reposting
these
LGF
articles
below
because
they
got
virtually
no
attention
at
the
time
Another

El-Hady

now
devoted

he
has

at
the

campaign
web

with
three
friends
listed
on
it
Rick
Fatima
from
Toledo
Ohio
and
Michelle

Note
when
someone
is
listed
as
a
friend
it
means
they
specifically
chose
it
In
other
words
Michelle
Obama's
name
isn't
there
because
El-Hady
put
it
there
it's
there
because
she
chose
to

Hatem

former
chairman
of
the
Toledo-based
Islamic
charity

closed
by
the
US

in

has
now
devoted
himself
to
raising
money
for
the
Barack
Obama
campaign
He
has
a
web
page
at
the
official
Obama
campaign
site
On
Wednesday
when
we
posted
about
El-Hady
there
were
three
friends
listed
on
his
page
and
one
of
them
was
none
other
than
Barack
Obama's
wife
Michelle
Obama
But
this
morning
there
are
suddenly
only
two
friends
listed
on
that
page
Guess
whose
name
disappeared
There's
a
lot
of
talk
about
William
Ayers
and
his
connections
to
Obama
but
please
note
that
in
El-Hady
we
have
someone
who
is
apparently
connected
with
Hamas
not
decades
ago
but
as
recently
as
2006
Here's
our
post
at
the
time
including

thinking
no

would

Encouragement

Politics
Wed

10:30:12
am

The
Washington
Post
finally
starts
to
cover
the
real
issue
in
the
Barack
Obama
campaign's
acceptance
of
fraudulent
credit
card
donations
the
fact
that
the
campaign
has
deliberately
disabled
the
online
payment
industry's
standard
safeguards
against
fraud
Obama
Accepting
Untraceable
Donations
Sen
Barack
Obama's
presidential
campaign
is
allowing
donors
to
use
largely
untraceable
prepaid
credit
cards
that
could
potentially
be
used
to
evade
limits
on
how
much
an
individual
is
legally
allowed
to
give
or
to
mask
a
contributor's
identity
campaign
officials
confirmed
Faced
with
a
huge
influx
of
donations
over
the
Internet
the
campaign
has
also
chosen
not
to
use
basic
security
measures
to
prevent
potentially
illegal
or
anonymous
contributions
from
flowing
into
its
accounts
aides
acknowledged
Instead
the
campaign
is
scrutinizing
its
books
for
improper
donations
after
the
money
has
been
deposited
The
Obama
organization
said
its
extensive
review
has
ensured
that
the
campaign
has
refunded
any
improper
contributions
and
noted
that
Federal
Election
Commission
rules
do
not
require
front-end
screening
of
donations

Lots
of
people
have
emailed
the

to
this
Associated
Press
video
showing
the
effort
to
get
out
the
vote
for
Barack
Obama
in
the
Gaza
Strip
Youtube
Video
It's
important
to
note
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
free
speech
in
the
Gaza
Strip
the
terrorist
group
Hamas
keeps
an
iron
grip
on

This
story
could
not
have
gone
out
and
Abu
Jayab
could
not
have
appeared
in
it
without
Hamas
explicit
cooperation
and
approval
This
is
an
endorsement
of

WBEZ
Chicago
Public

has
apparently
pulled
offline
all
of
their
audio
recordings
including
the
ones
with
Barack
Obama
talking
about
redistribution
of
wealth
and
comparing
America
to
Nazi
Germany
I
emailed
the
station
yesterday
morning
to
ask
if
they
had
removed
the
audio
or
if
they
were
having
technical
problems
and
received
no
reply
Are
they
deliberately
hiding
these
recordings
It
certainly
looks
that
way
You
can
contact
WBEZ
and
ask
them
yourself
Maybe
you'll
have
better
luck
getting
an
answer
from
them

Doug
Ross
has
received
a
tip
from
a
reader
he
says
has
been
reliable
in
the
past
with
some
inside
information
on
the
videotape
that
the
Los
Angeles
Times
continues
to
hide
Saw
a
clip
from
the
tape
Reason
we
can't
release
it
is
because
statements
Obama
said
to
rile
audience
up
during
toast
He
congratulates
Khalidi
for
his
work
saying
Israel
has
no
God-given
right
to
occupy
Palestine
plus
there's
been
genocide
against
the
Palestinian
people
by
Israelis
It
would
be
really
controversial
if
it
got
out
Tha's
why
they
will
not
even
let
a
transcript
get
out
Caveat
I
can't
vouch
for
the
accuracy
of
this
However
it
certainly
would
explain
why
the
LA
Times
is
suppressing
the
video

at
Columbia

and
his

in
the
anti-apartheid
movement
which
brought
him

Would

all
happened
to
live
in

could
a

at

be
the
original
connection
between
Obama
and

This
report
has
a
surprising
amount
of
information
you
probably
haven't
seen
before
because
the

A
revealing
comment
by
the

of
the
San

chapter
of
the
Saudi-funded
radical
front
group
calling
itself
the
Muslim
Student
Association
MSA
Chapter
Official
Don't
Vote
Destroy
In
the
final
days
of
the
2008
Presidential
election
season
with
just
6
days
now
remaining
until
voters
cast
their
ballots
both
campaigns
are
carefully
maneuvering
to
gain
an
edge
while
still
others
are
singularly
focused
on
just
getting
out
the
vote
Regardless
of
the
outcome
desired
by
these
activists
there
seems
to
be
one
unified
message
across
the
American
political
spectrum
these
days
Participate
in
our
democratic
system
However
one
college's
Muslim
student
organization
has
sought
to
air
a
completely
different
message
regarding
the
election
that
of
the
Islamists
A
student
named
Farhad
Akbari
posted
an
essay
on
the
internal
Yahoo
Group
of
the
Muslim
Student
Association
MSA
at
San
Diego
Mesa
College
on
October
14
In
his
post
The
Issue
of
Voting
Akbari
delves
into
the
election
warning
his
fellow
group
members
of
the
fate
in
store
for
those
who
cast
a
ballot
for
a
person
who
fights
Islam
governs
contrary
to
Islam
and
is
himself
a
kafir
infidel
or
unbeliever
Akbari
does
not
reserve
this
treatment
for
any
specific
candidate
Rather
he
holds
both
major
party
candidates
in
equal
regard
Continuing
in
his
reproach
of
American
democracy
Akbari
writes
Whether
you
vote
for
the
white
kafir
or
the
half-black
kafir
they
will
kill
our
brothers
and
sisters
They
will
subjugate
our
brothers
and
sisters
And
they
will
certainly
support
Israel
in
killing
our
brothers
and
sisters
There
is
no
lesser
of
two
evils
here
They
are
both
greater
evils
The
lesser
evil
is
avoiding
the
situation
as
both
are
equally
poisonous
to
the
cause
of
Islam
Brothers
and
sisters

Tue

The
world's
dumbest
leftist
blogger
puts
his
scary
racism
attack
face
on
To
Attack
Obama
Little
Green
Footballs
Defends
Segregation
I'll
try
to
explain
this
to
you
Olly
although
I
have
no
confidence
you'll
understand
the
point
or
acknowledge
it
even
if
you
do
First
your
title
is
an
outright
lie
There
was
not
one
word
of
my
post
that
defended
segregation
Here's
what
I
wrote
At
about
15:30
Obama
compares
what
was
going
on
in
the
United
States
during
the
time
of
Brown
vs
the
Board
of
Education
to
Nazi
Germany
Yes
really
Here's
the
quote
just
to
take
a
sort
of
a
realist
perspective...there's
a
lot
of
change
going
on
outside
of
the
Court
um
that
that
judges
essentially
have
to
take
judicial
notice
of
I
mean
you've
got
World
War
II
you've
got
uh
uh
uh
the
doctrines
of
Nazism
that
that
we
are
fighting
against
that
start
looking
uncomfortably
similar
to
what
we
have
going
on
back
here
at
home
There
you
have
it
America
is
close
to
electing
a
President
who
compares
his
own
country
to
Nazi
Germany
Not
one
word
of
that
post
defends
segregation
and
not
a
single
comment
from
an
LGF
reader
defends
segregation
The
point
is
simple
and
really
not
hard
to
understand
unless
you're
Oliver
Willis
as
bad
as
segregation
was
and
it
was
terrible
to
compare
America
during
the
time
of
Brown
vs
the
BOE
when
we
were
dismantling
segregation
to
genocidal
Nazi
Germany
with
its
pogroms
death
camps
and
forced
labor
camps
and
more
than
six
million
murders
is
not
just
ludicrous
and
wrong
it
is
a
morally
bankrupt
argument
that
verges
on
Holocaust
denial
Now
watch
Olly
come
back
with
another
idiotic
post
calling
me
a
racist
for
any
old
excuse
he
can
make
up
This
is
the
kind
of
garbage
that's
standard
fare
in
the
fever
swamp
blogosphere

As

Friday
shortly
after

debate
Ohio
government
computers
were
used
to
look
up
personal

on
Joe

Today
one

involved
in

system

some
dirt
has
been
outed
Inspector

personal
information
Ohio's
inspector

is
investigating
why
a
state
agency
director
approved
checking
the
state
child-support
computer
system
for
information
on
Joe

Helen
Jones-Kelly
director
of
the
Ohio
Department
of
Job
and
Family
Services
confirmed
today
that
she
OK'd
the
check
on
Samuel
Joseph
Wurzelbacher
following
the
Oct
15
presidential
debate
She
said
there
were
no
political
reasons
for
the
check
on
the
sudden
presidential
campaign
fixture
though
the
Support
Enforcement
Tracking
System
Amid
questions
from
the
media
and
others
about
Joe
the
Plumber
Jones-Kelley
said
she
approved
a
check
to
determine
if
he
was
current
on
any
ordered
child-support
payments
Such
information
was
not
and
cannot
be
publicly
shared
she
said
It
is
unclear
if
Wurzelbacher
is
involved
in
a
child-support
case
Reports
state
that
he
lives
alone
with
a
13-year-old
son
Our
practice
is
when
someone
is
thrust
quickly
into
the
public
spotlight
we
often
take
a
look
at
them
Jones-Kelley
said
citing
a
case
where
a
lottery
winner
was
found
to
owe
past-due
child
support
Our
practice
is
to
basically
look
at
what
is
coming
our
way
And
if
you
believe
that
maybe
I
can
convince
you
the
moon
landings
were
faked

Another
Redistribution
Statement
from
Obama
Surfaces
Politics
Tue
Oct
28
2008
at
12:32:16
pm
PDT
He's
doing
everything
he
can
to
downplay
and
disavow
it
now
but
Barack
Obama
has
been
talking
about
the
redistribution
of
wealth
for
quite
a
long
time
since
the
beginning
of
his
political
career
in
fact
Ed
Morrissey
links
to
an
article
from
the
March-April
1996
issue
of
New
Ground
the
official
journal
of
the
Chicago
Democratic
Socialists
of
America
who
endorsed
Obama
New
Ground
45
Chicago
Democratic
Socialists
of
America
One
of
the
themes
that
has
emerged
in
Barack
Obama's
campaign
is
what
does
it
take
to
create
productive
communities
not
just
consumptive
communities
It
is
an
issue
that
joins
some
of
the
best
instincts
of
the
conservatives
with
the
better
instincts
of
the
left
He
felt
the
state
government
has
three
constructive
roles
to
play
The
first
is
human
capital
development
By
this
he
meant
public
education
welfare
reform
and
a
workforce
preparation
strategy
Public
education
requires
equality
in
funding
It's
not
that
money
is
the
only
solution
to
public
education's
problems
but
it's
a
start
toward
a
solution
The
current
proposals
for
welfare
reform
are
intended
to
eliminate
welfare
but
it's
also
true
that
the
status
quo
is
not
tenable
A
true
welfare
system
would
provide
for
medical
care
child
care
and
job
training
While
Barack
Obama
did
not
use
this
term
it
sounded
very
much
like
the
social
wage
approach
used
by
many
social
democratic
labor
parties
By
workforce
preparation
strategy
Barack
Obama
simply
meant
a
coordinated
purposeful
program
of
job
training
instead
of
the
ad
hoc
fragmented
approach
used
by
the
State
of
Illinois
today
The
state
government
can
also
play
a
role
in
redistribution
the
allocation
of
wages
and
jobs
As
Barack
Obama
noted
when
someone
gets
paid
10
million
to
eliminate
4,000
jobs
the
voters
in
his
district
know
this
is
an
issue
of
power
not
economics
The
government
can
use
as
tools
labor
law
reform
public
works
and
contracts

Politico
Yes
We're
Biased
So
What
Media
Tue
Oct
28
2008
at
10:15:12
am
PDT
Politico
reporters
Jim
VandeHei
and
John
F
Harris
examine
the
claim
that
the
media
are
overwhelmingly
biased
against
the
McCain
campaign
conclude
that
it's
true
and
then
sum
up
their
response
in
two
words
So
what
Why
McCain
is
getting
hosed
in
the
press
OK
let's
just
get
this
over
with
Yes
in
the
closing
weeks
of
this
election
John
McCain
and
Sarah
Palin
are
getting
hosed
in
the
press
and
at
Politico
And
yes
based
on
a
combined
35
years
in
the
news
business
we'd
take
an
educated
guess
nothing
so
scientific
as
a
Pew
study
that
Obama
will
win
the
votes
of
probably
80
percent
or
more
of
journalists
covering
the
2008
election
Most
political
journalists
we
know
are
centrists
instinctually
skeptical
of
ideological
zealotry
but
with
at
least
a
mild
liberal
tilt
to
their
thinking
particularly
on
social
issues
So
what
You
see
political
journalists
are
a
special
breed
of
human
being
Responsible
editors
would
be
foolish
not
to
ask
themselves
the
bias
question
especially
in
the
closing
days
of
an
election
But
having
asked
it
our
sincere
answer
is
that
of
the
factors
driving
coverage
of
this
election
and
making
it
less
enjoyable
for
McCain
to
read
his
daily
clip
file
than
for
Obama
ideological
favoritism
ranks
virtually
nil
The
main
reason
is
that
for
most
journalists
professional
obligations
trump
personal
preferences
Most
political
reporters
investigative
journalists
tend
to
have
a
different
psychological
makeup
are
temperamentally
inclined
to
see
multiple
sides
of
a
story
and
being
detached
from
their
own
opinions
comes
relatively
easy
So
there
you
have
it
Stop
complaining
about
bias
and
accept
the
opinions
of
your
betters

on

Video
Politics
Tue
Oct
28
2008
at
8:57:21
am
PDT
At
the
Washington
Post
Howard
Kurtz
takes
notice
of
the
Los
Angeles
Times
refusal
to
release
a
videotape
of
Barack
Obama
at
a
party
for
former
PLO
spokesman
Rashid
Khalidi
Kurtz
calls
him
a
Palestinian
rights
advocate
and
Israel
critic
And
the
McCain
campaign
has
noticed
this
too
The
L.A
Times
ran
a
story
last
April
about
a
2003
party
at
which
Obama
said
nice
things
about
Palestinian
rights
advocate
and
Israel
critic
Rashid
Khalidi
who
he
said
reminds
him
of
my
own
blind
spots
and
my
own
biases
It's
for
that
reason
that
I'm
hoping
that
for
many
years
to
come
we
continue
that
conversation
a
conversation
that
is
necessary
not
just
around
Mona
and
Rashid's
dinner
table
but
around
this
entire
world
The
McCain
camp
tells
me
the
paper
refused
to
release
a
videotape
of
the
remarks
that
it
had
obtained
Little
Green
Footballs
calls
that
media
malfeasance
of
an
almost
astounding
degree
They
have
a
video
that
could
change
the
stakes
in
this
election
and
they're
hiding
it
We're
not
a
video
service
Doyle
McManus
the
Times
Washington
bureau
chief
tells
me
We're
not
suppressing
anything
We
were
the
first
to
report
on
these
facts
He
declines
to
say
whether
the
paper
considered
posting
the
video
The
Los
Angeles
Times
is
currently
hemorrhaging
readers
laying
off
employees
and
losing
advertisers
Releasing
this
video
would
be
very
good
for
their
bottom
line
a
lot
of
people
are
interested
in
it
Does
this
mean
they're
more
invested
in
seeing
Barack
Obama
win
the
election
than
in
being
profitable
Shouldn't
the
remaining
shareholders
in
the
company
be
concerned
about
this
attitude
Newsbusters
has
video
of
the
Bill
O'Reilly
show
the
Times
told
him
there's
an
ethical
problem
with
releasing
the
tape
Right
Newsbusters
has
the
email
address
of
the
owner
of
the
LA
Times
Sam
Zell
if
you'd
like
to
add
your
voice
to
the
many
who
are
demanding
a
release
of
the
video

Lots
of
email
complaints
that
the
site
is
running
slowly
this
morning
we
know
The
reason
our
traffic
has
been
very
high
since
yesterday
morning
As
we
write
there
are
more
than
6,000
people
online
and
we
had
over
180,000
page

yesterday
We're
in
discussions
with
our
host
to
upgrade
our
web
server
to
a
faster
machine
which
should
make
things
better
Until
then

there
Help
