INCOME
TAXES
MAN
Senator
Obama
you
have
promised
that
you
will
cut
taxes
for
90
of
America
But
you've
also
voted
to
allow
the
Bush
tax
cuts
to
expire
So
that
means
our
income
taxes
will
actually
go
up
Did
you
think
this
was
going
to
get
past
us
So
let's
make
this
real
simple
if
you
allow
the
Bush
tax
cuts
to
expire
how
many
taxpayers
would
pay
more
taxes
VIDEO
100
of
AMERICA
MAN
This
is
not
good
change
ANNOUNCER
What
happens
when
we
elect
a
President
who
raises
our
taxes
Please
America
let's
never
find
out
No
you
won't
get
to
keep
the
change
Well
what
happens
when
we
elect
a
President
and
Congress
pledged
to
raise
taxes
Recession
And
if
they
raise
them
enough
toss
in
some
protectionist
legislation
and
near
compulsory
unionization
for
good
measure
depression
And
what
exactly
does
share
the
wealth
mean
It
means
that
some
bureaucrat
whispers
to
some
politician
in
Washington
how
much
of
the
income
of
your
work
you'll
be
allowed
to
keep
Disagree
Well
sharing
under
the
Obama
plan
means
that
the
IRS
and
courts
will
have
you
tossed
in
chokey
Question
The
One
At
minimum
some
minor
state
official
will
be
trolling
through
your
records
looking
for
dirt
On
the
specifics
of
The
One's
tax
plan
Steven
Malanga
in
Real
Clear
Markets
notes
that
the
primary
question
is
where
does
wealth
originate
With
the
State
or
with
the
People
It's
the
people
Free
citizens
and
free
markets
produce
wealth
Governments
take
a
portion
of
that
wealth
in
taxes
for
some
legitimate
purposes
police
firefighters
national
defense
courts
and
some
illegitimate
bridges
to
nowhere
Fannie
Mae
Freddie
Mac
ACORN
etc
but
they
don't
create
wealth
Wealth
must
be
created
in
order
to
be
taxed
Ahhh
you
say
but
we
can
tax
the
rich
to
pay
for
benefits
to
the
poor
Well
who's
rich
Obama
has
been
claiming
that
his
tax
proposals
only
hit
those
making
over
250,000
But
wait
As
Jim
Geraghty
notes
Paul
Krugman
the
noted
Nobel
Laureate
and
Right
Wing
Extremist
columnist
for
the
NT
Times
says
that
The
One's
real
proposal
starts
hitting
at
about
182k
per
year
Keep
looking
for
this
number
to
continue
to
move
downward
Tigerhawk
and
the
New
York
Post
now
note
that
Joe
Biden
has
now
moved
the
bidding
down
to
150K
If
they
win
on
Nov
4
look
for
a
number
close
to
50K
on
Nov
5
Also
keep
in
mind
that
the
truly
rich
have
the
luxury
of
employing
the
best
tax
lawyers
available
to
keep
their
taxes
down
They
can
structure
their
income
streams
to
avoid
The
One's
grasp
Aspiring
middle
class
types
like
Joe
the
Plumber
Forget
about
it
Cesar
Conda
lays
out
the
gory
details
in
National
Review
Online
The
essence
of
the
Obama
the
Redistributor's
plan
hits
directly
at
the
twin
engines
of
economic
growth
and
prosperity
capital
formation
and
liquidity
and
individual
incentives
And
the
much
publicized
Obama
Middle
Class
Tax
Cuts
Transfer
payments
designed
specifically
not
to
allow
you
to
keep
more
of
what
you've
earned
or
saved
but
to
make
you
dependent
on
government
for
checks
Make
too
much
Say
get
a
smidgen
of
a
raise
to
make
over
40,000
You
could
lose
0.40
on
the
dollar
of
tax
credits
that
The
One
has
condescended
to
grant
The
Heritage
Foundation
provides
a
handy
side
by

comparison
of
the
McCain
and
Obama
tax
plans
here

are

Joe
the
Plumber
Must
Be

Well
we
now
have
a
start
on
the
perps
first
up
Helen
Jones-Kelley
Director
of
the
Ohio
Department
of
Job
and
Family
Services
Even
though
she's
close
to
a
maxed
out
Obama
supporter
I'm
sure
that
there
was
no
political
reason
for
running
records
on
a
man
with
the
temerity
to
question
The
One
And
Gov
Strickland
is
okey
dokey
with
this
abuse
of
power
Somehow
I
suspect
that
if
someone
was
running
unauthorized
checks
on
a
suddenly
important
Obama
supporter
he'd
be
less
supportive
After
all
it's
all
Joe's
fault
If
he
had
just
shut
up
and
realized
that
his
dream
of
providing
a
better
life
for
his
family
was
beyond
the
station
to
which
His
Obamaness
had
ordained
all
would
be
well
But
no
he
wanted
more
Too
uppity
for
his
Obamaness
so
now
le

supporters
like
Jones-Kelley
are
hunting

Assassination
Plot
Thanks
to
the
FBI
ATF
for
breaking
this
up
well
before
any
real
harm
occurred
Assassination
plots
even
inept
ones
shouldn't
be
funny
There's
always
a
couple
of
kooks
out
there
and
some
turn
out
to
be
dangerous
This
attempt
wasn't
likely
to
get
close
to
Senator
Obama
but
people
could
have
been
killed
in
the
run
up
to
the
attempt
so
it's
good
that
they'll
have
a
nice
long
stretch
in
Le
Hotel
Greybar
to
contemplate
their
sins
Hope
they
have
nice
roomates
Still
these
two
have
a
certain
something
Something
that
makes
this
very
difficult
to
take
seriously
though
the
FBI
has
to
and
because
they
bagged
the
kooks
before
any
real
violence
occurred
I
have
the
license
to
poke
fun
Daniel
Cowart
and
Paul
Schlesselman
seem
more
like
a
couple
of
circus
clowns
from
Central
Casting
than
assassins
The
entire
episode
sounds
more
like
a
scenario
for
a
Naked
Gun
movie
than
a
serious
attempt
As
far
as
the
plot
part
goes
not
much
plotting
actually
occurred
Reporting
from
Washington
Federal
authorities
in
Tennessee
announced
today
that
they
have
arrested
two
alleged
white
supremacists
in
an
alleged
plot
to
assassinate
Democratic
presidential
candidate
Barack
Obama
by
driving
their
vehicle
at
top
speed
and
firing
high-powered
rifles
at
him
from
their
car
windows
More
likely
to
be
dramatic
than
effective
but
still
well
within
the
powers
of
conception
for
a
couple
of
40
watt
bulbs
over
invested
in
video
games
and
more
beer
than
brains
It
gets
better
Both
individuals
stated
that
they
would
dress
in
all
white
tuxedos
and
wear
top
hats
during
the
assassination
attempt
Weaks
said
Both
individuals
further
stated
they
knew
they
would
and
were
willing
to
die
during
this
attempt
No
word
on
whether
or
not
they
also
intended
to
play

Even
more

is

to
the

ask

that's
pretty
much
guaranteed

Update
In
a

damned
moment
Bloomberg
has
gotten
City
Council
to
OK
his
efforts
to
buy
another
term
as
Mayor
He
won't
even

to

so

not

send
a

off
to
somewhere
to
bring

to

Ooooh
sorry
it's
not
technically
a
bribe
the

is
just

up
a
big
chunk
of
the
tab
Apparently
there's
no

in

No

I'd
say
that

having

As
noted
before
Mr
Indispensable
is
trying
to
change
the
law
to
guarantee
himself
another
term
as
Mayor
of
New
York
After
spending
80
million
to
buy
the
office
he's
now
turning
up
the
heat
on
groups
that
have
benefited
from
his
charity
in
the
past
Typical
local

thuggery
at
it's

Don't
worry
if
he
gets
this
through
he'll
be
back
for
term

This

Akron's
Scholarships
from
Sewers
Program
Two
quick
thoughts
1
If
this
passes
and
your
kids
decide
to
take
this
money
make
sure
that
they
take
a
lot
of
it
I
wouldn't
want
to
get
stuck
on
the
Akron
City
tax
rolls
for
30
years
if
I
only
needed
a
grand
or
two
for
school
2
Say
what
you
will
about
the
HSLDA
but
they
can
really
bring
out
the
barbarian
hordes
of
homeschoolers
when
needed
Got
an
email
blast
at
11:03
today
asking
people
to
contact
Akron
City
Council
over
the
blatantly
discriminatory
language
in
the
scholarship
proposal
At
4:38
received
a
follow
up
noting
that
the
Council
and
Mayor
had
thrown
in
the
towel
Dear
HSLDA
Members
and
Friends:Thank
you
for
your
calls
and
emails
to
the
Akron
City
Council
regarding
the
Sewers
for
scholarships
proposal
I
was
contacted
today
by
a
member
of
the
Akron
City
Council
homeschooling
father
Mike
Freeman
who
told
me
that
he
the
mayor
and
others
on
the
council
had
agreed
that
the
eligibility
requirements
for
the
Akron
scholarship
should
not
discriminate
against
homeschoolers
Councilman
Freeman
has
assured
HSLDA
that
changes
will
be
made
to
the
legislation
to
allow
homeschooled
students
to
be
eligible
for
the
scholarship
without
attending
an
Akron
public
school
It
appears
that
students
who
are
homeschooled
in
Akron
from
grades
1-12
and
meet
the
requirements
set
by
the
State
of
Ohio
will
be
eligible
for
a
full
scholarship
as
long
as
they
meet
certain
reasonable
college
or
university
homeschool
admission
requirements.We
appreciate
your
care
and
concern
I
don't
know
how
much
traffic
they
actually
generated
or
if
the
threat
of
political
pressure
from
the
relentlessly
polite
was
too
terrifying
to
face
or
if
this
was
in
the
works
already
but
I'm
certainly
proud
of
the
fact
that
TBMD
had
some
small
part
So
thanks
to
Mr
Freeman
and
others
for
doing
the
right
thing
I
think
that
it's
still
a
bad
idea
but
it's
now
less
bad
than
it
was
