Amazing

If
everyone

turned
out
in

What's
the
Price
of
Rose-Colored
Night
Vision
Goggles
The
wars
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
could
cost
the
Pentagon
some
of
their
wish
list
for
new
weapons
The
Government
Accountability
Office
has
found
costs
for
new
weapons
spiraling
out
of
control
and
competing
for
dollars
with
the
wars
From
the
Washington
Post
The
major
weapons
systems
being
developed
and
produced
by
the
Defense
Department
will
require
1.6
trillion
to
complete
and
335
billion
over
the
next
five
years
money
that
may
not
be
available
because
of
the
continuing
cost
of
military
operations
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
according
to
a
new
report
by
the
Government
Accountability
Office.The
GAO
found
some
weapons
were
pitched
with
unrealistic
price
tags
to
begin
with
sometimes
30
40
below
what
they
would
end
up
costing

Sen
Barack
Obama
D-IL
is
promising
a
political
convention
for
the
people
He's
breaking
with
the
tradition
of
accepting
the
Democratic
nomination
in
front
of
convention
floor
delegates
and
taking
his
speech
to
an
outdoor
venue
open
to
the
general
public
From
an
Obama
Campaign
email
On
Thursday
August
28th
he's
scheduled
to
formally
accept
the
Democratic
nomination
in
a
speech
at
the
convention
hall
in
front
of
the
assembled
delegates
Instead
Barack
will
leave
the
convention
hall
and
join
more
than
75,000
people
for
a
huge
free
open-air
event
where
he
will
deliver
his
acceptance
speech
to

OBAMA
It's
an
historic
night
Yet
circumstances
steal
Sen
Barack
Obama's
D-IL
thunder
He's
just
become
the
first
African-American
to
become
the
presumptive
nominee
of
a
major
party
That
should
be
a
big
deal
But
any
great
story
like
that
needs
a
hero
arc
That
Joseph
Campbell
construct
that
takes
a
character
from
humble
beginnings
through
a
life-changing
threshold
event
and
through
trials
and
tribulations
to
achieve
the
impossible
It
must
be
something
of
a
letdown
for
Sen
Obama
Because
beating
the
Republicans
this
year
in
this
political
environment
is
anything
but
impossible
What
with
a
Republican
administration
that
has
crippled
not
only
the
GOP
but
the
country
as
a
whole
There
is
little
for
Sen
Obama
to
overcome
at
this
point
The
1984
Meadow
Party
nominee
Bill
the
Cat
a
dead
cat
at
that
could
beat
the
Republican
nominee
Not
to
take
anything
away
from
Sen
Obama
He'd
be
a
hard
man
to
beat
in
tough
times
for
Democrats
He's
the
most
natural
politician
of
his
generation
my
generation
But
his
detractors
will
be
talking
as
soon
as
tomorrow
that
he
had
it
easy
he
had
no
real
challenge
he
won
by
default
Even
though
the
election
is
still
five
months
away
they'll
be
trying
to
soften
the
blow
of
defeat
in
November
before
summer
even
arrives
They'll
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
if
the
election
is
even
close
Hey
Close
only
counts
in
horseshoes
and
hand
grenades
And
if
Sen
Obama
is
running
at
a
time
when
the
GOP
is
weak
it
is
not
his
fault
It
is
his
time
It
is
the
failure
of
a
Republican
administration
after
eight
years
to
leave
this
country
with
a
war
that
has
no
victory
plan
and
an
economy
that
has
drained
Americans
of
hope
The
general
election
campaign
begins
tonight
Sen
John
McCain
R-AZ
has
a
lot
of
catching
up
to
do

from

The

President's
offhand
comment
was
not

he

that
it

made

Your

Already

increase

takes
1.3
billion

American

That's

checks
we're

The
package
was
worth
120
billion
But
when
it
passed
gas
was
3.00
a

Now
it's
4.00
All
that
