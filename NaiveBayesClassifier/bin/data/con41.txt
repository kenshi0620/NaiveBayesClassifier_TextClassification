Yes
I
took
a
long
blog
break
A
couple
of
readers/friends
have
missed
my
posts--thank
you
I
decided
to
take
a
long
break
and
perhaps
I
had
a
touch
of
blogstipation
due
to
some
health
problems
I've
been
suffering
under
and
also
because
the
Lib
Dems
have
taken
their
moonbattery
to
a
new
level--How
low
can
they
go?--and
most
of
it
was
so
disgusting
I
couldn't
stomach
even
talking
about
how
awful
they
were
behaving
I
mean
seriously
they've
politicized
all
levels
of
our
courts
in
their
attempts
to
decapitate
Republican
leadership
with
lawsuits
against
Tom
Delay
and
Scooter
Libby
Libby's
case
is
their
supposed
first
forée
in
an
attempt
to
impeach
President
Bush
and
they've
tried
to
imply
that
Sen
Bill
Frist
was
party
to
an
illicit
stock
deal
Betcha
thought
it
was
only
the
courts
in
Hitler's
Germany
and
Stalin's
USSR
that
were
used
to
destroy
and
disappear
their
political
enemies
So
I've
been
more
than
usually
fed
up--the
home
front
of
the
war
which
is
what
this
is
must
be
fought
and
won
even
though
it's
far
nastier
and
dirtier
than
the
other
front
in
Iraq
with
guns
and
bombs
And
after
blogging
the
WOT
for
3
and
1/2
years
without
a
vacation
I
just
had
to
take
a
break--deserved
I
think
But
don't
think
I
haven't
been
following
what's
been
happening
every
day
same
as
always
which
in
the
end
didn't
amount
to
much
of
a
break
really
But
a
got
a
little
more
sleep
and
it
was
fun
watching
the
Dims
implode
while
not
having
to
comment
about
how
pathetic
and
truly
stupid
their
efforts
are

Is
Paris
burning
Oui
Big
time
Rioting
Spreads
to
20
Towns
Around
Paris
Rampaging
youths
shot
at
police
and
firefighters
Thursday
after
burning
car
dealerships
and
public
buses
and
hurling
rocks
at
commuter
trains
as
eight
days
of
riots
over
poor
conditions
in
Paris-area
housing
projects
spread
to
20
towns
Nine
people
were
injured
in
Seine-Saint-Denis
and
315
cars
burned
across
the
Paris
area
officials
said
In
the
tough
northeastern
suburb
of
Aulnay-sous-Bois
youth
gangs
set
fire
to
a
Renault
car
dealership
and
burned
at
least
a
dozen
cars
a
supermarket
and
a
local
gymnasium
Traffic
was
halted
Thursday
morning
on
a
suburban
commuter
line
linking
Paris
to
Charles
de
Gaulle
airport
after
stone-throwing
rioters
attacked
two
trains
overnight
at
the
Le
Blanc-Mesnil
station
They
forced
a
conductor
from
one
train
and
broke
windows
the
SNCF
rail
authority
said
A
passenger
was
lightly
injured
by
broken
glass
What's
to
stop
these
louts
from
seizing
another
of
these
Metro
trains
and
taking
their
war
into
central
Paris
Rien
nothing.--Jen
The
violence
also
cast
doubt
on
the
success
of
France's
model
of
seeking
to
integrate
its
large
immigrant
community
its
Muslim
population
at
an
estimated
5
million
is
Western
Europe's
largest
by
playing
down
differences
between
ethnic
groups
Rather
than
feeling
embraced
as
full
and
equal
citizens
immigrants
and
their
French-born
children
complain
of
police
harassment
and
of
being
refused
jobs
housing
and
opportunities
This
is
also
attributable
to
France's
moribund
economy
with
its
10
unemployment
its
numerous
labor
laws
that
virtually
forbid
bosses
from
firing
current
jobholders
lock
in
wages
that
are
too
high
and
benefits
that
cut
into
any
profits
like
weeks
of
vacation
and
short
working
hours
There
is
no
incentive
anywhere
in
France
for
businesses
to
create
more
jobs
and
manufacturing
jobs
that
were
once
done
by
the
rioters
parents
and
grandparents
are
being
sent
out
to
China
It's
a
hellofa
mess
For
an
even
more
terrifying
and
first-hand
look
at
these
hotbeds
of
rage
the
Parisian
suburbs
of
violent
Muslim
youths
don't
miss
Theodore
Dalrymple's
piece
Barbarians
at
the
Gates
of
Paris
from
2002.--Jen
Right-wing
French
lawmaker
Philippe
de
Villiers
who
has
said
he
wants
to
stop
the
Islamization
of
France
told
RTL
radio
that
the
problem
stemmed
from
the
failure
of
a
policy
of
massive
and
uncontrolled
immigration
Has
the
dawn
of
the
Age
of
Eurabia

I
very
much
fear
that
it
has
Not
only
has
the
faltering
French
economy
contributed
to
this
state
of
affairs
but
there
are
other
wonderful
liberal
policies
like
the
eradication
of
the
death
penalty
and
the
weakening
of
all
other
criminal
punishments
as
well
as
the
emasculation
of
the
police
rendering
them
unable
or
unwilling
to
arrest
and
prosecute
lawbreakers
And
no-one
seems
to
have
guns
except
the
rioters
And
then
these
angry
young
men
have
radical
Islam
to
channel
and
direct
their
murderous
rage
to
where
Mecca
think
it
needs
to
go--to
kill
or
subdue
infidels
like
Jacques
Chirac
Gerard
Depardieu
and
Brigitte
Bardot
I
have
great
fondness
for
France
having
spent
some
considerable
time
there
but
I
see
no
end
in
sight
for
this
orgy
of
violence
now
that
it's
begun
It's
time
for
another
Charles
Martel
who
turned
back
the
Muslim
invasion
of
France
at
Tours
in
the
year
732
