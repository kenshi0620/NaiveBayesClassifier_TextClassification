Another
Obama
Relative
Turns
Up
This
time
it's
an
aunt
who
lives
in
a
run-down
area
of
Boston
Do
you
guys
think
the
MSM
will
get
their
mouths
off
of
Obama's
schlong
long
enough
to
ask
him
if
he's
going
to
help
out
his
relatives
Since
most
of
us
have
heard
the
interviews
on
Chicago
public
radio
when
Obama
pontificates
about
redistributive
change
does
that
mean
The
One
will
redistribute
his
own
money
to
help
his
family
I
doubt
it
It's
all
whitey's
fault

Two
People
Arrested
For
Hanging
Effigy
Of
Obama
I
knew
something
like
this
was
bound
to
happen
LEXINGTON
Ky
A
University
of
Kentucky
student
and
another
man
were
arrested
Thursday
accused
of
hanging
a
life-sized
likeness
of
Barack
Obama
from
a
tree
on
the
campus
The
incident
was
one
of
several
in
recent
weeks
involving
effigies
of
the
presidential
candidates
or
their
running
mates
No
charges
have
been
filed
in
four
other
cases
that
have
made
national
headlines
UK
Interim
Police
Chief
Joe
Monroe
said
the
men
expressed
remorse
for
a
stunt
that
had
gotten
out
of
hand
Arrested
were
Joe
Fischer
22
a
UK
student
and
Hunter
Bush
21
both
of
Lexington
Both
were
being
held
at
Fayette
County
Detention
Center
on
charges
of
disorderly
conduct
related
to
the
hanging
of
the
effigy
They
were
also
charged
with
burglary
and
theft
at
a
fraternity
house
where
police
said
the
materials
came
from
Meanwhile
I
have
yet
to
hear
of
anything
happening
to
those
Californicators
who
put
up
a
hanging
effigy
of
Sarah
Palin
for
Halloween
Supposedly
those
Californicators
did
not
commit
a
hate
crime
as
it
was
only
for
a
Halloween
display
snort
So
I'm
wondering
if
anything
would
have
happened
to
these
boys
in
Kentucky
if
they
had
only
put
up
their
display
a
few
days
earlier
I
think
they
still
would
have
gotten
arrested
After
all
no
one
is
allowed
to
criticize

ACORN
Fights
Back
These
left
wing
thugs
are
quite
something
Despite
an
FBI
investigation
for
voter
fraud
the
ACORN
people
are
acting
like
helpless
victims
I
just
wonder
if
they
really
believe
the
baloney
they
spout
ACORN
the
activist
group
accused
of
voter
fraud
in
15
states
went
on
the
offensive
today
accusing
Republicans
of
trying
to
suppress
turnout
on
Election
Day
Hugh
Alleyne
an
ACORN
board
member
told
reporters
at
Washington's
National
Press
Club
that
the
group
would
take
the
fight
to
its
critics
All
Americans
should
be
applauding
the
great
accomplishments
that
people
are
making
to
register
people
to
vote
said
Mr
Alleyne
Recently
we
have
seen
John
McCain
and
the
Republican
Party
attack
these
community
registration
drives
put
barriers
up
for
those
voters
challenged
election
officials
and
filed
lawsuits
in
an
effort
to
thwart
these
new
voters
So
we
should
be
applauding
them
for
signing
up
a
7
year
old
to
vote
Should
we
applaud
them
for
bribing
a
man
in
Ohio
to
register
72
times
Is
trying
toregister
Mickey
Mouse
to
vote
all
fine
and
dandy
What
about
trying
to
register
dead
people
in
Indiana
These
ACORN
people
have
a
lot
of
nerve
They
want
everyone
else
to
pay
more
taxes
to
support
the
poor
But
they
don't
pay
their
fair
share
of
taxes
I'm
surprised
they
haven't
been
sued

I
Know
Who
These
People
Will
Be
Voting
For
In
Washington
DC
criminals
have
the
right
to
vote
Those
booked
into
the
D.C
jail
get
voter
registration
information
when
they
arrive
and
when
they
leave
Since
March
about
2,400
inmates
have
received
registration
forms
Because
the
average
stay
is
28
days
most
of
the
inmates
have
long
since
been
released
But
about
100
inmates
requested
absentee
ballots
for
Tuesday's
election
and
about
half
were
approved
and
had
ballots
delivered
to
the
jail
We
try
to
educate
the
inmate
of
their
right
to
vote
said
Devon
Brown
director
of
the
D.C
Department
of
Corrections
Many
of
them
don't
know
they
can
vote

Confessions
Of
An
Obama
Blogger
Via
Hillbuzz
This
is
for
those
of
you
feeling
demoralized
every
time
you
read
about
Obama
being
ahead
in
the
polls
Read
what
it's
really
all
about
The
internal
campaign
idea
is
to
twist
distort
humiliate
and
finally
dispirit
you
We
pay
people
and
organize
people
to
go
to
all
the
online
sites
and
play
the
part
of
a
clinton
or
mccain
supporter
who
just
switched
our
support
for
obama
We
do
this
to
stifle
your
motivation
and
to
destroy
your
confidence
We
did
this
the
whole
primary
and
it
worked
Sprinkle
in
mass
vote
confusion
and
it
becomes
bewildering
Most
people
lose
patience
and
just
give
up
on
their
support
of
a
candidate
and
decide
to
just
block
out
tv
news
websites
etc
This
surprisingly
has
had
a
huge
suppressing
movement
and
vote
turnout
issues
Next
we
infiltrate
all
the
blogs
and
all
the
youtube
videos
and
overwhelm
the
voting
the
comments
etc
All
to
continue
this
appearance
of
overwhelming
world
support
People
makes
posts
to
the
effect
that
the
world
has
gone
mad
Thats
the
intention
To
make
you
feel
stressed
and
crazy
and
feel
like
the
world
is
ending
We
have
also
had
quite
a
hand
in
skewing
many
many
polls
some
we
couldn't
control
as
much
as
we
would
have
liked
But
many
we
have
spoiled
over
Just
enough
to
make
real
clear
politics
look
scarey
to
a
mccain
supporter
Its
worked
alough
the
goal
was
to
appear
13-15
points
ahead
see
the
results
have
been
working
People
tend
to
support
a
winner
go
with
the
flow
become
sheeple
The
polls
are
roughly
3-5
points
in
favor
of
Barack
Thats
due
to
our
inflation
of
the
polls
and
pulling
in
the
sheeple
Our
donors
are
the
same
people
who
finance
the
MSM
Their
interests
are
tied
Barack
then
tends
to
come
across
as
teflon
Nothing
sticks
And
trust
there
were
meetings
with
Fox
news
The
goal
was
to
blunt
them
as
much
as
possible
Watch
Bill
Oreilly
he
has
become
much
more
diplomatic
and
fair
and
balanced
and
soft
Its
because
he
wants
to
retain
the
1
spot
on
cable
news
and
to
do
that
he
has
to
have
access
to
the
Obama
campaign
and
we
worked
hard
at
stringing
him
a
long
and
keeping
him
soft
for
an
interview
swap
It
worked
and
now
he
is
anticipating
more
access
So
he
is
playing
it
still
soft
This
is
why
nothing
sticks

Obama
As
A
Trojan
Horse
Via
CitizenSlim
You
MUST
watch
this
video
that
shows
Obama
as
being
a
trojan
horse
who
wants
to
continue
the
radical
work
of
Bill
Ayres
and
Frank
Marshall
Davis
It's
almost
an
hour
long
and
some
of
the
information
on
it
is
old
But
it's
still
worth
watching
all
the
way
to
the
end

Quotes
From
The
Obama
Tape
The
LA
Times
Is
Suppressing
Blogger
Doug
Ross
has
a
contact
in
L.A
whom
he
believes
to
be
reliable
According
to
this
contact
the
reason
the
L.A
Times
won't
release
the
video
is
because
Obama
was
riling
up
the
audience
at
that
party
Saw
a
clip
from
the
tape
Reason
we
can't
release
it
is
because
statements
Obama
said
to
rile
audience
up
during
toast
He
congratulates
Khalidi
for
his
work
saying
Israel
has
no
God-given
right
to
occupy
Palestine
plus
there's
been
genocide
against
the
Palestinian
people
by
Israelis
It
would
be
really
controversial
if
it
got
out
That's
why
they
will
not
even
let
a
transcript
get
out
That
would
certainly
explain
it

A
federal
judge
in

has
ruled
that
counties
must
allow
homeless
voters
to
list
park
benches
and
other
locations
that
aren't

U.S

Judge
Edmund

also
ruled
that
provisional
ballots
can't
be
invalidated
because
of
poll
worker
errors
Monday's
ruling
resolved
the
final
two
pieces
of
a
settlement
between
the
Northeast
Ohio
Coalition
for
the
Homeless
and
Secretary
of
State
Jennifer
Brunner
The
coalition
agreed
to
drop
a
constitutional
challenge
to
Ohio's
voter
identification
law
until
after
the
Nov
4
election
In
return
Brunner
and
the
coalition
agreed
on
procedures
to
verify
provisional
ballots
across
all
Ohio
counties
The
coalition
was
concerned
that
unequal
treatment
of
provisional
ballots
would
disenfranchise
some
voters

Obama
Donor
Used
Government
Computers
To
Dig
Up
Dirt
On
Joe
The
Plumber
Barack
Hussein
Obama
has
not
even
become
President
yet
he's
having
his
Truth
Squad
in
Missouri
go
after
people
who
say
that
Obama's
not
a
Christian
He
tells
his
supporters
to
get
in
people's
faces
and
the
Obama
brownshirts
do
exactly
as
he
says
Now
we
have
an
Obama
supporter
named
Helen
Jones-Kelly
director
of
the
Ohio
Department
of
Job
and
Family
Services
who
admits
to
using
government
computers
to
dig
up
dirt
on
Joe
the
Plumber
Here's
a
picture
of
the
beotch
Helen
Jones-Kelly
director
of
the
Ohio
Department
of
Job
and
Family
Services
confirmed
today
that
she
OK'd
the
check
on
Samuel
Joseph
Wurzelbacher
following
the
Oct
15
presidential
debate
She
said
there
were
no
political
reasons
for
the
check
on
the
sudden
presidential
campaign
fixture
though
the
Support
Enforcement
Tracking
System
Amid
questions
from
the
media
and
others
about
Joe
the
Plumber
Jones-Kelley
said
she
approved
a
check
to
determine
if
he
was
current
on
any
ordered
child-support
payments
Such
information
was
not
and
cannot
be
publicly
shared
she
said
It
is
unclear
if
Wurzelbacher
is
involved
in
a
child-support
case
Reports
state
that
he
lives
alone
with
a
13-year-old
son
Our
practice
is
when
someone
is
thrust
quickly
into
the
public
spotlight
we
often
take
a
look
at
them
Jones-Kelley
said
citing
a
case
where
a
lottery
winner
was
found
to
owe
past-due
child
support
Our
practice
is
to
basically
look
at
what
is
coming
our
way
snip
At
least
four
state
computer
checks
on
Wurzelbacher
were
conducted
shortly
after
Republican
John
McCain
frequently
brought
up
Joe
the
Plumber
during
his
final
presidential
debate
with
Democrat
Barack
Obama
on
Oct
15
Yeah
right
It
turns
out
that
Ms
Kelly
has
donated
2,500
to
the
Obama
campaign
Joe
the
Plumber
is
now
thinking
of
suing
and
I
hope
he
goes
through
with
it
Also
a
Toledo
police
clerk
has
also
been
charged
with
snooping
on
Joe
