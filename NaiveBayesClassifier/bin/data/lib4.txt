The
Border
Wall
Must
Stop
This
week
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
DHS
is
expected
to
take
more
than
100
protesting
landowners
to
federal
court
in
an
effort
to
allow
government
surveyors
access
onto
their
land
DHS
is
preparing
to
build
a
wall
along
the
U.S
Mexico
border
but
many
landowners
along
the
border
especially
in
Texas
have
refused
to
allow
surveyors
onto
their
land
These
acts
are
more
than
acts
of
civil
disobedience
they
are
acts
of
survival
Although
many
of
these
landowners
despise
the
fact
that
a
government
imposed
wall
will
unjustly
separate
sister
communities
along
the
border
it
is
possible
that
most
landowners
simply
do
not
want
the
government
stripping
parts
of
their
land
Along
the
South
Texas
border
many
families
have
been
on
their
land
since
the
1700s
when
the
Spanish
government
provided
land
grants
to
people
living
along
the
Rio
Grande
Now
in
an
effort
to
protect
the
United
States
from
undocumented
immigrants
DHS
is
attempting
to
tear
away
portions
of
people's
homes
to
build
a
wall
that
stretches
from
California
to
Texas
The
arguments
used
by
activists
along
the
border
vary
as
much
as
the
people
making
the
arguments
Immigrant
activists
argue
that
a
wall
isn't
the
solution
Property
owners
argue
that
the
government
doesn't
have
the
right
to
take
their
land
The
Chamber
of
Commerce
argues
that
a
wall
will
affect
business
in
border
communities
But
the
argument
that
has
rarely
been
voiced
is
the
one
about
the
American
government's
history
of
bullying
South
Texas
a
community
that
most
Texans
don't
understand
much
less
politicos
in
Washington
D.C
Situated
at
the
southernmost
tip
of
the
U.S
the
Rio
Grande
Valley
is
as
far
South
as
you
can
go
along
the
U.S
Mexico
border
Hearing
people
switch
from
English
to
Spanish
in
any
given
situation
is
as
common
as
hearing
a
Seattleite
order
a
double
latte
South
Texas
is
a
place
rich
in
culture
where
the
4th
of
July
is
celebrated
by
parades
with
local
high
school
Mariachi
groups
performing
This
one
simple
celebration
illustrates
the
fact
that
these
communities
are
separated
only
by
administrative
borders
But
this
community
rich
in
dual
cultures
also
has
one
of
the
highest
rates
of
unemployment
with
more
sub-prime
mortgage
rates
than
anywhere
else
in
the
country
Another
incident
of
bullying
Perhaps
Or
perhaps
this
is
simply
indicative
an
unyielding
economy
But
why
then
are
there
high
incidences
of
children
living
in
colonias
suffering
from
hepatitis
Running
water
or
electricity
seems
fundamental
but
in
these
colonias
families
make
do
without
In
a
life
of
the
haves
and
the
have
nots
most
South
Texans
have
resigned
to
the
fact
that
they
are
forgotten
by
their
government
and
instead
rely
on
one
another
These
South
Texans
know
that
their
only
support
is
within
the
community
and
with
each
other
But
now
with
architectural
blue
prints
in
hand
the
government
remembers
that
the
South
Texans
are
there
They
are
walking
onto
their
lands
and
into
their
homes
with
billions
of
dollars
lining
their
pockets
but
that
money
is
not
to
help
ease
a
hungry
child's
cry
or
a
sick
child's
need
for
medicine
Instead
this
money
is
earmarked
for
a
border
wall
in
their
neighborhoods
and
backyards
DHS
insists
on
tearing
apart
these
communities
despite
the
many
repeated
protests
by
so
many
South
Texas
residents
Residents
feel
helpless
The
eyesore
of
a
wall
separating
sister
communities
seems
inevitable
unless
legal
challenges
are
successful
But
most
distressing
is
the
unanswered
question
of
what
this
wall
will
do
to
the
existing
communities
on
either
side
of
the
border
With
a
wall
separating
neighbors
it
will
slowly
begin
to
erode
the
support
systems
that
have
for
so
long
helped
the
ever-pervasive
population
of
have
nots
Right
now
it's
not
looking
good
The
attack
on
immigrants
and
communities
of
immigrants
must
stop
It's
our
border
let's
protect
it

The

beat
Coppell
to
become
state
champs
I'm
sure
Coppell
has
Mexican
kids
too
but
having
lived
in
both
regions
I
can
tell
you
that
South
Texas
lacks
in
formal
soccer
training
especially
compared
to
the
Dallas
area
Coppell
is
a
suburb
of
Dallas
Congratulations
