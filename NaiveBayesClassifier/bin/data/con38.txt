Takes
On
The
System
Part
2,038
What
the
hell
I'm
signing
a
bunch
of
paperwork
for
a
small
shack
of
a
house
that
I'm
buying
As
I
made
it
about
five
pages
into
stack
of
paper
that
I
have
to
go
through
I
noticed
something
funny
First
it
asked
whether
I
was
Hispanic
or
non-Hispanic
A
few
pages
later
it
has
a
Housing
Financial
Discrimination
Act
of
1977
notice
that
I
have
to
sign
In
that
form
it
goes
into
detail
about
how
it's
illegal
to
discriminate
against
me
based
on
race
What
the
hell
First
it
wants
to
know
if
I'm
Hispanic
I'm
guessing
that
is
because
they
want
Hispanic
people
to
have
houses
It
doesn't
ask
if
I'm
black
It
doesn't
ask
if
I'm
any
of
the
more
than
two-dozen
types
of
Asians
that
I've
come
across
in
my
life
It
sure
as
hell
doesn't
ask
if
I'm
white
It
just
wants
to
know
if
I'm
Hispanic
Based
on
the
fact
that
the
lenders
were
pressured
to
give
out
loans
based
on
race
and
that
many
of
those
people
who
couldn't
afford
homes
and
got
the
loans
solely
based
on
the
fact
that
they
were
not
white
how
does
this
make
any
sense
And
isn't
that
a
clear
violation
of
the
Housing
Financial
Discrimination
Act
of
1977
I'm
guessing
that
if
you
tell
someone
they
can't
afford
a
place
because
they're
a
certain
race
which
in
turn
would
be
illegal
based
on
that
form
the
same
goes
in
reverse
if
you
tell
someone
that
you'll
help
them
out
based
on
race
and
toss
all
the
non-Hispanics
to
the
curb
And
we
wonder
why
our
entire
financial
system
is
in
distress

Reinaldo
Arenas
Castro
and
Michael
Moore's
Sicko
A
true
history
of
a
Cuban
dissident
DonnaK
from
Moorewatch
asked
us
over
at
the
VO
if
we
wouldn't
mind
spreading
around
a
post
that
she
wrote
last
year
that
I
found
to
be
a
brilliantly
written
work
detailing
the
life
and
death
of
Reinaldo
Arenas
his
tortured
imprisonment
and
escape
from
Castro's
regime
and
a
revealing
look
at
shameless
liberal
apologists
for
that
regime
up
to
Michael
Moore
It's
lengthy
but
a
story
that
everyone
should
read
if
they
do
not
fully
understand
the
soul-destroying
horrors
of
Communism
Please
go
take
a
look

Just
an
FYI
Full
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
I
just
received
the
official
statistics
and
there
are
a
grand
total
of
8,108
registered
voters
in
the
seven
precincts
under
my
care
this
election
cycle
The
Registrar
says
that
the
expected
voter
turnout
will
be
roughly
75-80
of
those
with
about
33-35
being
early
voting
vote
by
mail
mail-in
and
early
electronic
voting
at
selected
sites
around
the
county
That
means
we
can
expect
3,200-3,500
voters
through
the
doors
Some
beneficial
changes
to
the
local
voters
there
will
be
six
election
officers
instead
of
the
previous
four
the
little
signs
that
used
to
sort
the
voters
by
last
name
A-L
M-Z
now
have
little
stands
that
make
them
easier
to
see
from
the
back
of
the
line
so
that
the
voter
need
not
waste
time
in
the
wrong
line
and
six
voting
booths
instead
of
five
plus
the
Accessible
Voting
Unit
electronic
touch-screen/bilingual
audio
voting
Please
don't
forget
to
get
out
and
vote
one
week
from
tomorrow
and
if
you
are
feeling
especially
helpful
contact
your
local
veteran's
associations
to
see
if
any
vets
need
a
ride
to
the
polls
Also
this
is
the
last
warning
you
will
get
about
the
contest
which
ends
tomorrow
night
at
8pm
Pacific

See
the
post
immediately
below
this
one
and
add
this
to
the
post
I
wrote
a
few
days
ago
It
leads
me
to
as
a
question
of
any
person
who
is
thinking
of
voting
for
Obama
or
rather
not
voting
for
McCain
at
this
point
If
someone
wanted
to
date
your
daughter
or
rent
a
house
from
you
or
do
work
for
you
personally
or
as
an
employee
and
you
even
suspected
that
he
had
the
relationships
associates
and
past
that
Barack
Obama
has
been
demonstrated
to
have
would
you
ever
say
Yes
to
that
person
And
if
there
would
be
any
doubt
in
your
mind
about
someone
like
that
why
in
the
hell
would
you
put
them
into
the
Presidency
of
the
United
States
Seriously....why
And
if
there
are
any
readers
of
Drumwaster's
Rants
that
believe
that
Obama
should
be
President
please
put
why
in
the

of
this

The
Fairness
Doctrine
nonsense
Dems
have
a
plan
for
legislation
after
the
elections
especially
if
Obama
happens
to
win
called
the
Fairness
Doctrine
This
is
a
plan
to
force
the
radio
stations
who
have
conservatives
on
talk
radio
programs
to
present
opposing
points
of
view
by
requiring
equal
amounts
of
time
for
Democrats
and
Republicans
to
espouse
their
points
of
view
One
problem
though
I
notice
All
of
their
efforts
seem
to
be
directed
at
one
segment
of
the
POV-espousing
broadcast
spectrum
talk
radio
They
are
not
interested
in
correcting
to
the
extreme
imbalance
in
editorial
bias
on
any
of
the
broadcast
networks
ABC
CBS
NBC
the
Cable
News
channels
CNN
MSNBC
all
of
them
other
than
FoxNews
I
note
the
print
media
NYT
LAT
WaPo
etc
nor
the
overwhelming
majority
of
so-called
celebrity
endorsements
Apparently
those
are
protected
speech
under
such
a
Fairness
plan
But
now
they
are
arguing
for
Net
Neutrality
doing
the
same
thing
to
the
Internet
Apparently
there
are
not
enough
people
supporting
the
liberal
point
of
view
on
the
web
Snicker
guffaw
chortle
I
have
no
problem
with
a
fairness
doctrine
but
it
must
apply
to
all
aspects
of
media
newspapers
television
networks
cable
news
programs
and
even
talk
radio
That
means
that
ABCNNBCBS
must
give
Republicans
equal
opportunity
to
refute
the
erroneous
claims
being
advanced
MSNBC
must
give
Ann
Coulter
her
own
hour-long
program
to
counter
Keith
Olbermann
and
Air
America
has
to
give
time
to
Mark
Levin
or
Rush
Limbaugh
The
New
York
Times
must
run
exactly
as
many
conservative
columnists
as
liberal
ones
Only
celebrities
that
can
provide
another
celebrity
with
an
equivalent
Q-rating
who
disagrees
with
him/her
will
be
allowed
to
comment
on
political
events
candidates
or
issues
and
with
exactly
the
same
amount
of
time
to
each
You
want
fairness
on
the
Internet
you
liberal
asshats
You
want
to
force
me
to
provide
a
sidebar
with
posts
from
someone
at
the
other
end
of
the
political
spectrum
Then
you
pay
half
my
bills
and
provide
half
the
prize
money
for
the
contests
and
I'll
think
about
it
But
as
long
as
anybody
with
Internet
access
can
afford
blog
space
especially
considering
the
fact
that
it
is
FREE
for
anyone
who
knows
what
to
look
for
this
is
MY
demesnes
and
I
do
not
suffer
fools
gladly
You
want
fairness
then
we
will
have
fairness
but
across
the
board
not
just
in
the
one
or
two
areas
where
you
don't
already
have
an
overwhelming
majority
Either
that
or
be
prepared
to
duck
and
cover
because
I
won't
stand
for
it
And
I'm
not
the
only
one

So
exactly
what
DOES
a
Vice
President
do
Liberals
are
poking
fun
at
Palin
because
when
she
was
asked
what
her
job
would
be
as
Vice
President
She
replied
that
the
Vice
President
runs
the
Senate
OMGZ!!!!one!eleventy
Um
I've
got
news
for
you
knuckleheads
From
the
proverbial
horse's
mouth
comes
the
only
times
the
Vice
President
is
mentioned
in
the
Constitution
Article
1
Section
3
The
Vice
President
of
the
United
States
shall
be
President
of
the
Senate
but
shall
have
no
Vote
unless
they
be
equally
divided
The
Senate
shall
chuse
their
other
Officers
and
also
a
President
pro
tempore
in
the
absence
of
the
Vice
President
or
when
he
shall
exercise
the
Office
of
President
of
the
United
States
Article
2
Section
1
The
executive
Power
shall
be
vested
in
a
President
of
the
United
States
of
America
He
shall
hold
his
Office
during
the
Term
of
four
Years
and
together
with
the
Vice-President
chosen
for
the
same
Term
Article
2
Section
4
The
President
Vice
President
and
all
civil
Officers
of
the
United
States
shall
be
removed
from
Office
on
Impeachment
for
and
Conviction
of
Treason
Bribery
or
other
high
Crimes
and
Misdemeanors
The
Vice
President
is
also
mentioned
in
the
various
Amendments
Amendment
12
changed
the
method
of
electing
the
POTUS
and
VPOTUS
and
Amendment
25
determines
the
line
and
method
of
Presidential
succession
All
that
boils
down
to
is
this
the
Vice-President
of
the
United
States
has
precisely
two
count
em
two
defined
duties
to
preside
over
the
Senate
and
to
outlive
the
President
It
would
be
somewhat
crass
to
mention
the
automatic
promotion
part
of
the
job
so
the
only
other
part
of
the
job
is
to
PRESIDE
OVER
THE
SENATE
Most
VPs
leave
the
job
to
the
ceremonially-chosen
President
Pro
Tempore
usually
the
senior
Senator
from
the
majority
party
and
the
majority
leader
has
pretty
much
free
rein
but
if
the
VPOTUS
decides
to
assume
his
well
actually
her
official
duties
there
is
nothing
that
anyone
can
say
about
it
and
the
presiding
officer
has
a
great
deal
of
parliamentary
authority
such
as
to
decide
who
has
the
floor
and
to
force
a
great
deal
of
delay
to
legislation
she
might
be
opposed
to
etc
The
Constitution
is
quite
explicit
and
the
courts
would
probably
refuse
to
hear
a
challenge
regarding
the
exercise
of
political
power
So
unless
someone
on
the
other
side
of
this
waste
of
breath
of
an
argument
cares
to
come
up
with
something
more
authoritative
as
to
the
duties
of
the
Vice
President
that's
gonna
have
to
do

OK…here
it
is
I
have
been
poking
around
not
posting
obviously
but
poking
the
Rants
for
a
while
with
an
occasional
liveblog
or
pithy
comment
Frankly
as
noted
before
this
election
campaign
hasn't
been
really
one
that
has
excited
me
like
in
2004
Then
we
had
GWB
a
sitting
PResident
and
faulted
Republican
with
the
correct
ideas
on
the
War
on
Terror
and
John
Kerry
an
ultra-liberal
who
was
as
transparent
as
plastic
wrap
and
had
fatally
faulted
ideas
on
foreign
policy
Then
however
Kerry
wasn't
good
enough
on
the
mic
a
little
pro
wrestling
lingo
to
hide
his
socialism
and
post-nationalism
It
leaked
out
of
him
at
his
Convention
from
his
past
and
in
his
campaign
It
was
clear
that
the
man
didn't
view
America
as
the
bastion
of
liberty
and
freedom
and
that
he
saw
us
as
a
flawed
and
angry
society
that
needed
coaching
from
the
POTUS
pulpit
We
were
bigots
and
we
were
warlike
and
he
was
the
bourgeois
all-knowing
and
elitist
leader
that
would
educate
us
on
our
flaws
52
of
voters
rejected
that
because
9-11
was
still
fresh
in
our
minds
the
Iraq
war
was
a
lot
more
intense
and
intensely
reported
at
that
time
and
we
weren't
going
to
trust
the
moment
to
a
guy
that
went
in
front
of
Congress
and
badmouthed
the
troops
told
untruths
about
his
past
and
was
by
choice
totally
disconnected
from
Americans
Bush
through
all
his
spending
and
alienation
of
the
fiscal
conservatives
and
libertarian-leaning
independents
was
chosen
because
he
was
at
least
right
about
who
the
enemy
was
Regret
your
vote
or
not
Kerry
was
a
fatally-unelectable
candidate
Now
however
two
metrics
have
changed
The
economy
has
turned
south
and
the
media
has
made
it
a
point
to
affect
this
election
These
two
things
have
combined
to
take
someone
more
liberal
than
Kerry
and
make
him
more
viable
Obama
is
more
leftist
less
compromising
more
detached
from
everyday
Americans
and
less
patriotic
than
Kerry
His
only
two
differences
save
his
age
are
his
ability
to
communicate
and
his
color
However
the
two
situations
that
I
mentioned
above
have
changed
the
dynamics
Someone
with
Obama's
political
stances
should
have
been
laughed
out
of
the
primaries
I
for
one
would
never
vote
for
a
candidate
that
regularly
attended
a
racist
church
had
been
supported
and
worked
for
and
with
someone
that
had
tried
to
foment
revolution
in
the
United
States
had
married
an
obviously
racist
wife
and
had
supported
abortion-on-demand
At
best
someone
like
that
with
that
kind
of
recent
history
with
no
real
experience
at
running
anything
would
have
been
out
of
the
process
on
Super
Tuesday
no
matter
their
political
leanings
America
tends
to
reject
those
that
far
to
one
side
or
the
other
of
the
political
spectrum
However
the
media
having
been
embarrassed
by
the
Swift
Boat
Veterans
Bush
himself
and
the
new
media
ask
Dan
Rather
about
Little
Green
Footballs
came
to
a
collective
personal
decision
that
whoever
they
saw
as
viable
they
would
promote
As
the
primaries
go
we
saw
the
normal
patterns
evolve....those
that
ran
in
the
middle
slow-started
those
on
the
fringes
ran
better
and
Obama
started
getting
traction
based
on
that
Don't
assume
that
it
was
because
he
was
that
damned
good
or
anything
because
it
wasn't
He
was
a
vote
against
Hillary
Clinton
who
had
the
sense
to
know
that
the
Kos
Kids
and
the
far
leftists
would
not
be
good
for
a
national
candidate
Once
he
started
winning
huge
in
the
states
with
high
minorities
he
became
the
protest
vote
and
the
darling
of
white
liberal
elitists
the
media
and
academia
As
Biden
said
at
the
time
he
spoke
well
and
was
intelligent
and
that
made
him
safe
It
made
him
the
anti-Jesse
Jackson...the
leftist
black
politician
that
liberal
whites
could
vote
for
and
display
their
vote
as
proof
of
their
open-mindedness
So
the
media
turned
on
Hillary.....it
was
clear
that
they
had
made
their
decision
as
the
primary
went
on
and
the
delegates
started
committing
With
the
media
fitting
into
two
of
the
three
main
bodies
that
had
voracious
support
for
Obama
the
coverage
became
two-fold
they
started
reporting
everything
that
would
help
Obama
and
nothing
that
would
hurt
him
William
Wright
was
summarily
dropped
Obama
started
getting
overwhelmingly
positive
coverage
The
pattern
though
in
a
bit
of
flux
has
remained
constantly
positive
for
Obama
with
71
being
positive
or
neutral
since
the
Convention
while
McCain's
positive
and
neutral
coverage
has
been
under
43
More
telling
is
the
negative
coverage
with
29
being
negative
for
Obama
and
57
negative
for
McCain
The
media
is
not
reporting
negative
stories
about
Barack
Obama
Ask
Stanley
Kurtz
all
about
that
And
look
at
this
study
being
reported
today
in
the
New
York
Times
In
addition
they
have
gone
after
the
only
threat
to
the
cult
of
personality
they
have
established
around
Obama.....Sarah
Palin
Her
coverage
has
bounced
around
going
from
positive
in
the
week
after
her
selection
to
resoundingly
negative
since
She
is
special
bright
conservative
and
has
knit
together
the
conservative
base.......in
other
words
she
has
become
a
threat
Lawyers
were
sent
to
plumb
around
in
her
personal
life
Her
personal
e-mail
account
was
hacked
by
the
son
of
a
Tennessee
Democrat
politician
While
Obama
casually
forgot
to
release
medical
records
and
coursework
from
college
people
were
getting
pictures
of
Palin
from
her
childhood
and
people's
divorce
records
were
being
unsealed
to
see
if
she
had
slept
with
someone
causing
marital
discord
It
was
obvious
she
was
seen
as
a
threat
to
his
ascension
and
she
was
treated
as
such
With
the
economy
turning
sour
the
media
had
another
tool
When
McCain
demonstrated
dedication
to
solving
the
problem
by
suspending
his
campaign
a
politically
foolish
move
but
a
wholly
honest
one
and
bespeaking
his
dedication
to
his
principles
Obama
and
the
press
framed
it
as
a
political
stunt
echoing
Harry
Reid's
words....McCain
was
blasted
for
wanting
to
help
in
the
only
way
he
could
Obama
did
nothing
except
tell
people
to
call
him
if
he
were
needed
then
went
to
DC
and
participated
in
a
meeting
that
ended
up
being
nothing
but
pro-Obama
political
theater
by
the
Democrats
McCain
did
his
best
to
avoid
the
political
theater
because
it
wouldn't
help
the
situation
but
Obama
and
the
press
jumped
on
it
to
gain
political
points
The
Republicans
knew
that
they
had
an
ally
in
McCain
coming
so
they
tried
to
propose
a
different
plan
but
the
media
played
it
like
McCain
had
destroyed
the
entire
process
just
by
coming
Of
course
they
also
said
that
Obama
was
the
chosen
leader
in
the
meetings
with
the
President
And
on
and
on
You
have
heard
the
news
and
the
debates
Obama
has
come
out
and
described
the
socialist
roots
and
underpinnings
of
his
economic
plan...'spread
the
wealth
indeed
He
has
come
out
and
said
that
knowledge
of
the
Constitution
isn't
the
most
important
metric
in
choosing
a
judge
for
the
Supreme
Court
but
empathy
is
He
has
called
for
cuts
in
defense
spending
in
a
time
of
war
and
tax
rebates
for
people
that
do
not
pay
federal
taxes
No
noise
from
the
MSM
no
reactions
to
what
he
has
done
and
the
stories
of
his
past
that
have
been
played
have
been
shown
commented
on
for
a
matter
of
minutes
then
dropped
It
is
what
it
is
According
to
Real
Clear
Politics
with
10
days
left
the
polls
show
Obama
has
a
7.5
point
lead
in
the
popular
vote
and
a
sizable
if
not
commanding
lead
in
the
Electoral
College
He
has
raised
over
half
a
billion
dollars
having
eschewed
an
earlier
promise
to
use
public
funds
and
demonstrate
a
dedication
to
campaign
finance
reform
He
is
poised
to
win
the
election
make
history
and
bring
a
rather
radicalized
worldview
to
the
White
House
And
I
ask
you
not
to
let
that
happen
Why
Because
of
who
Obama
is
Obama
is
John
Kerry
in
slick
packaging
He
is
a
polished
verbose
and
talented
leftist
politician
that
has
proven
that
he
holds
a
radical
view
of
the
United
States
From
spending
20
years
in
a
racist
Black
Theology
church
to
supporting
the
worldview
of
a
man
who
is
proud
of
his
terrorist
past
who
voted
to
withhold
life-saving
treatment
for
babies
born
via
botched
abortion
He's
secretive
about
his
past
dismissive
of
people
like
you
and
I
remember
his
comments
about
Bibles
and
guns
and
utterly
willing
to
lie
fabricate
use
race
sex
and
all
the
hot-points
he
can
find
to
promote
himself
He
has
little
experience...in
his
Senatorial
career
he
has
had
an
opportunity
to
vote
587
times
and
has
skipped
voting
239
times
or
41
of
the
time
He
has
a
markedly
leftist
slant
in
his
voting
record
The
proof
of
who
he
is
resides
in
what
he
has
done
hot
how
he
packages
himself
or
in
what
he
says
That's
why
I
am
asking
those
of
you
who
are
thinking
of
sitting
this
one
out
or
voting
Libertarian
to
vote
for
McCain
He
isn't
the
guy
I
would
have
hoped
for
I
wanted
Fred
Thompson
to
be
sure
There
must
have
been
a
hundred
other
people
I
would
have
wanted
in
this
campaign
other
than
McCain
but
there
he
is
He's
the
only
person
in
the
running
that
has
a
chance
of
beating
Obama
Bob
Barr
isn't
going
to
do
it
No-one
else
has
a
snowball's
chance
in
hell
except
John
McCain
However
for
his
political
differences
with
me
he
is
a
better
man
a
more
conservative
candidate
and
a
finer
choice
for
the
position
He
has
experience
he
has
demonstrated
his
dedication
to
his
country
over
his
party
and
even
his
own
desires
and
has
put
together
a
platform
that
is
a
better
choice
for
our
country
and
our
children
than
the
one
Obama
has
He
has
come
to
the
right
on
several
issues
shown
a
few
right-leaning
bona
fides
and
chosen
a
real
winner
for
his
running
mate
He
has
no
agenda
for
redistributing
wealth
and
most
importantly
has
the
correct
thoughts
and
ideas
where
the
defense
of
this
country
is
concerned
McCain
isn't
pretty
vogue
or
cool
He's
a
physically
damaged
man
who
is
not
a
good
speech
reader
and
is
a
bit
long
in
the
tooth
But
in
this
election
we
aren't
voting
for
wrapping
paper
or
a
reality
show.....we're
voting
for
a
president
in
a
time
of
war
and
economic
challenge
and
Barack
Obama
is
not
the
person
to
put
in
that
position
especially
with
the
leftists
in
Congress
preparing
to
reinforce
their
majority
As
I
have
said
I
will
vote
for
the
man
that
agrees
with
me
65
of
the
time
over
the
man
who
agrees
with
me
10
of
the
time
I
don't
care
about
his
speaking
acumen
his
race
his
looks.....what
makes
Obama
is
himself
and
what
he
has
made
is
someone
that
I
do
not
believe
is
either
ready
or
proper
to
be
a
President
of
the
United
States
But
John
McCain
is

Palin's
Malignment
Syndrome
Trust
me
this
one
has
more
legs
than
BDS
Okay
I
posted
over
at
our
site
today
a
couple
of
things
The
first
was
a
pat
on
the
back
but
the
second
I'm
going
to
follow
for
a
minute
I
commented
on
it
for
a
second
and
I
wanted
to
elaborate
on
our
good
friend's
site
for
a
second
Why
does
everyone
hate
Palin
now
I
was
holed
up
in
my
room
with
the
flu
today
I
literally
tracked
that
story
along
with
the
KU
story
from
MSNBC
on
TV
to
a
story
about
her
being
a
liability
on
yahoo
The
talk
on
the
pundit
shows
is
that
Palin
is
actually
the
reason
not
to
vote
for
McCain
now
and
that
this
shopping
spree
will
doom
her
career
and
she's
now
not
allowed
to
be
a
hockey
mom
Seriously
this
is
the
year
unbiased
media
was
shot
dead
karate
chopped
to
death
and
replaced
by
a
Matrix
Sentinel
who
parrots
Barack
Obama's
campaign
We
have
BDS
ODS
and
now
we
need
to
add
to
it
PDS
I'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
has
happened
twice
to
a
female
candidate
mind
you
Shillary
was
the
first
that
the
loving
left
tarred
and
feathered
and
now
Palin
is
the
objectification
heh
heh
of
infection
Seriously
how
did
this
woman
become
such
a
target
she
was
this
harmless
Governor
from
Alaska
who
botched
an
interview
and
now
we're
calling
her
a
liar
based
on
her
wardrobe
Most
of
us
are
dudes
here
and
let's
be
honest
you
know
that
your
woman
needs
her
clothes
and
shoes
this
is
no
freakin
secret
and
nothing
new
This
would
be
a
discussion
in
any
hockey
mom's
home
the
one
who
is
running
for
VP
office
not
withstanding
I'd
also
like
to
add
that
the
left
has
a
serious
penchant
for
propping
up
the
most
weak
leaders
attacking
who
they
consider
the
most
lame
and
avoiding
the
real
challenge
which
is
John
McCain
himself
For
Christs
sake
John
McCain
is
the
one
trying
to
be
the
president
not
Sarah
Palin
yet
anytime
this
woman
tries
to
show
her
face
in
public
the
left
smears
her
in
the
most
pathetic
of
ways
As
I
stated
before
this
is
not
the
first
time
they
have
engaged
in
this
predatory
activity
they
first
stalked
and
poached
Shillary
in
favor
of
Barack
a
move
in
which
Barack
looked
even
more
pathetic
than
Hillary
Now
having
learned
form
the
experience
the
left
is
determined
to
destroy
the
hopes
of
a
woman
in
office
with
an
R
in
next
to
her
name
in
favor
of
a
weak
and
inexperienced
candidate
who
happens
to
carry
the
badge
that
pays
The
all
knowing
peaceful
good
economy
D
Ah
the
left
A
really
loving
bunch
aren't
they
h/t
Thrill
I
couldn't
have
made
up
PMS
on
my
own
