In
Tanzania
Indepedent
Journalists
Show
Resolve
We
have
reported
about
Tanzania's
independent
media
standing
up
to
arbitrary
media
black-outs
Journalists
march
in
Dar
el
Salaam
One
would
think
that
given
the
odds
against
them
they
would
waiver
Think
again
These
people
have
steel
in
their
backbones
Let's
have
it
from
Dar
el
Salaam's
The
Guardian
a
name
that
is
not
only
for
show
Editors
from
different
media
houses
yesterday
staged
a
peaceful
demonstration
to
register
their
opposition
to
a
government
ban
on
MwanaHALISI
weekly
tabloid
The
peaceful
march
that
started
at
Lugoda
Street
Gerezani
near
Business
Times
offices
and
headed
to
the
information
ministry
offices
along
Samora
Avenue
in
Dar
es
Salaam
was
also
supported
by
activists
from
other
organisations
The
editors
marched
with
sealed
mouths
being
a
mark
of
silencing
the
media
and
suppressing
its
freedom
They
also
displayed
placards
that
carried
varied
messages
all
opposed
to
the
banning
of
MwanaHALISI
Some
of
the
placards
read
as
follows
The
government
should
not
temper
with
press
freedom
Mwanahalisi
is
banned
but
the
corrupt
leaders
are
still
in
office
Who
revealed
the
EPA
Richmond
and
UVCCM
scandals
We
want
MwanaHalisi
back
We
shall
continue
writing
until
the
end
of
this
world
The
newspapers
Act
of
1976
should
be
abandoned
MwanaHaLISI
is
the
ear
mouth
and
eye
of
every
Tanzanian
We
are
not
used
to
good
press
freedom
news
But
Tanzania's
independent
media
keep
making
us
all
proud

Europeana
A
Welcome
Addition
to
Open-Ended
Knowledge
Most
of
the
posts
on
this
blog
unfortunately
have
to
do
with
restriction
of
knowledge
Very
rarely
do
we
encounter
the
opportunity
to
write
about
initiatives
that
aim
at
opening
up
the
gates
of
knowledge
This
is
one
of
them
The
European
Union
is
about
to
launch
a
digital
encyclopedia
of
Europe's
cultural
heritage
and
they
are
already
calling
it
Europeana
Europeana
is
an
ambitious
project
to
digitize
large
portions
of
the
continent's
national
libraries
and
put
as
much
of
European
civilization
as
possible
books
maps
paintings
photos
films
online
for
free
The
Web
site
at
the
moment
just
has
a
demonstration
tour
But
Viviane
Reding
EU
Commissioner
for
Information
Society
and
Media
has
promised
to
have
two
million
digitized
objects
available
for
full
public
browsing
in
English
German
and
French
by
November
20
Europeana
will
let
a
reader
start
say
with
an
image
of
the
Mona
Lisa
Then
it
will
encourage
a
stroll
through
related
paintings
music
books
or
other
artifacts
using
data
tags
Leonardo
da
Vinci
portraits
Italy
even
a
color
or
a
timeline
of
European
history
The
project
ostensibly
presents
itself
as
a
competitor
to
the
Google
Library
Project
which
since
2004
has
already
scanned
some
10
million
books
and
other
pieces
We
love
to
hear
this
kind
of
competition
is
taking
place
What
project
can
make
the
most
knowledge
available
to
the
most
people
for
free
and
the
fastest
Get
set
ready
go

A
Insulting
Lack
of
Sense
of
Humor
Countries
whose
leaders
are
still
considered
protected
by
divine
intervention
really
need
to
get
a
healthy
load
of
sense
of
humor
Take
the
Moroccan
Crown
for
example
one
of
the
world's
most
entrenched
unaccountable
monarchies
who
is
barricaded
behind
a
battery
of
ancient
laws
insult
laws
that
is
designed
to
keep
the
public
away
from
its
dealings
EPA
photo
This
medieval
approach
to
government
has
taken
a
very
heavy
toll
on
Morocco's
development
and
international
standing
Yet
the
king
of
Morocco
Mohamed
VI
above
and
his
very
wealthy
entourage
insist
on
clinging
on
to
these
laws
and
their
abusive
punishments
to
keep
99.99
percent
of
Moroccans
in
the
dark
about
their
government's
business
Until
something
very
harmless
very
infantile
and
very
embarrassing
hits
the
international
news
Then
the
curtains
covering
this
edifice
of
deception
are
blown
away
Here
is
from
the
BBC
A
Moroccan
schoolboy
aged
18
has
been
jailed
for
insulting
the
king
after
replacing
the
monarch's
name
with
that
of
his
favourite
football
club
He
altered
the
phrase
God
The
Nation
The
King
on
the
school
blackboard
to
read
God
The
Nation
Barcelona
FC
Barcelona
says
it
has
appointed
a
lawyer
to
look
into
whether
they
can
help
the
boy
within
the
framework
of
Moroccan
law
In
several
cases
young
men
have
been
jailed
for
insulting
the
royal
family
The
BBC's
James
Copnall
in
Rabat
says
it
is
not
completely
clear
whether
the
court
felt
the
remarks
about
the
football
club
or
other
apparent
insults
to
the
king
were
the
problem
The
Moroccan
justice
ministry
has
not
commented
on
the
case
So
far
the
score
is
Sense
of
Humor

You've
got
to

Global
Network
Initiative
Launched
As
we
anticipated
yesterday
the
Global
Network
Initiative
was
launched
today
with
the
backing
of
a
very
diverse
alliance
of
both
corporate
and
civil
society
organizations
including
the
World
Press
Freedom
Committee
Mark
Bench
Executive
Director
of
the
World
Press
Freedom
Committee
had
this
to
say
about
the
launching
of
the
initiative
As
the
world
increasingly
obtains
its
news
and
information
from
a
press
that
is
making
a
progressively
larger
or
even
exclusive
use
of
the
Internet
old
problems
must
be
attacked
in
new
ways
Longstanding
censorship
issues
such
as
laws
imposing
criminal
penalties
for
alleged
defamation
or
even
truthful
statements
that
insult
a
head
of
state
or
other
government
officials
become
even
more
damaging
when
the
last
bastion
for
the
wrongfully
persecuted
protecting
oneself
under
the
cloak
of
anonymity
that
the
Internet
may
provide
cannot
be
fully
utilized
These
principles
assist
the
press
and
any
other
citizens
who
seek
to
inform
and
influence
others
by
ensuring
a
strong
united
front
against
the
government
persecution
and
censorship
that
is
often
effected
against
the
lone
dissenter
Here
is
the
official
announcement
In
an
effort
to
protect
and
advance
the
human
rights
of
freedom
of
expression
and
privacy
a
diverse
coalition
of
leading
information
and
communications
companies
major
human
rights
organizations
academics
investors
and
technology
leaders
today
launched
the
Global
Network
Initiative
From
the
Americas
to
Europe
to
the
Middle
East
to
Africa
and
Asia
companies
in
the
information
and
communications
industries
face
increasing
government
pressure
to
comply
with
domestic
laws
and
policies
that
require
censorship
and
disclosure
of
personal
information
in
ways
that
conflict
with
internationally
recognized
human
rights
laws
and
standards
The
Initiative
is
founded
upon
new
Principles
on
Freedom
of
Expression
and
Privacy
supported
by
specific
implementation
commitments
and
a
framework
for
accountability
and
learning
that
provide
a
systematic
approach
for
companies
NGOs
investors
academics
and
others
to
work
together
in
resisting
efforts
by
governments
that
seek
to
enlist
companies
in
acts
of
censorship
and
surveillance
that
violate
international
standards
The
Initiative
is
being
launched
in
the
60th
Anniversary
year
of
the
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
and
is
founded
upon
the
internationally
recognized
human
rights
for
freedom
of
expression
and
privacy
set
out
in
the
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
the
International
Covenant
on
Civil
and
Political
Rights
and
the
International
Covenant
on
Economic
Social
and
Cultural
Rights
The
Principles
and
accompanying
Implementation
Guidelines
require
significant
new
commitments
from
participating
companies
including
establishing
greater
transparency
with
users
assessing
human
rights
risk
requesting
the
legal
rationale
for
government
actions
and
policies
training
employees
challenging
human
rights
violations
and
providing
whistle-blowing
mechanisms
through
which
violations
of
the
Principles
can
be
reported
The
participants
recognize
that
responsible
company
actions
alone
cannot
guarantee
that
human
rights
are
not
violated
Instead
governments
have
the
ultimate
responsibility
to
ensure
that
human
rights
are
respected
protected
promoted
and
fulfilled
That
is
why
the
Initiative
establishes
significant
new
commitments
for
company
NGO
investor
and
academic
participants
to
collaborate
with
each
other
to
promote
the
rule
of
law
and
the
adoption
of
laws
policies
and
practices
that
protect
and
respect
freedom
of
expression
and
privacy
Protecting
freedom
of
expression
and
privacy
in
a
climate
of
rapidly
changing
technologies
products
and
services
is
a
complex
and
constantly
evolving
task
so
collaboration
among
participants
to
lobby
governments
dialogue
with
stakeholders
in
local
markets
and
share
learning
from
their
experiences
will
be
critical
to
the
success
of
the
Initiative
The
participants
also
announced
the
formation
of
an
organization
to
promote
and
support
the
long-term
success
of
the
Initiative
A
multi-stakeholder
governance
structure
for
the
Initiative
is
being
established
to
support
joint
efforts
by
all
participants
and
ensure
the
accountability
of
the
participating
companies
The
success
of
the
Initiative
in
establishing
a
worldwide
standard
requires
a
global
perspective
that
is
broadly
based
in
the
information
and
communications
industry
Therefore
a
key
priority
of
the
Initiative
is
actively
recruiting
new
members
from
business
academia
investors
and
civil
society
with
a
clear
commitment
to
the
advancement
of
freedom
of
expression
and
privacy
The
Initiative
is
the
outcome
of
a
multi-stakeholder
process
that
began
in
2006
and
was
formalized
in
early
2007
The
group
has
closely
examined
issues
and
cases
relating
to
freedom
of
expression
and
privacy
around
the
world
as
well
as
relevant
international
laws
and
standards
and
a
number
of
global
multi-stakeholder
processes
in
other
industries

Christian
Science
Monitor
to
Stop
Print
Edition
Just
about
to
celebrate
its
100th
anniversary
the
Christian
Science
Monitor
is
announcing
it
will
stop
publishing
its
print
edition
and
shift
completely
to
Internet
operations
starting
April
2009
It
will
be
the
first
national
newspaper
in
the
US
to
make
this
radical
change
yet
another
symptom
of
the
steady
decline
of
the
US
newspaper
industry
The
announcement
is
on
the
paper's
front
page
of
its
Internet
edition
This
new
multiplatform
strategy
for
the
Monitor
will
secure
and
enlarge
the
Monitor's
role
in
its
second
century
said
Mary
Trammell
editor
in
chief
of
The
Christian
Science
Publishing
Society
and
a
member
of
the
Christian
Science
Board
of
Directors
Mrs
Trammell
said
that
journalism
that
seeks
to
bless
humanity
not
injure
and
that
shines
light
on
the
world's
challenges
in
an
effort
to
seek
solutions
is
at
the
center
of
Mary
Baker
Eddy's
vision
for
the
Monitor
The
method
of
delivery
and
format
are
secondary
and
need
to
be
adjusted
given
Mrs
Eddy's
call
to
keep
the
Monitor
abreast
of
the
times
While
the
Monitor's
print
circulation
which
is
primarily
delivered
by
US
mail
has
trended
downward
for
nearly
40
years
looking
forward
the
Monitor's
Web
readership
clearly
shows
promise
said
Judy
Wolff
chairman
of
the
Board
of
Trustees
of
The
Christian
Science
Publishing
Society
We
plan
to
take
advantage
of
the
Internet
in
order
to
deliver
the
Monitor's
journalism
more
quickly
to
improve
the
Monitor's
timeliness
and
relevance
and
to
increase
revenue
and
reduce
costs
We
can
do
this
by
changing
the
way
the
Monitor
reaches
its
readers
The
Monitor
which
celebrates
its
100th
anniversary
on
Nov
25
was
launched
at
the
direction
of
church
founder
Eddy
who
had
been
the
subject
of
a
searing
legal
and
journalistic
attack
by
Joseph
Pulitzer's
New
York
World
Officials
of
her
church
had
a
professional
news
organization
up
and
running
in
just
over
100
days

Global
Network
Initiative
to
Be
Launched
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Oct
29
will
see
the
worldwide
launching
of
the
Global
Network
Initiative
GNI
an
effort
to
improve
free
speech
and
privacy
protection
on
the
Internet
Google
Microsoft
and
Yahoo
along
with
several
NGO's
including
the
World
Press
Freedom
Committee
will
introduce
a
set
of
principles
to
avoid
or
minimize
the
impact
of
government
restrictions
on
freedom
of
expression
Here
is
from
The
New
York
Times
Stating
that
privacy
is
a
human
right
and
guarantor
of
human
dignity
the
initiative
commits
the
companies
to
try
to
resist
overly
broad
demands
for
restrictions
on
freedom
of
speech
and
overly
broad
demands
that
could
compromise
the
privacy
of
their
users
The
initiative
was
begun
after
human
rights
groups
and
Congress
criticized
the
Internet
companies
for
cooperating
with
Chinese
government
censorship
and
demands
for
information
on
dissidents
In
addition
to
laying
out
the
code
of
conduct
the
initiative
will
provide
a
non-governmental
forum
for
the
companies
and
human
rights
groups
to
jointly
resist
demands
for
censorship
It
will
also
establish
a
system
of
independent
auditors
to
rate
the
companies
conduct
This
is
an
important
first
step
in
providing
standards
for
free
expression
and
privacy
that
obligate
companies
to
do
more
to
challenge
government
restrictions
said
Michael
Posner
president
of
Human
Rights
First
who
agreed
to
discuss
the
initiative
after
The
Times
obtained
the
documents
It
sets
up
an
accountability
mechanism
that
will
allow
each
of
the
companies
to
be
evaluated
over
time
Governments
throughout
the
world
especially
China
are
embarked
in
ambitious
censorship
schemes
aimed
at
eliminating
the
Internet's
most
powerful
feature
its
worldwide
free
flow
of
ideas
At
least
two
European
telecommunications
companies
France
Télécom
and
Vodafone
are
considering
being
part
of
GNI
On
the
other
hand
US
corporations
AT&T
Verizon
and
Sprint
Nextel
who
were
willing
participants
in
the
Bush
administration's
illegal
spying
in
the
US
are
still
to
sign
on
this
initiative

The
Milk
Stain
That
Won't
Go
Away
The
China
milk
scandal
a
vicious
circle
of
corruption
EPA
photo
The
more
we
dig
into
the
Chinese
tainted
milk
scandal
the
worse
it
stinks
and
at
the
core
of
this
boiling
pot
of
corruption
is
the
Chinese
regime's
hermetic
tendencies
Reporters
without
Borders
Washington
Representative
Licie
Morillon
confirms
that
official
censorship
was
the
main
culprit
of
the
scandal's
disastrous
consequences
that
have
left
four
babies
dead
and
53,000
sickened
in
China
Last
July
a
journalist
working
for
the
investigative
weekly
Nanfang
Zhoumo
Southern
Weekend
gathered
reliable
information
regarding
a
wave
of
hospitalizations
of
new-born
babies
with
four
killed
and
53,000
sickened
These
illnesses
were
linked
to
powered
milk
made
by
Chinese
dairy
company
Sanlu
The
writer's
editor
however
decided
not
to
publish
the
story
for
fear
of
government
reprisal
As
a
result
China
had
to
wait
until
after
the
Olympic
Games
until
early
September
before
another
news
outlet
dared
to
publish
this
explosive
news
Fu
Jianfeng
an
editor
at
Southern
Weekend
posted
a
damning
indictment
on
his
blog
after
the
scandal
became
public
in
September
Actually
our
reporter
He
Feng
had
received
the
information
at
the
end
of
July
that
more
than
20
babies
were
hospitalized
for
kidney
stones
in
Tongji
Hospital
Wuhan
city
Hubei
province
as
a
result
of
consuming
the
tainted
Sanlu
milk
powder
But
for
reasons
that
everybody
knows
we
were
not
able
to
investigate
the
case
at
that
time
because
harmony
was
needed
everywhere
As
a
news
editor
I
was
deeply
concerned
because

sensed
that
this

defeat

Tunisian
Free
Press
at
the
Mercy
of
All
Mighty
State
On
Oct
8
the
independent
online
magazine
Kalima
a
strong
critic
of
the
regime
of
President
Zine
Al-Abidine
Ben
Ali
was
disabled
and
its
content
completely
destroyed
Kalima's
editor-in-chief
Sihem
Bensedrine
has
no
doubt
that
the
attack
was
perpetrated
by
someone
in
close
cooperation
with
the
regime
of
President
Ben
Ali
and
proves
once
more
press
freedom
in
Tunisia
at
least
for
now
is
a
chimera
Kalima's
case
is
not
unique
as
other
Tunisian
independent
sites
have
been
shut
down
in
the
past
including
Tunisnews
and
Tunisiawatch
Leading
human
rights
activist
Naziha
Rjiba
above
distributed
the
following
opinion
piece
about
the
attack
on
Kalima
After
a
long
and
hard
fight
against
an
illness
which
preoccupied
me
for
the
entire
summer
I
recovered
finally
my
health
and
prepared
to
pick
up
my
pen
again
But
it
is
vain
to
talk
about
health
in
a
country
that
is
sick
and
where
the
climate
is
contaminated
The
hand
of
injustice
cowardice
and
pettiness
hit
the
website
of
Kalima
to
reduce
it
to
nothing
The
attacked
was
one
but
the
attackers
many
it
is
imperative
to
unveil
them
The
regime
is
without
any
doubt
the
instigator
of
the
attack
against
our
website
Because
it's
a
regime
of
pirates
and
highway
men
and
particularly
if
these
highways
would
lead
toward
the
discovery
of
the
true
and
hideous
nature
of
this
regime
like
the
road
followed
by
Kalima
Thus
this
new
abuse
of
power
is
a
new
indicator
which
denounces
the
regime
and
sheds
light
not
only
on
its
nature
but
also
on
the
level
of
its
fear
of
seeing
its
face
mirrored
by
a
free
media
which
does
not
practise
neither
complaisance
nor
opportunism
and
which
does
not
sacrifice
truth
under
any
pretext
or
for
any
kind
of
benefit
It
is
the
hand
of
a
Tunisian
expert
a
male
or
female
computer
engineer
which
must
have
executed
this
abuse
This
expert
is
probably
a
frequent
and
insatiable
visitor
to
the
site
of
Kalima
and
other
sites
of
the
citizens
resistance
to
oppression
who
likes
to
read
their
content
and
admire
the
courage
of
their
contributors
Nevertheless
this
expert
has
executed
the
orders
that
were
dictated
to
him
to
destroy
what
he
had
learned
to
love

US
Newspapers
Circulation
Continues
Steep
Decline
The
Washington
Post
is
one
of
the
big
losers
The
last
six
months
recorded
from
April
to
September
of
this
year
507
major
US
newspaper
circulation
dropped
by
4.6
percent
Editor
Publisher
the
industry's
trade
publication
reports
The
daily
drop
was
made
worse
by
an
even
steeper
4.8
percent
decline
in
Sunday
sales
which
more
than
doubles
the
size
of
the
previous
period's
performance
2.6
percent
According
to
the
Audit
Bureau
of
Circulation
daily
circulation
slipped
4.6
to
38,165,848
copies
For
the
571
papers
Sunday
dropped
4.8
to
43,631,646
copies
Daily
circulation
at
The
New
York
Times
fell
3.5
to
1,000,665
copies
The
Wall
Street
Journal
as
we
reported
last
week
was
virtually
flat
up
about
117
copies
on
a
daily
basis
to
2,011,999
USA
Today
was
also
up
a
fraction
of
a
percent
to
2,293,310
copies
But
The
Washington
Post's
daily
circulation
declined
1.9
to
622,714
Sunday
was
down
3.1
to
866,057
At
the
Los
Angeles
Times
circulation
decreased
a
little
more
5
daily
and
on
Sunday
to
739,147
and
1,055,076
respectively
Daily
circulation
at
the
Chicago
Tribune
was
down
7.7
to
516,032
Sunday
declined
5.7
to
864,845
copies
The
San
Francisco
Chronicle
lost
7
of
its
daily
circulation
to
339,430
copies
while
Sunday
was
down
a
hair
more
7.4
to
398,116
The
San
Jose
Mercury
News
was
down
slightly
1.9
to
224,199
and
Sunday
was
down
much
more
4.3
to
241,518
The
bleeding
is
not
unique
to
US
newspapers
as
we
reported
here
And
as
we
said
back
then
the
newspaper
industry
needs
to
find
a
winning
formula
that
integrates
the
Internet
variable
into
its
so
far
losing
equation

Croatian
Mafia
Blamed
in
Killings
of
Journalists
The
Financial
Times
FT
reports
the
Croatian
mafia
is
the
prime
suspect
in
the
killings
of
investigative
journalist
Ivo
Pukanic
above
owner
and
editor-in-chief
of

a
political
weekly
and
Niko
Franjic
a
close
associate
of
his
Remains

EPA

points
out
that
the
attack
is
a
sharp
reminder
that
Croatia
has
a
dark
side
so
dangerous
that
it
threatens
to
destabilise
the
whole
country
meaning
the
pernicious
influence
organized
crime
has
on
the
entire
country
Pukanic
who
had
alleged
links
to
the
mafia
was
not
the
cleanest
journalist
in
the
Balkans
But
that
is
beside
the
point
Nobody
should
face
extrajudicial
execution
especially
not
in
a
country
hoping
to
join
the
European
Union
Ivo
Sanader
prime
minister
condemned
the
car
bombing
saying
I
shall
not
allow
Croatia
to
become
another
Beirut
This
is
no
longer
a
fight
against
organised
crime
This
is
something
all
of
us
in
Croatia
will
rise
up
against
He
must
deliver
on
his
pledge
For
too
long
the
authorities
have
dragged
their
feet
over
fighting
crime
Newspapers
have
often
published
allegations
of
links
between
criminals
businessmen
and
politicians
But
the
authorities
have
not
responded
effectively
Under
public
pressure
Mr
Sanader
this
month
finally
replaced
his
justice
and
interior
ministers
after
Ms
Hodak's
killing
Now
the
authorities
must
launch
a
real
crackdown
on
crime
Serbia
managed
it
after
the
2003
shooting
of
Zoran
Djindjic
the
late
prime
minister
If
Belgrade
could
act
in
far
more
fragile
political
conditions
than
Croatia's
Zagreb
must
follow
suit
The
EU
which
sees
Croatia
as
its
next
accession
candidate
must
ensure
Zagreb
transforms
its
record
on
fighting
crime
well
before
it
actually
enters
the
union
The
embarrassing
example
of
Bulgaria
which
joined
the
EU
before
the
job
was
done
should
make
Brussels
take
extra
care
with
its
future

in
the
western
Balkans
If
that
means
making
Croatia
wait
then
Croatia
must
wait
Sunshine
alone
is
not
a
protection
against
crime
Just
ask

Sicilians

Tunisian
NGO
Stands
up
to
Attacks
on
Human
Rights
Defenders
EPA

The
government
of
Tunisian
President
Zine
Al-Abidine
Ben
Ali
above
has
toughened
up
its
repression
on
press
freedom
and
other
human
rights
groups
and
their
websites
in
that
country
Ben
Ali's
21
years
monopoly
on
power
has
a
long
history
of
repression
on
opposition
groups
and
courageous
members
of
a
struggling
independent
press
And
the
latest
wave
of
attacks
has
produced
the
following
reaction
by
the
Tunisian
Monitoring
Group
The
members
of
the
Tunisia
Monitoring
Group
TMG
a
coalition
of
18
freedom
of
expression
organisations
who
belong
to
the
International
Freedom
of
Expression
Exchange
IFEX
network
are
concerned
about
recent
attacks
against
human
rights
defenders
and
representatives
of
independent
media
outlets
in
Tunisia
The
TMG
believes
that
these
attacks
are
part
of
a
broader
pattern
of
intimidation
against
journalists
and
free
media
advocates
perpetrated
by
the
Tunisian
authorities
to
curb
freedom
of
expression
in
the
country
The
TMG
has
been
informed
that
the
website
of
Kalima
an
independent
online
newspaper
that
has
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
register
in
the
country
since
2000
was
recently
attacked
by
hackers
who
completely
destroyed
its
content
The
damage
was
so
severe
that
Kalima's
webmasters
have
been
unable
to
access
the
site
since
8
October
and
it
will
now
need
to
be
completely
rebuilt
We
are
pleased
that
Kalima
will
re-launch
again
and
hope
it
will
not
be
destroyed
again
Disconcertingly
Kalima's
website
which
was
recently
re-launched
as
a
multimedia
platform
and
archive
and
could
be
a
very
important
source
of
information
for
Tunisian
citizens
is
one
of
several
independent
Tunisian
and
foreign
websites
with
a
political
or
human
rights
focus
that
have
been
intermittently
inaccessible
to
Internet
users
in
Tunisia
during
the
past
several
years
Furthermore
members
of
the
TMG
strongly
condemn
the
recent
attacks
by
plainclothes
political
police
officers
against
Kalima's
editor
and
founder
Sihem
Bensedrine
who
is
also
head
of
the
Observatory
for
the
Freedom
of
Press
Publishing
and
Creation
in
Tunisia
OLPEC
IFEX's
member
in
Tunisia
Bensedrine
was
subjected
to
physical
and
verbal
abuse
in
downtown
Tunis
on
her
way
to
a
solidarity
rally
for
writer
and
activist
Zakia
Dhifaoui
currently
serving
an
eight-month
prison
sentence
in
connection
with
her
human
rights
advocacy
work
Commenting
on
the
incident
TMG
Chair
and
Index
on
Censorship
Associate
Editor
Rohan
Jayasekera
said
The
Tunisian
authorities
intolerance
of
peaceful
independent
opinion
is
well
known
and
well
recorded
and
increasingly
condemned
by
Tunisia's
international
partners
Yet
this
kind
of
thuggery
continues
to
prevail
Naziha
Rjiba
Deputy
President
of
OLPEC
and
a
well-known
writer
is
now
also
under
intensifying
pressure
The
TMG
is
alarmed
to
hear
that
she
has
been
summoned
to
appear
before
a
public
prosecutor
on
27
October
after
she
wrote
a
critical
opinion
piece
in
the
opposition
weekly
Mouatinoun
about
the
destruction
of
Kalima
in
which
she
accused
Tunisian
authorities
of
being
behind
the
attack
The
22
October
issue
of
Mouatinoun
has
been
banned
Rejiba's
husband
Mokhtar
Jallali
a
member
of
the
National
Council
for
Liberties
in
Tunisia
CNLT
is
currently
in
jail
after
being
involved
in
a
fatal
traffic
accident
for
which
he
was
not
responsible
CNLT
says
that
he
is
being
detained
in
order
to
settle
scores
with
rights
defenders
because
Jallali
is
a
member
of
CNLT
and
the
husband
of
Rejiba
whose
pen
name
is
Om
Zied
CNLT
says
the
family
has
already
received
indirect
threats
targeting
their
security
and
freedom

Zimbabwe
the
Final
Press
Freedom

We
keep
wondering
how
far

how
outrageous
the

on

media
can

Zimbabwe
Well
the
answers
keep

Zimbabwe's

We
get
word
from
the
Media
Institute
of
Southern

MISA
that
the
regime
is
hacking
the
very
email
accounts
of
its
own
controlled
media
including
the
private
email
of
one
of
the
editors
Bhekinkosi
Ncube
as
authorised
by
the
group's
chief
executive
officer
Justin
Mutasa
Following
Ncube's
suspension
as
editor
of
the
vernacular
tabloid
Umthunywa
Mutasa
told
an
internal
disciplinary
hearing
following
Ncube's
suspension
as

that
he
authorised
the
hacking
of

of
insulting
President
Robert
Mugabe
and
the
government
in
private
emails
exchanged
with
friends
on
the
political
situation
prevailing
in
the
country
According
to
minutes
of
the
proceedings
obtained
by
the
weekly
privately
owned
The
Standard
newspaper
Tom
Ndovi
Zimpapers
information
technology
manager
told
the
hearing
that
he
accessed
all
the

editors
private
emails
using
software
known
as
password
cracker
and
presented
all
the
findings
to
the
chief

officer
Ndovi
reportedly
testified
that
he
was
instructed
to
snoop
into
the
editor's
private
emails
during
3
15
August
2008
Mutasa
also
admitted
that
editorial
standards
are
not
set
by
the

officer
but
were
the
prerogative
of

must
comply
Mutasa
is
reported
as
having
told
the
hearing
Ncube's
lawyers
are
arguing
that
the
evidence
against
him
violated
the

Act
as

The

Never

were

with
their
European
Union
counterparts
about
the
current
world

crisis
Never

that
they

that
it
would

affront
Never

they

getting

way
around

Even
so
the
European
Parliament
today
awarded
its
highest
human
rights
prize
the
Sakharov
Prize
to
one
of
China's
most
prominent
human
rights
fighters
35-year-old
Hu
Jia
above
who
has
distinguished
himself
by
advocating
for
environmental
and
AIDS-HIV
causes
via
the
Internet
In
April
Hu
was
sentenced
to
3
and
a
half
years
in
prison
for
inciting
subversion
against
the
state
and
has
been
in
prison
since
December
after
months
of
house
arrest
The
decision
felt
like
a
wrench
in
the
Chinese
government's
blender
Here's
from
the
Wall
Street
Journal
To
present
this
type
of
prize
to
a
criminal
amounts
to
interference
with
China's
judicial
sovereignty
and
also
shows
disrespect
towards
human
rights
said
spokesman
Qin
Gang
of
China's
Ministry
of
Foreign
Affairs
before
the
announcement
was
made
We
oppose
the
use
of
the
human-rights
issue
to
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
other
countries
he
added
Hu
Jia
is
a
criminal
found
guilty
by
the
Chinese
judicial
apparatus
for
instigating
subversion
of
the
state
The
award
firmly
and
resolutely
acknowledges
the
daily
struggle
for
freedom
of
all
Chinese
human-rights
defenders
said
the
Parliament's
president
Hans-Gert
Pottering
in
a
statement
posted
on
the
parliament's
Web
site
The
Sakharov
Prize
is
named
for
the
late
Soviet
physicist
Andrei
Sakharov
It
is
awarded
annually
to
individuals
or
organizations
who
have
made
an
important
contribution
to
human
rights
or
democracy
But
let's
all
keep
in
mind
the
terrible
ordeal
Hu
is
going
through
His
wife
Zeng
Jiang
has
reported
that
he
is
suffering
from
cirrhosis
and
is
in
very
poor
health
We
do
welcome
this
wise
decision
and
hope
that
the
international
community
will
finally
wake
up
from
their
Chinese
slumber
and
firmly
denounce
the
Beijing
regime's
abuses
There
is
a
lot
to
catch
up
with
but
this
is
a
promising
start
