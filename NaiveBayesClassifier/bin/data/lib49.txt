Well
the
cat
is
out
of
the
carpetbag
Steve
is
off
to
The
Washington
Monthly
to
become
a
real
political
animal
It
couldn't
happen
to
a
more
deserving
guy
I've
known
Steve
before
there
was
a
Carpetbagger
Report
I
used
to
joke
about
him
being
the
biggest
political
nerd
I've
ever
known
and
I've
known
quite
a
few
One
unconfirmed
rumor
is
that
he
asked
his
parents
for
a
subscription
to
Congressional
Quarterly
for
his
8th
birthday
People
joke
about
Steve
being
some
kind
of
machine
because
of
the
amount
of
copy
he
generates
in
one
day
It
just
goes
to
show
what
a
12-hour
work
day
can
do
for
you
My
head
would
have
exploded
a
long
time
ago
but
Steve
plugs
right
along
He
lives
and
breathes
this
stuff
which
makes
his
analysis
so
penetrating
and
thoughtful
The
Carpetbagger
Report
has
a
truly
national
and
international
audience
but
I've
always
thought
it
should
be
larger
Steve's
new
home
will
make
that
possible
I
won't
be
taking
the
trip
over
to
the
Monthly
with
Steve
so
today
is
it
for
me
as
guest
blogger
I
just
want
to
say
thanks
to
all
who
have
read
my
posts
over
the
past
few
years
I
know
your
time
is
valuable
and
I
am
humbled
by
the
thought
that
you
would
spend
some
of
it
looking
at
what
I
have
to
say
I'd
like
to
think
I
was
a
good
ying
to
Steve's
yang
Steve
is
thoughtful
and
methodical
Although
he
produces
vast
amounts
of
copy
a
day
he
weighs
every
word
I've
observed
him
write
It's
like
you
can
see
the
cogs
turning
in
his
head
so
maybe
there's
something
to
this
machine
theory
after
all
My
style
is
more
shoot-from-the-hip
and
I
often
tried
to
break
things
up
with
a
little
humor
Sometimes
it
worked
and
sometimes
it
didn't
and
I'm
sure
there
are
posts
out
there
I'd
rather
drop
down
the
memory
hole
No
matter
it
was
always
a
whole
lot
of
fun
It
was
never
my
ambition
to
blog
full
time
I
simply
lack
Steve's
ambition
and
drive
in
that
area
More
to
the
point
I
have
a
full-time
job
and
two
children
But
I
had
a
ball
visiting
here
on
Saturdays
and
it's
possible
you
haven't
heard
the
last
from
me
I
will
be
among
Steve's
loyal
readers
at
the
Monthly
Who
knows
I
might
even
offer
a
comment
or
two
Now
get
on
over
to
www.washingtonmonthly.com
to
see
what
Steve
has
to
say

Just
a
reminder
as
we
discussed
earlier
in
the
week
today
is
the
last
day
I'll
be
posting
content
to
The
Carpetbagger
Report
Starting
first
thing
in
the
morning
I'll
be
writing
exclusively
for
the
Washington
Monthly's
Political
Animal
blog
It's
right
here
A
couple
of
other
quick
notes
First
my
friend
Morbo
will
have
a
sign-off
item
on
Saturday
morning
so
be
sure
to
stop
by
Second
a
lot
of
you
asked
about
whether
the
Carpetbagger
archives
will
still
be
accessible
They
will
and
they'll
be
available
by
week
and
month
What's
more
the
search
function
will
still
work
and
the
email
address
you
have
for
me
will
also
remain
active
And
third
many
of
you
had
very
helpful
suggestions
and
ideas
about
changes
you'd
like
to
see
to
Political
Animal
I've
been
pulling
all
of
the
recommendations
together
and
promise
to
see
what
I
can
do
I'm
hesitant
about
being
the
new
guy
coming
in
and
wanting
to
make
a
bunch
of
changes
so
I
hope
readers
will
be
patient
Most
notably
those
readers
who
want
to
see
a
full-post
RSS
feed
will
be
pleased
to
know
one
is
available
here
My
most
sincere
thanks
to
everyone
for
all
the
positive
feedback
and
encouragement
I
hope
to
see
all
of
you
tomorrow
morning
in
the

The
birds
of
prey
have
landed
at
McCain
campaign
headquarters

Oddly
enough
when
I
started
going
through
the
news
this
morning
I
noticed
a
story
about
John
McCain
criticizing
lobbyists
and
thought
that
would
have
to
be
the
big
political
story
the
day
That
of
course
was
before
I
noticed
that
McCain
couldn't
keep
track
of
all
the
houses
he
owns
Nevertheless
overshadowed
or
not
this
really
is
pretty
crazy
Sen
John
McCain
R-Ariz
called
lobbyists
birds
of
prey
Wednesday
and
vowed
to
enforce
a
lifetime
ban
on
lobbying
for
members
of
his
administration
Whenever
there's
a
corrupt
system
then
you're
going
to
have
these
birds
of
prey
descend
on
it
to
get
their
share
of
the
spoils
McCain
said
in
a
half-hour
interview
with
Politico
following
a
town-hall
meeting
in
the
southern
part
of
this
swing
state
The
senator
went
so
far
as
to
say
Lobbyists
don't
come
to
my
office
Because
they
know
they're
not
going
to
be
an
earmark
They
know
they're
not
going
to
get
a
pork-barrel
project
Even
by
McCain
standards
this
is
transparent
nonsense
Putting
aside
the
fact
that
McCain
like
every
other
senator
has
sought
and
received
earmark
the
reality
is
lobbyists
do
come
to
McCain's
office
and
as
a
rule
once
they
get
there
they're
given
influential
jobs
in
the
McCain
campaign

Spakovsky
lands

will

Hans
von
Spakovsky
as
a
top
political
appointee
in
Bush's
Justice
Department
was
a
leading
player
in
what
has
been
labeled
the
administration's
vote-suppression
agenda
When
it
came
to
voter
disenfranchisement
von
Spakovsky
was
a
reliable
member
of
Team
Bush
And
as
a
reward
Bush
tried
to
promote
von
Spakovsky
to
a
six-year
term
on
the
Federal
Election
Commission
which
touched
off
a
major
fight
with
Senate
Democrats
and
in
turn
effectively
shut
down
the
FEC
for
months
In
May
Dems
won
when
Spakovsky
withdrew
from
consideration
In
August
Americans
lost
as
Spakovsky
was
hired
as
a
consultant
to
the
U.S
Commission
on
Civil
Rights
If
Spakovsky's
history
of
backing
efforts
to
make
voting
more
difficult
strikes
you
as
a
poor
fit
with
the
Commission's
mission
of
defending
voter
rights
consider
that
of
the
eight
current
commissioners
at
the
agency
only
two
are
registered
Democrats
a
politicization
that
the
New
York
Times
Charlie
Savage
brought
to
light
last
year
Among
Spakovsky's
duties
will
be
overseeing
the
USCCR's
report
on
the
Justice
Department's
monitoring
of
the
2008
presidential
elections
a
source
inside
the
USCCR
told
TPMmuckraker
Spakovsky's
hiring
is
at
the
request
of
Commissioner
Todd
Gaziano
who
works
for
the
conservative
Heritage
Foundation
on
FEC
issues
and
has
defended
Spakovsky
in
the
press
before
According
to
a
federal
government
source
Gaziano
has
recommended
Spakovsky
at
the
government's
highest
payscale
which
would
work
out
to
about
124,010
annually
if
Spakovsky
was
to
stay
for
an
entire
year
This
is
crazy
The
guy
who
was
accused
of
voter-suppression
tactics
has
no
business
helping
monitor
to
the
elections
on

of

and

A

The
initial
response
from
the
McCain
campaign
on
the
senator's
confusion
about
how
many
homes
he
owns
was
pretty
weak
Put
it
this
way
it
talked
about
arugula
and
Hawaii
A
couple
of
hours
later
though
the
McCain
gang
went
with
the
one
response
that
applies
to
every
question
The
McCain
campaign
is
road-testing
a
new
argument
in
responding
to
Obama's
criticism
of
his
number-of-houses
gaffe
an
approach
the
McCain
camp
has
never
tried
before
The
houses
gaffe
doesn't
matter
because
he
was
a
P.O.W
This
is
a
guy
who
lived
in
one
house
for
five
and
a
half
years
in
prison

Brian
Rogers
told
the
Washington
Post
I

When
the
Rev
Kirbyjon
Caldwell
a
close
Bush
ally
publicly
questioned
McCain's
marital
infidelities
the
McCain
campaign
responded
by
highlighting
McCain's
background
as
a
prisoner
of
war
When
Dems
attacked
McCain's
healthcare
plan
in
May
McCain
responded
by
noting
his
background
as
a
prisoner
of
war
Asked
by
a
local
reporter
about
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
his
mind
when
he
thinks
of
Pittsburgh
McCain
responded
by
talking
about
his
background
as
a
prisoner
of
war
Accused
of
possibly
having
heard
the
questions
in
advance
of
Rick
Warren's
recent
candidate
forum
the
McCain
campaign
responded
by
highlighting
McCain's
background

Exactly
how
many
homes
does
McCain
own
Posted

We
know
that
John
McCain
owns
so
many
homes
he's
lost
track
of
the
exact
number
But
as
long
as
it's
the
topic
du
jour
maybe
we
should
go
ahead
and
answer
the
question
McCain
is
struggling
with
how
many
homes
does
McCain
own
The
McCain
campaign
conceded
that
the
senator
owns
at
least
four
The
new
Obama
ad
puts
the
number
at
seven
There's
one
estimate
that
points
to
10
homes
and
I
saw
one
count
that
pegs
it
at
13
properties
Yglesias
noted
I've
seen
a
lot
of
liberals
giving
John
McCain
a
hard
time
about
not
knowing
how
many
homes
he
owns
But
this
is
a
genuinely
difficult
question
to
answer
It
actually
is
tricky
First
McCain
owns
a
lot
of
homes
Second
he
owns
a
lot
of
properties
with
multiples
homes
on
the
properties
And
third
in
a
couple
of
instances
McCain
has
bought
two
homes
only
to
start
tearing
down
walls
to
create
super-duper
homes
Do
we
count
the
700,000
condo
McCain
bought
for
his
daughter
as
a
graduation
present
Decisions
decisions
The
estimable
Jed
Lewison
put
together
a
very
helpful
Google
Earth
tour
that
helps
sort
through
the
presumptive
Republican
nominee's
extensive
portfolio
I'd
just
add
that
the
McCain
campaign's
odd
arugula
based
response
chastises
Obama
for
having
made
4
million
last
year
Maybe
the
McCain
gang
can
clarify
doesn't
that
make
Obama
by
McCain's
standards
middle
class
Post
Script
Alas
there
is
no
video
of
McCain
struggling
with
the
question
but
there
is
an
audio
file
I'm
expecting
some
clever
audiophile
to
have
a

Have
you
had
the
feeling
that
the
Obama
campaign
has
seemed
troubled
of
late
They're
on
the
ropes
slipping
in
the
polls
Maybe
they
could
use
a
little
spark
to
help
shake
up
the
race
Based
on
the
last
few
hours
I
think
they
got
one
We
talked
earlier
about
a
reporter
from
the
Politico
asking
John
McCain
yesterday
how
many
homes
he
owns
I
think
I'll
have
my
staff
get
to
you
McCain
said
It's
condominiums
where
I'll
have
them
get
to
you
In
an
impressive
display
of
rapid-response
the
Obama
campaign
already
has
a
new
ad
out
capitalizing
Around
the
same
time
the
campaign
was
unveiling
the
ad
Obama
was
hosting
a
town-hall
event
in
Virginia
and
kept
the
pressure
on
I
guess
if
you
think
that
being
rich
means
you've
got
to
make
5
million
and
if
you
don't
know
how
many
houses
you
have
then
it's
not
surprising
that
you
might
think
the
economy
was
fundamentally
strong
Obama
said
But
if
you're
like
me
and
you've
got
one
house
or
you
are
like
the
millions
of
people
who
are
struggling
right
now
to
keep
up
with
their
mortgage
so
they
don't
lose
their
home
you
might
have
a
different
perspective
So
there's
just
a
fundamental
gap
of
understanding
between
John
McCain's
world
and
what
people
are
going
through
every
single
day
here
in
America
This
is
a
pretty
devastating
message
That
McCain
has
so
many
homes
he's
lost
track
of
the
number
is
embarrassing
but
what's
damaging
about
this
story
is
the
way
in
which
it
ties
into
McCain's
misguided
economic
worldview
