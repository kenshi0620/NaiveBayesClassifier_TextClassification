Enough
with
the
early
post-mortems
already
You
know
we
really
don't
need
to
be
spending
time
analyzing
the
mistakes
of
the
Clinton
campaign
at
this
point
No
one
ever
gets
it
right
this
soon
after
it's
over
anyway
In
a
campaign
of
near-deaths
and
premature
obituaries
the
night
of
May
6
will
be
remembered
inside
Hillary
Rodham
Clinton's
campaign
as
the
moment
it
really
ended
But
there
was
a
sense
of
resignation
within
the
campaign
She
would
carry
on
but
the
outcome
was
inevitable
She
could
accept
losing
one
adviser
said
She
could
not
accept
quitting."I
don't
believe
that
she
was
always
nicest
person
on
the
campaign
trail
and
I
have
problems
with
her
characterizations
of
Obama
at
times
but
Politics
is
a
contact
sport
for
Grown-Ups
Had
she
won
the
nomination
I
would
have
supported
her
especially
against
any
of
the
republicans
we
saw
this
year

Dear
Mrs
Pelosi
Nancy
can
I
call
you
Nancy
After
all
you
do
work
for
me
and
all
those
fine
folks
in
CA
who
send
you
to
Washington
every
couple
of
years
and
of
course
the
American
People
You
are
third
in
line
to
the
presidency
and
have
been
granted
the
status
of
Leader
by
our
party
after
the
almost
historic
mid-term
upset
elections
in
2006
Nancy
I
need
to
ask
you
a
very
very
simple
question
Why
can't
we
have
an
Impeachment
hearing
based
on
the
lies
that
are
now
part
of
the
public
record
as
released
by
the
Senate
Select
Committee
on
Intelligence
We
as
Americans
stood
by
and
watched
your
Republican
colleagues
using
the
70
million
dollar
Starr
Report
and
softcore
porn
expo
run
an
impeachment
hearing
that
absorbed
our
nation
and
brought
the
Nation's
business
to
a
virtual
standstill
Bill
Clinton's
alleged
perfidy
gripped
us
for
months
and
years
as
pundits
and
congressmen
alike
screeched
Rule
of
Law
and
Liar
Nancy
no
one
died
when
Monica
Lewinsky
and
Bill
Clinton
had
consensual
adult
sexual
relations
in
the
People's
House
on
Pennsylvania
Avenue
Nancy
George
Bush
and
Dick
Cheney
manipulating
the
levers
of
power
secrecy
the
media
and
trust
of
the
American
people
have
managed
to
kill
over
4000
American
men
and
women
and
leave
tens
of
thousands
with
injuries
that
will
follow
them
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
Families
have
been
destroyed
by
a
war
that
was
absolutely
not
necessary
and
should
never
have
been
fought
I
do
understand
that
you
and
many
of
your
colleagues
were
afraid
to
stand
up
to
the
ruthless
political
machine
that
the
Bush
Administration
built
to
destroy
it's
enemies
domestic
and
foreign
I
understand
it
but
can
not
forgive
your
lack
of
political
or
moral
courage
to
stand
against
it
It
seems
to
me
and
many
many
other
Americans
that
you
were
and
are
more
interested
in
maintaining
your
personal
power
and
position
than
in
pursuing
the
truth
We
need
to
begin
Impeachment
because
the
claims
of
Executive
Privilege
will
not
survive
an
Impeachment
inquiry
With
the
revelations
that
administration
knowingly
lied
us
into
the
deaths
of
the
brave
American
men
and
women
sent
into
harm's
way
for
purely
political
gain
it
is
no
longer
acceptable
to
hear
you
and
other
Congressional
Leaders
say
that
Impeachment
is
off
the
table
It
is
important
that
accountability
begin
now
even
knowing
that
George
Bush
may
have
to
leave
office
before
an
inquiry
or
trial
can
be
completed
Such
work
is
important
to
allow
ongoing
investigations
and
perhaps
personal
accountability
even
criminal
prosecutions
from
such
work
It
is
important
for
us
all
and
our
children
as
well
During
the
Clinton
Scandal
the
right-wing
Republicans
were
fond
of
saying
with
some
mock
horror
in
their
voices
What
will
we
tell
the
children
about
their
president
being
a
philandering
sexually
active
if
unfaithful
husband
Well
what
will
you
tell
the
children
of
future
generations
when
they
are
sent
off
to
a
war
because
you
have
created
a
precedent
to
not
hold
any
future
Constitutional
Executive
accountable
for
the
lies
of
this
President
and
administration

Here's
what
you
get
with
McCain
and
Gramm
It's
not
gonna
stop
anytime
soon
and
it's
not
just
hitting
the
least
fortunate
among
us
it's
eating
the
fabric
of
the
middle-class
from
the
bottom
up
In
a
decade
handling
evictions
for
the
Miami-Dade
County
Police
Department
Albert
Fernandez
has
run
across
a
middle-class
father
bankrupted
by
his
daughterâ??s
cancer
treatment
an
old
woman
scammed
by
a
gambling
husband
and
countless
families
perpetually
on
the
edge
of
poverty
If
South
Florida
is
a
barometer
for
the
housing
crisis
and
the
economy
the
forecast
does
not
look
good
Like
other
areas
nationwide
evictions
are
rising
throughout
the
state
clogging
county
courts
and
spawning
a
boom
in
companies
that
specialize
in
eviction
services
like
moving
furniture
to
the
curb
In
the
first
three
months
of
this
year
Broward
County
tallied
3,043
eviction
requests
more
than
it
has
received
in
the
same
period
since
at
least
1999
and
an
increase
of
54
percent
over
last
year
In
Miami-Dade
landlords
filed
for
4,726
evictions
from
January
through
April
up
1,157
from
the
first
four
months
of
last
year.When
it's
not
just
the
tenants
that
are
getting
the
axe
but
the
landlords
as
well
it's
getting
downright
fever
swamp
in
the
tropics
of
South
Florida
These
economic
policies
were
set
in
motion
in
large
part
through
the
efforts
of
the
republicans
who
detested
the
banking
laws
enacted
by
FDR
in
the
days
of
the
Great
Depression
They
saw
and
still
see
the
government
as
having
no
business
in
regulating
business
Clearly
business
can
not
only
not
regulate
itself
it
has
no
desire
to
do
so
as
long
as
someone
at
the
top
of
the
food
chain
makes
a
profit
whether
it
be
executives
shareholders
or
both
Enron

major
banks

the

industry

disappear
down

pay
the
bills
or
they
are

take
her
hubby
her
extensive
collection
of
pantsuits
and
daughter
Chelsea

head

or
at
least
back

Apparently
as

she
is

with

on

She

She's

Lisa
Caputo
running
around
talking
about
the
18

like
they
are

Here's
an
idea
if
they
are
then
perhaps
each
of
them
could
cough
up
1.11
for
her
campaign
and
it
would
retire
her

Epiphany
Maybe
Of
sorts
I
guess
Mullah
Nadhim
preached
open
war
on
U.S
troops
for
years
In
Iraq
voters
fingers
are
dipped
in
ink
so
they
can't
vote
multiple
times
He
and
many
other
Sunni
Muslims
in
Iraq
shunned
elections
and
fought
instead
with
roadside
bombs
and
rocket-propelled
grenades
With
provincial
elections
scheduled
for
autumn
however
Nadhim
and
other
Sunnis
say
they
made
a
mistake
by
sitting
out
the
elections
in
January
2005
Their
absence
at
the
polls
they
say
resulted
in
less
political
power
for
Sunnis
and
more
for
Shiite
Muslims
and
Kurds.Now
if
someone
would
just
let
the
Shiites
know
that
they
need
to
honor
these
elections
perhaps
it
might
go
better
this
time
around
With
Iran
having
the
Shiites
collective
backs
and
no
interest
in
allowing
the
Sunni's
to
establish
a
base
inside
the
Iraqi
borders
I
am
pessimistic
about
the
long
term
outcome
of
this
effort
but
applaud
the
Sunni's
willing
to
give
it
a
try
Voting
is
always
better
than
shooting

you
are
Beloved
Glorious
War
Preznit
Leader
Whatever
the
date
one
former
member
of
the
Ansar

Sunna
militant
group
probably
will
be
among
those
casting
ballots
He
said
that
spurning
the
last
elections
in
favor
of
violence
left
Sunnis
in
Balad
largely
powerless
Right
now
everything
is
being
run
by
the
Shiites
he
said
God
willing
this
time
it
will
be
better
than
before."I
hope
so
no
one
in

country
deserves
what
we
did

Yeah
ya
think
It
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
and
after
what
seven
loooong
years
it
should
that
the
drones
who
run
the
Federal
Propaganda
Apparatus
Government
miss
the
fact
that
changing
human
nature
in
matters
like
sex
and
puberty
is
akin
to
changing
the
course
of
the
Mississippi
River
sure
there's
a
short-term
engineering
solution
but
sooner
or
later
Ol
Man
River
is
gonna
meander
back
to
the
way
it
wants
to
go
The
nation's
campaign
to
get
more
teenagers
to
delay
sex
and
use
condoms
is
faltering
threatening
to
undermine
the
highly
successful
effort
to
reduce
teen
pregnancy
and
protect
young
people
from
sexually
transmitted
diseases
federal
officials
reported
today
The
bottom
line
is
in
all
these
areas
we
don't
seem
to
be
making
the
progress
we
were
making
before
said
Howell
Wechsler
director
of
the
division
of
adolescent
and
school
health
at
the
federal
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
in
Atlanta
which
conducts
the
survey
It's
very
troubling."Yes
troubling
indeed
especially
given
the
belief
in
magic
that
the
1600
Crew
espouses
when
dealing
with
issues
like
teen
sexuality
and
STD's/Condoms
and
pregnancy
You
know
wave
a
wand
and
it
all
magically
just
doesn't
make
the
threshold
for
discussion
anymore
Except
when
it
doesn't
Coming
on
the
heels
of
reports
that
one
in
four
teenage
girls
has
a
sexually
transmitted
disease
and
that
the
teen
birth
rate
has
increased
for
the
first
time
in
15
years
the
data
is
triggering
alarm
across
the
ideological
spectrum
Since
we've
started
pushing
abstinence
we
have
seen
no
change
in
the
numbers
on
sexual
activity
said
John
Santelli
chairman
of
the
Department
of
Population
and
Family
Health
at
Columbia
University
The
other
piece
of
it
is
abstinence
education
spends
a
good
amount
of
time
bashing
condoms
So
it's
not
surprising
if
that's
the
message
young
people
are
getting
that
we're
seeing
condom
use
start
to
decrease
We
may
be
witnessing
the
beginning
of
a
trend
where
we're
reaping
the
harvest
of
medically
inaccurate
and
ineffective
sex
education
which
is
abstinence-until-marriage
sex
education
said
Michael
D
Resnick
who
studies
teen
sexual
behavior
at
the
University
of
Minnesota
With
a
growing
proportion
of
young
people
exposed
to
those
curricula
I
think
we
can
begin
to
understand
why
we're
beginning
to
see
a
reversal
of
the
positive
trends
that
had
been
happening."Get
that
Witnessing
a
trend
where
the
discouragement
of
condom
use
and
hence
safe
sex
is
being
promoted
because
the
chuckleheads
in
charge
don't
want
to
talk
responsibly
about
icky
sex
stuff
And
obviously
the
parents
of
these
kids
aren't
taking
up
the
slack
even
though
in
the
perfect
republican
world
they
will
educate
their
kids
because
jeebus
knows
we'd
never
want
educators
who
know
the
best
way
to
discuss
icky
sex
to
take
that
burden
up

to
ram
through
numerous
pieces
of
legislation
that
have
helped
bring
us
to
where
we
find
ourselves
today
In
the
early
evening
of
Friday
December
15
2000
with
Christmas
break
only
hours
away
the
U.S
Senate
rushed
to
pass
an
essential
11,000-page
government
reauthorization
bill
In
what
one
legal
textbook
would
later
call
a
stunning
departure
from
normal
legislative
practice
the
Senate
tacked
on
a
complex
262-page
amendment
at
the
urging
of
Texas
Sen
Phil
Gramm
There
was
little
debate
on
the
floor
According
to
the
Congressional
Record
Gramm
promised
that
the
amendment-also
known
as
the
Commodity
Futures
Modernization
Act-along
with
other
landmark
legislation
he
had
authored
would
usher
in
a
new
era
for
the
U.S
financial
services
industry
Watershed
indeed
With
the
U.S
economy
now
battered
by
a
tsunami
of
mortgage
foreclosures
the
30-billion
Bear
Stearns
Companies
bailout
and
spiking
food
and
energy
prices
many
congressional
leaders
and
Wall
Street
analysts
are
questioning
the
wisdom
of
the
radical
deregulation
launched
by
Grammâ??s
legislative
package.Yeah
John
your
friends
and
such
will
be
the
death
of
us
You
don't
want
what's
best
for
America
you
want
what's
best
for
your
friends
like
Phil
and
Wendy
After
all
when
they
make
money
you
are
obviously
happy

Hi
Remember
Me
I
have
been
away
training
for
a
new
job
and
am
finally
ready
to
get
back
into
the
blogging
again
I
don't
know
if
I
even
have
anyone
stopping
by
anymore
I
have
been
haunting
the
comments
over
at
Jane
Hamsher's
place
Firedoglake
for
the
last
few
months
and
now
I'm
back
here
too
So
to
start
it
off
did
everyone
see
the
Obama-AIPAC
speech
He
rhetorically
began
his
campaign
in
Philadelphia
Mississippi
in
a
completely
different
way
than
St
Ronnie
did
all
those
years
ago
His
appeal
to
the
sense
of
social
justice
that
led
to
those
young
men
to
Mississippi
and
ultimately
to
their
deaths
was
an
incredible
argument
in
front
of
the
AIPAC
folks
and
one
that
did
not
miss
the
symbolism
he
was
trying
to
build
on
with
his
remarks
Obama
it
is
It's
gonna
be
a
fun
ride
and
I'm
glad
to
be
here
watching
Thanks
for
being
here
too

Quotes
General
Wesley
Clark
presidential
candidate
I
think
we're
dealing
with
the
most
closed
imperialistic
nastiest
administration
in
living
memory
They
even
put
Richard
Nixon
to
shame
From
Shakespeare's
great
Henry
V
1599
Old
men
forget
yet
all
shall
be
forgot
But
he'll
remember
with
advantages
What
feats
he
did
that
day
then
shall
our
names
Familiar
in
his
mouth
as
household
words
Harry
the
king
Bedford
and
Exeter
Warwick
and
Talbot
Salisbury
and
Gloucester
Be
in
their
flowing
cups
freshly
remember'd
This
story
shall
the
good
man
teach
his
son
And
Crispin
Crispian
shall
ne'er
go
by
From
this
day
to
the
ending
of
the
world
But
we
in
it
shall
be
remember'd
We
few
we
happy
few
we
band
of
brothers
For
he
to-day
that
sheds
his
blood
with
me
Shall
be
my
brother
be
he
ne'er
so
vile
This
day
shall
gentle
his
condition
And
gentlemen
in
England
now
a-bed
Shall
think
themselves
accursed
they
were
not
here
And
hold
their
manhoods
cheap
whilst
any
speaks
That
fought
with
us
upon
Saint
Crispin's
day
And
Dick
Cheney
looking
like
he
needs
some
people
to
torture
walked
around
the
Gulf
Coast
and
got
cursed
at
by
a
doctor
Poor
bastard
was
detained
for
sneering
at
his
imperial
majesty
It
should
be
federal
law
that
the
Imperial
March
from
Star
Wars
be
played
at
all
Vice
Presidential
events
