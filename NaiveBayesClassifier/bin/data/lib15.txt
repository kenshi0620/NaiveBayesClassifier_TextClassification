In
spite
of
the
fact
that
a
New
York
Times/CBS
poll
finds
that
Gov
Sarah
Palin
is
a
drag
on
the
McCain
candidacy
59
say
she's
not
qualified
for
the
job
Eugene
Robinson
notes
that
win
or
lose
we
haven't
seen
the
last
of
Sarah
Palin
It's
tempting
to
think
of
Palin
as
a
kind
of
pop
star
the
latest
flash
in
the
pan
who
rockets
to
the
top
of
the
charts
and
then
fades
to
obscurity
Alec
Baldwin
referred
to
her
as
Bible
Spice
the
other
day
But
that
smug
assessment
ignores
the
evidence
that
she
has
the
chops
to
be
much
more
than
a
one-hit
wonder
Palin's
introduction
to
the
nation
was
disastrous
at
least
in
terms
of
appealing
to
a
constituency
beyond
the
conservative
wing
of
the
Republican
Party
It
was
obvious
from
the
beginning
that
she
wasn't
remotely
prepared
for
high
national
office
The
red-meat
Republican
base
was
energized
but
others
saw
McCain's
decision
to
put
her
on
the
ticket
as
cynical
and
irresponsible
Palin
herself
must
have
realized
that
her
debut
was
premature
But
as
Vernon
Jordan
likes
to
say
Opportunity
is
never
convenient
I
should
make
clear
that
I
believe
Palin
is
wrong
about
basically
everything
at
least
to
the
extent
that
we
know
what
she
really
believes
The
McCain
campaign
gave
her
a
job
to
do
slash
burn
fire
up
the
base
accuse
Barack
Obama
of
palling
around
with
terrorists
accuse
Obama
supporters
of
not
living
in
pro-America
parts
of
the
country
and
she
went
out
and
did
it
McCain's
campaign
rallies
often
have
a
sense
of
purpose
and
duty
about
them
Palin's
have
a
sense
of
electricity
That
she
wasn't
ready
to
meet
the
national
media
became
clear
when
she
sat
down
with
Katie
Couric
for
those
embarrassing
sessions
But
compare
the
bunny-in-the-headlights
Sarah
Palin
of
just
a
few
weeks
ago
with
the
much
more
poised
and
confident
Sarah
Palin
of
today
Ignorance
isn't
the
same
thing
as
stupidity
When
Palin
talks
about
economic
policy
these
days
her
sentences
don't
meander
into
the
Twilight
Zone
the
way
they
once
did
She
has
more
to
say
about
foreign
policy
besides
the
fact
that
Russia
is
just
across
the
Bering
Strait
She
has
learned
much
in
a
very
short
period
And
she
will
learn
more
I
predict
we'll
have
Sarah
Palin
to
kick
around
for
a
long
long
time.The
term
loose
cannon
comes
from
the
old
days
of
naval
warfare
when
the
artillery
got
loose
after
firing
on
another
ship
wreaking
havoc
on
the
deck
of
the
ship
that
fired
the
shot
while
the
cannonball
it
fired
usually
fell
harmlessly
into
the
sea
As
flashy
and
electrifying
Sarah
Palin
may
be
on
the
stump
I
predict
that
she
will
become
more
of
a
burden
to
the
Republicans
than
she
will
to
the
Democrats
And
she
will
give
us
in
the
blogosphere
hours
of
endless
fun
and
mockery
Bonus
Track
Former
Secretary
of
State
Lawrence
Eagleburger
one
of
John
McCain's
senior
advisers
offered
a
stunningly
frank
and
remarkably
bleak
assessment
of
Sarah
Palin's
capacity
to
handle
the
presidency
should
such
a
scenario
arise

This
has
already
been
all
over
the
blogosphere
but
just
in
case
no
one's
seen
it
yet
or
anyone
needs
to
have
another
laugh
at
it
here's
video
of
McCain
spokesperson
Michael
Goldfarb
engaging
in
wanton
fuckneckery
during
an
interview
with
CNN's
Rick
Sanchez
yesterday
I
really
don't
understand
why
the
media
doesn't
require
such
a
basic
qualification
of
wild
assertions
like
this
all
the

It

UPDATE
I
forgot
to
mention
this
Joe
Klein
piece
in
which
he
points
out
rather
amusingly
that
Khalidi
is
a
Palestinian
and
therefore
b
a
semite
And
it
should
also
be
noted
that
Khalidi
is
an
entirely
respectable
highly
respected
scholar
whose
views
as
John
Judis
notes
in
the
video
at
the
link
are
shared
by
many
leftist
Israelis
Sanchez
I
just
need
to
parse
this
out
as
best
I
can
from
ya
Michael
The
fact
that
John
McCain's
organization
gave
448,000
to
this
group
that
was
founded
by
Mr
Khalidi
is
there
no
reason
for
some
to
be
critical
of
that
as
well
just
as
some
might
be
critical
of
Barack
Obama
for
being
at
a
meeting
with
some
girl
who
read
a
poem
for
example
Goldfarb
Look
you're
missing
the
point
again
Rick
The
point
is
that
Barack
Obama
has
a
long
track
record
of
being
around
anti-Semitic
anti-Israel
and
anti-American
rhetoric
Sanchez
Can
you
name
one
other
person
besides
Khalidi
who
he
hangs
around
with
who
is
anti-Semitic
Goldfarb
Yeah
he
pals
around
with
with
William
Ayers
who
is
crosstalk
a
domestic
terrorist
Sanchez
William
Ayers
is
not
No
no
I
The
question
I
asked
you
is
Can
you
name
one
other
person
that
he
hangs
around
with
who's
anti-Semitic
because
that's
what
you
said
Goldfarb
Look
we
all
know
that
there
are
people
who
Barack
Obama
has
been
in
hot
water
Sanchez
Michael
I
asked
you
name
one
person
One
Goldfarb
Rick
Sanchez
You
said
he
hangs
around
with
people
who
are
anti-Semitic
You
okay
we
got
Khalidi
on
the
table
give
me
number
two
Who's
the
other
anti-Semitic
person
that
he
hangs
around
with
that
we
quote
all
know
about
Goldfarb
Rick
we
both
know
who
number
two
is
long
pause
Sanchez
WHO
long
pause
Sanchez
Would
you
tell
us
Goldfarb
No
Rick
I
think
we
all
know
who
we're
talking
about
here
Sanchez
Somebody
who's
anti-Semitic
that
he
hangs
around
with
Goldfarb
Absolutely
Sanchez
Well
say
it
Goldfarb
I
think
we
know
who
we're
talking
about
Rick
Sanchez
All
right
Again
you
charged
that
Khalidi
is
anti-Semitic
he
would
say
that
his
policies
on
Israel
differ
from
those
of
Barack
Obama
and
many
other
people
but
either
way
I
guess
we'll
have
to
leave
it
at
that
Michael
Goldfarb
thanks
so
much
We
really
do
appreciate
it
this
is
a
good
discussion
We
really
do
appreciate
your
coming
here
to
talk
to
us
Goldfarb
Thank
you

Constant
Comment
just
sent
me
this
story
which
had
it
happened
to
me
when
I
was
7
would
have
been
like
my
birthday
Halloween
and
Christmas
all
rolled
into
one
A
little
more
than
a
month
ago
teacher
Joyce
Ben-KiKi
had
7-year-old
Aron
Mondschein
and
his
second-grade
classmates
each
send
letters
to
a
famous
person
as
part
of
a
language
arts
lesson
Ben-KiKi
wrapped
the
exercise
around
well-known
children's
book
character
Flat
Stanley
so
along
with
the
letters
the
children
each
tucked
a
Flat
Stanley
figure
they
had
made
into
each
envelope
I
told
them
not
to
expect
a
letter
back
Ben-KiKi
said
I
told
them
these
people
are
very
busy
and
most
likely
will
not
write
back
The
list
of
recipients
was
impressive
Yankee
third
basemen
Alex
Rodriguez
Speaker
of
the
House
Nancy
Pelosi
Olympic
gold
medalist
Mark
Spitz
Republican
presidential
candidate
and
U.S
Sen
John
McCain
Aron
wrote
his
letter
to
Democratic
presidential
candidate
and
U.S
Sen
Barack
Obama
Obama
was
the
only
one
to
write
back
Obama's
three-page
letter
to
Aron
described
Flat
Stanley's
visit
with
him
and
his
staff
in
Washington
D.C
It
chronicled
their
busy
day
together
which
included
coffee
with
constituents
a
Senate
committee
meeting
and
a
trip
to
the
gym
It
also
had
historical
facts
about
the
U.S
Capitol
details
of
Obama's
job
and
a
confession
from
Obama
Sometimes
I
get
a
little
nervous
before
talking
in
front
of
a
crowd
but
Flat
Stanley
helped
me
practice
the
speech
Obama
wrote
He
made
me
recite
it
in
front
of
him
and
then
even
gave
me
some
advice
so
the
speech
would
go
smoothly
Flat
Stanley
is
really
a
great
coach."Two
other
boys
in
the
class
also
wrote
letters
to
Obama
and
they
received
replies
shortly
afterward
Amy
Mondschein
who
is
Aron's
mother
says
she
and
her
husband
rarely
talk
politics
at
home
except
to
teach
Aron
that
everybody
has
a
choice
in
the
election
and
we
have
to
respect
that
It's
their
right
to
like
whichever
candidate
they
do
and
that's
the
way
it
is
in
the
United
States
That's
why
we
live
here
He
excitedly
told
her
the
other
day
Mommy
when
I'm
18
I
get
to
vote
Given
this
post
you
can
imagine
how
I
feel
about
that
As
an
aside
this
should
go
without
saying
and
yet
probably
doesn't
I'm
not
presuming
Obama
actually
took
time
himself
to
write
the
letters
although
he
probably
did
sign
them
I'm
crediting
him
with
running
a
campaign
in
which
stuff
like
this
gets
paid
attention
to
It's
not
always
the
case
Hillary
Clinton
also
has
a
great
reputation
for
details
like
these
as
another
example
I
don't
know
and
have
never
spoken
to
anyone
involved
in
Obama's
campaign
but
I
do
know
some
people
who
work
for
Clinton
and
I
obviously
know
some
people
who
worked
for
John
Edwards
and
there
are
serious
efforts
made
within
campaigns
who
prioritize
responsiveness
to
respond
to
as
many
people
as

A
long
time
ago
in
a
galaxy
far
far
away
there
once
was
a
boy
named
Moses
He
survived
a
very
late-term
fourth
trimester
abortion
at
the
hands
of
a
Muslim
and
enemy
of
freedom
named
The
Pharaoh
The
Pharaoh
was
a
pro-abortion
baby-hater
and
advocate
of
same-sex
marriage
Needless
to
say
he
had
no
business
being
around
children
so
Moses's
caretaker
Grandma
Moses
chucked
him
in
the
Nile
Because
he
loved
the
baby
Jesus
and
prayed
a
bunch
Moses
was
not
eaten
by
crocs
but
instead
rescued
and
made
an
honorary
Egyptian
That
was
all
cool
until
God
got
a
wild
hair
and
decided
to
start
giving
a
shit
about
the
Israelites
and
commanded
Moses
to
lead
them
to
the
Promised
Land
The
Egyptians
didn't
like
this
idea
because
they
were
lazy
and
didn't
like
to
do
anything
themselves
and
had
made
all
the
Jews
their
slaves
Sucks
to
be
you
said
Moses
and
told
Yul
Brenner
they
were
gonna
book
Yul
was
pissed
and
asked
Allah
to
stop
them
but
Moses's
God
was
bigger
than
Yul's
God
and
He
put
the
serious
smackdown
on
the
Egyptians
God
unleashed
the
Ten
Plagues
on
Egypt
which
included
rivers
of
blood
raining
frogs
prop
comics
stubbed
toes
and
halitosis
God
even
killed
all
the
Egyptian
babies
just
to
show
he
wasn't
fucking
around
As
if
raining
frogs
wasn't
proof
enough
God's
pro-life
street
cred
was
not
tarnished
by
that
last
one
This
was
later
made
into
a
movie
starring
Hilary
Swank
So
Moses
and
the
Israelites
wandered
the
desert
for
forty
years
There
was
no
MapQuest
back
then
And
even
though
God
had
no
problem
raining
fire
and
locusts
down
on
an
entire
country
He
couldn't
be
bothered
to
give
Moses
a
fucking
compass
While
camped
out
near
Mt
Sinai
God
turned
into
a
burning
bush
and
told
Moses
to
come
visit
him
up
at
his
ski
cabin
in
the
hills
He
had
something
for
him
Moses
put
his
son
in
charge
while
he
was
on
vacation
which
turned
out
to
be
just
like
that
movie
Risky
Business
where
all
hell
breaks
loose
while
Dad
is
away
Moses's
son
Aaron
went
around
the
village
and
demanded
everyone
give
him
their
bling
so
he
could
melt
it
down
into
a
statue
of
a
calf
This
was
not
socialism
by
the
way
The
Israelites
worshipped
the
Golden
Calf
and
when
Moses
got
back
boy
was
he
pissed
As
it
turns
out
that
was
at
the
top
of
The
List
of
Very
Bad
Things
he
had
just
been
given
by
God
Moses
then
smashed
the
Golden
Calf
and
killed
everyone
who
had
worshipped
it
Sucks
to
be
you
The
moral
of
this
story
Worshipping
God
Good
Worshipping
Idols
Bad
Also
Don't
fuck
with
God
he
kills
babies
Fast-forward

Channel
TV
host
and
biblical
scholar
Cindy

to
prove
you
can
serve
God
and
Mammon
How
By
worshipping
a
Golden
Calf
Like
Moses
God
speaks
directly
to
her
and
He
recently
said
Nevermind

that
shit
I
wrote
in

Commandments
get
a

of
people
down
to

Street

I
just
got
back
from
voting
Yay
me
The
library
that
I
went
to
obviously
wasn't
prepared
for
today
I
wouldn't
say
there
was
chaos
but
the
line
wound
around
the
library
in
a
really
ridiculous
fashion
and
when
you
finally
got
to
the
room
with
the
voting
machines
everything
was
a
mess
Still
I
waited
patiently
glad
I
brought
a
book
for
two
hours
and
cast
my
vote
Electronic
voting
machine
Ugh
The
little
paper
printout
on
the
side
reassured
me
a
little
bit
but
I
just
have
too
much
mistrust
for
these
things
to
feel
completely
relaxed
However
upon
returning
to
my
office
Melissa
had
sent
me
this
link
that
made
me
feel
better
Yesterday
we
posted
a
quick
round-up
of
the
various
voter-suppression
schemes
being
pushed
by
Republicans
in
swing
states
around
the
country
And
after
looking
at
the
list
one
thing
quickly
becomes
clear
most
of
the
efforts
have
failed.It's
a
nice
little
list
of
various
vote
suppression
schemes
that
aren't
working
so
if
you
need
a
little
pick-me-up
check
it
out
This
isn't
to
say
of
course
that
all
of
them
are
failing
so
we
must
remain
alert
and
ready
to
stop
this
whenever
it
happens
Examples
In
Nevada
Secretary
of
State
Ross
Miller
denied
a
request
from
the
state
GOP
to
require
voters
to
cast
provisional
ballots
if
they
fixed
mistakes
in
their
voting
information
at
the
polls
In
Colorado
a
bid
by
Republican
Secretary
of
State
Mike
Coffman
who
himself
is
running
for
a
seat
in
the
U.S
House
to
purge
14,000
voters
from
the
rolls
was
only
partially
successful
After
voting-rights
groups
sued
a
settlement
was
reached
yesterday
allowing
the
voters
to
cast
provisional
ballots
According
to
the
Rocky
Mountain
News
those
ballots
would
be
presumed
to
be
valid
unless
state
and
county
officials
prove
otherwise
A
lawyer
for
the
voting-rights
groups
called
the
deal
a
win-win
Meanwhile
hilariously
Michelle
Malkin
no
link
you
know
where
to
find
her
if
you
must
is
continuing
to
gripe
about
voter
fraud
but
her
big
issue
is
this
evil
sinister
horrible
vote
suppressing
button
available
at
The
Gap
This
button
by
the
way
was
designed
by
John
Waters
Sometimes
life
is
beautiful
Update
I
just
looked
at
some
of
the
comments
on
Malkin's
post
about
this
button
and
I
started
laughing
so
hard
at
this
one
that
I
had
to
step
out
of
my
office
for
a
moment
Did
anyone
else
notice
that
there
is
red
on
the
top
of
the
button
and
many
stars
as
well
Perhaps
i'm
off
on
a
limb
but
is
it
possible
they
are
sending
subconscious
communist
propaganda?I
wish
I
could
buy
John
Waters
a
drink

now

The
Obama
campaign
reportedly
paid
around
3
million
to
air
their
30-minute
commercial
last
night
So
how'd
it
work
out
The
combined
overall
household
rating
for
Senator
Barack
Obama's
Wednesday
night
infomercial
in
the
top
56
local
television
markets
where
Nielsen
maintains
electronic
TV
meters
was
21.7.$3
million
to
reach
more
than
1
out
of
5
households
across
the
country
sounds
like
a
pretty
good
investment
I'm
kind
of
surprised
it
was
that
cheap
although
politicians
do
get
the
bargain-basement
ad
rates
I've
read
a
few
people
complaining
about
the
expenditure
in
almost
every
case
the
rhetorical
is
about
how
many
hungry
children
that
could
feed
Well
3
million
could
indeed
feed
lots
of
hungry
children
but
a
McCain
administration
would
undoubtedly
like
the
Bush
administration
create
millions
more
hungry
bellies
under
the
age
of
18
or
not
across
the
nation
So
in
the
long
view
the
investment
makes
sense
if
it
helps
Obama
beat
McCain
and
if
Obama's
going
to
pursue
policies
that
reverse
that
trend
which
is
probably
the
one
thing
I
feel
most
comfortable
trusting
he'll
do
None
of
that
changes
my
belief
that
presidential
campaigns
should
be
90
days
with
a
maximum
expenditure
of
like
30
bucks
Okay
maybe
a
little
more
than
that
But
within
the
current
state
of
campaign
law
and
practice
it
was
justifiable
Reasonable
within
an
unreasonable
paradigm
And
by
the
way
perhaps
the
greatest
incentive
for
the
GOP
to
start
seriously
advocating
campaign
reform
now
that
there's
a
Dem
on
the
scene
who's
gaming
the
system
more
successfully
than
they
are
Oh
the
irony

John

a
huge
jackass
I
know
that's

I'm
running

Reporter
Senator
McCain's

with
a

interviews
on
some
of
Miami's

Spanish-language

One
of

he

the

day
and
remained
undecided

you
hire

That
was

it
was
Because
spying

are

hilarious
Just
like

calling

Adopt
Us
Edition
Shaker
Darla's
friend
Elaine
rescued
a
mother
and
her
kittens
recently
and
is
committed
to
finding
all
five
kittens
good
homes
She's
already
paid
for
the
first
round
of
shots
and
is
desperate
to
find
adoptive
parents
for
these
little
dolls
so
if
you're
interested
and
are
near
or
can
get
to
the
Madison
NC
area
email
me
and
I'll
put
you
in
contact
with
Elaine
UPDATE
Elaine
also
adds
she'd
be
willing
to
drive
3
hours
one
way
to
meet
someone
with
a
kitten
Hi
there
We
were
born
under
a
bush
next
to
Elaine's
front
door
My
mom
is
scared
of
humans
so
she
picked
out
a
really
nice
bush
for
us
to
hide
under
When
the
humans
in
the
house
found
us
they
got
very
nervous
and
were
afraid
we
might
be
eaten
by
a
nasty
opossum
So
they
saved
us
and
put
us
in
a
warm
bed
on
the
porch
Now
the
humans
feed
us
from
a
bottle
three
times
a
day
to
give
my
mom
a
break
And
she
does
the
rest
My
mom
is
starting
to
trust
the
humans
more
because
she
realizes
they
are
here
to
help
us
grow
strong
and
healthy
She
sits
close
to
the
humans
now
and
watches
over
us
as
they
try
to
feed
all
5
of
us
with
just
two
bottles
It
can
get
a
little
messy
sometimes
Like
all
kids
though
kittens
grow
up
fast
and
our
mom
can't
take
care
of
us
forever
We
need
to
find
humans
who
love
fluffy
adorable
kittens
and
will
raise
them
as
their
own
We
promise
to
use
the
litter
box
leave
your
Christmas
ornaments
on
the
tree
and
purr
in
your
ear
every
night
Will
you
help
us
Unlike
our
mom
we
are
not
afraid
of
humans
We
love
to
cuddle
We
will
love
you
If
you
can
take
one
of
us

Uses
Last
Moments
In
Life
to
Vote
Very
little
was
missing
in
Dora
Fitzgerald's
93
years
of
life
she
had
a
marriage
of
65
years
and
family
that
spreads
generations
but
politics
was
never
a
passion
until
the
final
year
of
her
life
She
was
very
moved
for
Barack
Obama's
passion
for
fixing
things
and
his
articulate
way
of
delivering
his
message
and
she
just
decided
she
was
going
to
vote
for
him
said
her
daughter
M
Fitzgerald
She
said
I
don't
know
if
I'm
going

live
that
long
but
I
plan
on
sticking
around
to
vote
for
him
Fearful
that
November
was

long
to

her
daughter
sent
for
an
absentee
ballot
It
arrived
last
week
She
made
her
mark
and
we
put
it
in
the
envelope
my
brother
and
I
walked
to
the
mailbox
it
was
11
o'clock
Wednesday
morning
and
I
said
Mom
it's
in
the
mail
you've
done
your
thing
Barack's
going
to
win
and
she
kind
of
smiled
and
it
was
kind
of
a
deep
sigh
a
sigh
of
relief
and
in
less
than
an
hour
later
she
died
said
M
Fitzgerald
Mrs
Fitzgerald
was
born
in
1915
and
according
to
her
family
she
voted
in
19
presidential
elections.Mrs
Fitzgerald
was
born
before
American
women
had
the
right
to
vote
That
women
born
pre-suffrage
and
children
of
slaves
are
voting
in
this
election
it
really
underlines
how
immediate
that
history
still
actually
is
and
why
this
election
has
been
fucking
awesome
for
so
many
people
