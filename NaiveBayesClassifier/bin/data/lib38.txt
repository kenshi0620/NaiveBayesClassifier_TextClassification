With
the
election
just
five
days
away
a
Los
Angeles
Times
story
from
April
has
occasioned
an
interesting
journalistic
and
political
controversy
Yesterday's
L.A
Times
has
the
story
John
McCain's
presidential
campaign
Tuesday
accused
the
Los
Angeles
Times
of
intentionally
suppressing
a
videotape
it
obtained
of
a
2003
banquet
where
then-state
Sen
Barack
Obama
spoke
of
his
friendship
with
Rashid
Khalidi
a
leading
Palestinian
scholar
and
activist
The
Times
first
reported
on
the
videotape
in
an
April
2008
story
about
Obama's
ties
with
Palestinians
and
Jews
as
he
navigated
the
politics
of
Chicago
The
report
included
a
detailed
description
of
the
tape
but
the
newspaper
did
not
make
the
video
public
A
major
news
organization
is
intentionally
suppressing
information
that
could
provide
a
clearer
link
between
Barack
Obama
and
Rashid
Khalidi
said
McCain
campaign
spokesman
Michael
Goldfarb
The
election
is
one
week
away
and
it's
unfortunate
that
the
press
so
obviously
favors
Barack
Obama
that
this
campaign
must
publicly
request
that
the
Los
Angeles
Times
do
its
job--make
information
public
In
the
1970s
according
to
the
Times's
April
article
Khalidi
often
spoke
to
reporters
on
behalf
of
Yasser
Arafat's
Palestine
Liberation
Organization
In
the
early
1990s
he
advised
the
Palestinian
delegation
during
peace
negotiations
Arafat
won
a
Nobel
Peace
Prize
in
1994
The
2003
banquet
was
a
farewell
party
for
Khalidi
who
was
leaving
the
University
of
Chicago
for
Columbia
Back
in
April
we
noted
the
L.A
Times
story
the
gist
of
which
was
that
allies
of
Palestinians
hoped
Obama
was
secretly
friendly
to
them
despite
his
publicly
stated
pro-Israel
views
Here
is
what
the
Times
reported
on
the
2003
party
Speaking
to
the
crowd
Obama
reminisced
about
meals
prepared
by
Khalidi's
wife
Mona
and
conversations
that
had
challenged
his
thinking
His
many
talks
with
the
Khalidis
Obama
said
had
been
consistent
reminders
to
me
of
my
own
blind
spots
and
my
own
biases
It's
for
that
reason
that
I'm
hoping
that
for
many
years
to
come
we
continue
that
conversation--a
conversation
that
is
necessary
not
just
around
Mona
and
Rashid's
dinner
table
but
around
this
entire
world
Obama's
statement
if
taken
at
face
value
ought
to
reassure
supporters
of
Israel
What
he
was
saying
politely
was
that
he
did
not
see
eye
to
eye
with
the
Khalidis
People
with
whom
you
agree
do
not
act
as
reminders
of
your
own
blind
spots
and
biases
Yet
some
of
the
speakers
at
the
Khalidi
sendoff
were
quite
immoderate
in
expressing
their
loathing
for
the
Jewish
state
A
young
Palestinian
American
recited
a
poem
accusing
the
Israeli
government
of
terrorism
in
its
treatment
of
Palestinians
and
sharply
criticizing
U.S
support
of
Israel
If
Palestinians
cannot
secure
their
own
land
she
said
then
you
will
never
see
a
day
of
peace
One
speaker
likened
Zionist
settlers
on
the
West
Bank
to
Osama
bin
Laden
saying
both
had
been
blinded
by
ideology
The
event
was
videotaped
and
a
copy
of
the
tape
was
obtained
by
The
Times
In
a
Miami
radio
interview
yesterday
McCain
himself
weighed
in
CBS
News
reports
The
Los
Angeles
Times
refuses
to
make
that
videotape
public
McCain
said
I'm
not
in
the
business
of
talking
about
media
bias
but
what
if
there
was
a
tape
with
John
McCain
with
a
neo-Nazi
outfit
being
held
by
some
media
outlet
I
think
the
treatment
of
the
issue
would
be
slightly
different
Yet
if
an
American
politician
spoke
to
a
neo-Nazi
outfit
a
videotape
of
the
event
would
be
superfluous
The
mere
fact
of
associating
with
neo-Nazis
would
be
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
pol
in
question
had
atrocious
judgment
and
to
establish
a
very
strong
presumption
that
he
was
sympathetic
to
the
worst
sort
of
political
evil
The
meaning
of
Obama's
association
with
Khalidi
is
not
nearly
so
clear-cut
At
the
time
both
were
on
the
faculty
of
a
prestigious
university
Khalidi's
presence
there
may
speak
volumes
about
the
character
of
American
higher
education
but
Obama's
friendship
with
a
fellow
prof
says
little
about
Obama's
character
This
is
why
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
the
videotape
Were
the
belligerent
anti-Israel
comments
the
Times
quotes
typical
of
what
attendees
said
at
the
event
or
were
they
the
exception--or
did
the
paper
choose
particularly
gentle
expressions
of
hostility
In
the
last
case
especially
how
did
Obama
react
The
L.A
Times
says
it
promised
its
source
that
it
would
not
release
the
videotape
As
often
happens
in
such
cases
the
paper
is
in
the
absurd
position
of
defending
itself
for
withholding
information
while
thumping
its
chest
about
the
public's
right
to
know
The
Los
Angeles
Times
did
not
publish
the
videotape
because
it
was
provided
to
us
by
a
confidential
source
who
did
so
on
the
condition
that
we
not
release
it
said
the
newspaper's
editor
Russ
Stanton
The
Times
keeps
its
promises
to
sources
Jamie
Gold
the
newspaper's
readers
representative
said
in
a
statement
More
than
six
months
ago
the
Los
Angeles
Times
published
a
detailed
account
of
the
events
shown
on
the
videotape
The
Times
is
not
suppressing
anything
Just
the
opposite--the
L.A
Times
brought
the
matter
to
light
Some
of
our
friends
on
the
right
are
convinced
that
the
Times
is
covering
up
for
Barack
Obama
We're
inclined
toward
a
more
innocent
explanation
that
the
paper
was
caught
flat-footed
by
advances
in
technology
Twenty
years
ago
or
even
10
years
ago--that
is
before
broadband
Internet--no
one
would
have
thought
to
demand
that
a
newspaper
release
a
videotape
a
source
had
provided
it
That
the
Times's
source
thought
to
extract
such
a
promise
suggests
that
he
was
more
on
top
of
technology
than
the
reporter
he
was
dealing
with
Someone
Wants
Preconditions
Barack
Obama
has
said
he
would
meet
with
Iran's
rulers
without
preconditions
They
have
other
ideas
Reuters
reports
from
Tehran
Iran's
supreme
leader
said
on
Wednesday
Iranian
hatred
of
the
United
States
ran
deep
remarks
analysts
said
signaled
an
end
to
any
debate
about
closer
links
between
them
days
before
the
U.S
presidential
election
This
dispute
with
America
is
beyond
differences
of
opinion
on
a
few
political
issues
Supreme
Leader
Ayatollah
Ali
Khamenei
who
has
the
final
say
in
all
matters
of
state
was
quoted
by
state
TV
as
saying
He
said
the
Iranian
nation's
hate
for
America
was
deep
and
added
the
reason
for
that
was
the
different
plots
of
the
American
government
against
the
Iranian
country
and
nation
during
the
past
50
years
state
TV
reported
In
the
next
debate
someone
should
ask
Obama
if
he
is
willing
to
meet
with
preconditions--Iran's
preconditions
But
we
guess
the
chance
won't
arise
for
another
47
months
or
so
Real
Incredible
People
Back
in
the
1970s
Saturday
Night
Live
did
a
very
funny
sketch
in
which
Garrett
Morris
played
a
TV
guest
whose
hosts
introduced
him
with
wonder
as
a
man
with
very
dark
skin
The
hosts
who
were
persons
of
pallor
were
astonished
when
he
explained
that
he
knew
a
lot
of
other
black
people
too
What
was
funny
about
it
was
that
the
hosts
showed
no
hint
of
prejudice
or
suspicion
they
just
found
the
idea
of
a
person
with
dark
skin
really
neat
The
Washington
Post
has
a
story
along
similar
lines
from
Teigen
Mont
quoting
a
man
for
whose
family
the
town
is
named
I
remember
being
in
Billings
as
a
little
kid
says
Dan
Teigen
39
an
Obama
supporter
running
for
the
state
House
I
was
in
a
grocery
store
I
saw
a
black
man
and
I
said
Wow
that's
a
black
man
It
occurred
to
me
that
that
was
the
first
black
man
I'd
ever
seen
in
Montana
There
is
a
certain
kind
of
innocence
to
his
words
Which
is
part
of
the
complexity
as
you
travel
around
the
ragged
buttes
of
this
region
With
a
black
man
inching
closer
to
the
White
House
many
folks
here
just
might
have
to
grapple
with
a
situation
they've
never
faced
before
But
if
you
read
through
the
piece
it
turns
out
not
to
involve
much
grappling
at
all
Some
Montanans
admit
to
being
a
bit
prejudiced
but
the
Post
is
unable
to
find
any
who
are
averse
to
Obama
for
racial
reasons
Example
Mary
Weaver
is
about
to
sit
down
for
breakfast
at
McDonald's
She's
56
and
works
compiling
medical
records
She
says
she
is
curious
about
black
people
but
is
reduced
to
learning
about
them
from
TV
and
movies
I'm
probably
more
afraid
of
black
men
because
of
the
movies
she
says
reeling
off
examples
of
robbers
criminals
and
gang
members
It
gives
me
the
chills
I
do
make
exceptions
though
If
the
black
man
is
handsome
I
tend
not
to
think
so
badly
about
him
But
just
take
the
rappers
in
the
movies
They's
so
angry
They've
got
these
gangs
I
know
that's
not
all
black
people
but
She
trails
off
She
picks
back
up
I
had
a
nephew
though
in
a
gang
once
Of
course
he's
white
She
admits
she
has
never
had
a
black
friend
or
held
a
long
conversation
with
a
black
person
I
haven't
made
up
my
mind
about
the
election
she
says
The
subheadline
of
the
Post's
story
reads
In
the
Vastness
of
Montana
an
Overwhelmingly
White
Population
Enters
a
New
Political
Frontier
A
more
accurate
characterization
would
have
been
Montanans

So
Obama's
Race

Votes
Spam
to
the
Editors
Yesterday's
Chicago
Tribune
carries
this
letter
from
one
A
Hart
of
Forest
Park
last
item
On
my
way
to
lunch
recently
I
passed
a
homeless
guy
with
a
sign
that
read
Vote
Obama
I
need
the
money
I
laughed
In
a
restaurant
my
server
had
on
an
Obama
08
tie
Again
I
laughed
Just
imagine
the
coincidence
When
the
bill
came
I
decided
not
to
tip
the
server
and
explained
to
him
that
I
was
exploring
the
Barack-Obama-redistribution-of-wealth
concept
He
stood
there
in
disbelief
while
I
told
him
that
I
was
going
to
redistribute
his
tip
to
someone
who
I
deemed
more
in
need
the
homeless
guy
outside
The
server
angrily
stormed
from
my
sight
I
went
outside
gave
the
homeless
guy
10
and
told
him
to
thank
the
server
inside
as
I've
decided
he
could
use
the
money
more
The
homeless
guy
was
grateful
At
the
end
of
my
rather
unscientific
redistribution
experiment
I
realized
the
homeless
guy
was
grateful
for
the
money
he
did
not
earn
but
the
waiter
was
pretty
angry
that
I
gave
away
the
money
he
did
earn
even
though
the
actual
recipient
deserved
money
more
I
guess
redistribution
of
wealth
is
an
easier
thing
to
swallow
in
concept
than
in
practical
application
In
tomorrow's
Tribune
a
reporter
tells
the
harrowing
story
of
an
aviation
disaster
involving
the
pope
Bill
Clinton
Henry
Kissinger
and
an
Eagle
Scout
Homer
Nods
In
yesterday's
item
on
military
sexual
trauma
we
were
not
nearly
hard
enough
on
Reuters
As
it
turns
out
the
news
service's
numbers
don't
add
up
at
all
Nearly
15
percent
of
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
veterans
seeking
medical
care
from
the
U.S
Veterans
Affairs
Department
have
suffered
sexual
trauma
from
harassment
to
rape
researchers
reported
on
Tuesday
Most
veterans
who
were
affected
were
women
with
more
than
one
in
seven
women
seeking
health
care
services
of
some
sort
also
reporting
sexual
trauma
Just
under
1
percent
of
male
veterans
also
reported
military
sexual
trauma
One
in
seven
is
nearly
15
percent
and
the
veteran
population
skews
heavily
male
so
there
is
simply
no
way
of
reconciling
these
numbers
Possibly
the
first
paragraph
should
have
stipulated
female

Afghanistan

Barack
W
Obama
Our
item
yesterday
about
Thomas
Friedman's
outrageous
reference
to
Barack
Hussein
Obama
prompted
this
comment
from
reader
Linda
Williams
Your
reaction
to
Friedman's
comment
made
me
think
that
you
must
know
what
Sen
Obama's
middle
name
is
and
that
it
is
not
Hussein
Could
you
please
tell
me
what
it
is
I
know
it
isn't
very
important
in
the
overall
scheme
of
the
universe
but
I
have
looked
twice
on
the
Obama
Web
site
and
I've
found
no
mention
of
a
middle
name
It
seemed
to
me
that
the
most
effective
way
to
get
people
to
stop
mentioning
Hussein
would
be
to
promulgate
his
real
middle
name
At
his
Web
site
Sen
Obama
does
not
list
his
middle
name
nor
does
he
say
specifically
that
he
doesn't
have
one
If
you
have
discovered
what
it
is
you
could
do
him
and
the
rest
of
us
a
favor
by
saying
so
Even
