The
real

is
the

remains
tight

with
a
definite
edge

this

McCain
Pollster
McInturff
Overspins
Himself
by

Singer
Fri

AM

Bill
McInturff
John
McCain's
pollster
doing
a
little
spinning
I
went
on
Real
Clear
Politics
tonight
to
find
these
two
headlines
back-to-back
CBS/NYT
Obama
up
comfortably
FOX
Race
tightens
significantly
I
believe
we
live
in
a
world
much
closer
to
the
Fox
results
Nice
spin
right
The
problem
is
McInturff
doesn't
actually
believe
we
live
in
a
world
much
closer
to
the
Fox
results
or
at
least
he
didn't
until
very
recently
How
do
we
know
As
Josh
rightly
noted
earlier
today
the
partisan
balance
of
that
Fox
News
poll
McIntuff
claims
to
believe
in
appears
to
be
out
of
whack
with
just
a
2-point
spread
in
affiliation
between
the
two
parties
41
percent
Democratic
and
39
percent
Republican
Yet
just
last
month
when
McInturff
was
trying
to
spin
the
press
to
combat
another
poll
he
said
that
he
believed
the
current
partisan
balance
was
6
to
8
points
If
that
number
could
be
brought
closer
to
a
4-point
spread
McInturff
explained
McCain
would
win
No
talk
however
about
a
2-point
self-identification
spread
between
the
two
parties
Maybe
I'm
missing
something
Or
did
McInturff
overspin
this
one
Update
2008-10-31
0:55:41
by
Todd
Beeton]:Funny
looks
like
this
spin
is
in
response
to
a
memo
from
Stan
Greenberg
which
itself
was
in
response
to
some
serious
McInturff
spin
from
Tuesday
First
here
is
how
McInturff
opens
his
wishful
thinking
memo
from
the
other
day
First
let?s
be
clear
This
is
a
hard
election
to
predict
The
historic
nature
of
the
candidates
on
both
tickets
the
huge
influx
of
unregulated
money
by
the
Obama
campaign
the
dour
public
mood
and
the
unique
level
of
voter
interest
all
suggest
an
historic
level
of
turn-out
not
witnessed
in
over
40
years
Our
models/understanding
of
what
is
coming
is
therefore
necessarily
projective
but
here
is
what
we
know
for
sure
The
McCain
campaign
has
made
impressive
strides
over
the
last
week
of
tracking
The
campaign
is
functionally
tied
across
the
battleground
states
with
our
numbers
IMPROVING
sharply
over
the
last
four
tracks
Greenberg
responded
with
what
can
only
be
described
as
snarky
sincerity
All
of
us
at
Greenberg
Quinlan
Rosner
were
in
awe
of
the
boldness
of
these
assertions
as
they
we
are
sure
honestly
reflect
the
data
show
a
nuanced
use
of
language
and
topics
and
weave
a
story
that
almost
gets
to
the
conclusions
that
this
race
is
opening
up
unpredictable
and
closing
without
formally
saying
those
things
What
is
interesting
is
that
some
of
the
findings
match
ours
but
with
a
fuller
picture
take
us
to
a
different
close
Greenberg
concludes
In
our
regression
modeling
for
the
presidential
battleground
states
the
two
biggest
drivers
of
the
vote
are
who
brings
the
right
kind
of
change
and
who
is
on
your
side
Obama
enjoys
double-digit
advantages
over
McCain
on
both
with
about
53
percent
of
likely
voters
choosing
him
creating
an
upward
pressure
on
the
vote
The
structure
of
this
race
just
has
not
changed
as
we
have
moved
to
the
finish
line
As
Greenberg
notes
McCinturff
is
just
doing
his
job
but
highlighting
that
Fox
News
poll
certainly
seems
like
grasping
at
straws
and
certainly
brings
me
back
to
Josh's
question
of
whether
Fox
spun
the
straw
out
of
nothing
in
order
for
it
to
be
grasped

More
strange
scheduling
from
the
McCain-Palin
campaign
by
desmoinesdem
Thu

10:16:49
PM
EST
The
latest
Iowa
poll
from
SUSA
shows
Barack
Obama
leading
John
McCain
55
percent
to
40
percent
Obama
leads
48-46
among
men
and
61-34
among
women
Most
significantly
Obama
is
beating
McCain
by
40
points
among
the
32
percent
of
respondents
who
told
Survey
USA
they've
already
voted
Yet
Sarah
Palin
is
coming
back
to
Iowa
on
Monday
to
headline
a
rally
in
Dubuque
What's
really
weird
is
that
Dubuque
along
the
Mississippi
River
across
from
Wisconsin
and
Illinois
is
in
the
uncompetitive
first
Congressional
district
Bruce
Braley
D
It's
far
from
the
central
and
north-central
population
centers
in
the
fourth
district
where
Becky
Greenwald
is
challenging
Tom
Latham
and
farther
from
the
fifth
district
where
Rob
Hubler
is
taking
on
Steve
10
worst
King
Your
guess
is
as
good
as
mine
While
I
have
your
attention
please
kick
in
a
few
bucks
to
Becky
Greenwald
and
Rob
Hubler
so
they
can
run
more
tv
ads
during
the
final
stretch

Ad
For
Jim
Himes
by

PM

Jim
Himes
Democratic
challenger
to
my
Republican
parents
congressman
Rep
Chris
last
Republican
left
in
New
England
Shays
has
a
new
radio
ad
up
that
features
Barack
Obama
urging
a
vote
for
Himes
You
can
listen
to
it
HERE
In
it
Obama
does
more
than
just
say
I
urge
you
to
vote
for
insert
Democrat
here
he
talks
about
why
voters
should
send
Jim
to
Washington
I
need
your
help
in
electing
Jim
Himes
to
Congress
on
November
4th
If
we
want
to
change
the
way
Washington
does
business
then
we
need
to
send
the
right
people
to
Washington
Jim
Himes
is
the
son
of
a
hard
working
single
Mom
He
left
a
successful
career
in
business
to
build
environmentally
friendly
affordable
housing
He's
someone
who
will
expand
opportunity
for
all
Connecticut
families
This
is
a
particularly
big
get
for
Himes
for
a
couple
of
reasons
First
of
all
CT-04
my
old
stomping
grounds
is
a
D+5
district
Obama
is
absolutely
going
to
crush
this
district
and
pairing
Obama
and
Himes
is
crucial
for
Jim
to
win
Shays
keeps
winning
because
Democrats
and
Independents
keep
voting
for
him
Obama
is
sending
the
signal
that
that
is
not
an
option
this
year
Also
in
2006
Shays's
Democratic
challenger
went
into
election
day
with
many
polls
having
her
tied
or
winning
but
where
she
lost
it
was
with
the
anemic
turnout
among
voters
in
the
district's
largest
city
Bridgeport
We
know
that
won't
be
a
problem
this
year
at
the
presidential
level
Obama
is
doing
his
best
to
make
sure
that
the
surge
of
voters
that
turns
out
for
him
trickles
down
to
Jim
Help
Jim
keep
this
ad
on
my
parents
radio
by
contributing
to
his
campaign
HERE
For
all
his
post-partisan
language
throughout
the
campaign
Obama's
actions
have
told
a
different
story
At
every
opportunity
particularly
during
the
several
special
elections
we
had
earlier
this
year
Obama
has
exploited
his
list
and
his
online
and
off
infrastructure
to
help
the
Democratic
candidates
Barack
Obama
knows
that
the
larger
his
majority
the
larger
the
mandate
and
the
more
change
he
can
make
That's
in
part
what
this
ad
is
about
Larry
Sabato
who
recently
moved
CT-04
into
the
Leans
Dem
category
issued
his
The
Last
Word
Almost
projections
for
what
to
expect
on
Tuesday
Take
a
look
at
Sabato's
graphic
below
to
get
a
sense
of
what
sort
of
majority
and
with
it
mandate
Obama
just
might
have
beginning
in
January

Endangered
Republican
Senator
Liddy
Dole
who
is
facing
the
fight
of
her
political
life
in
North
Carolina
is
getting
hammered
for
her
scurrilous
and
over-the-top
attacks
on
her
Democratic
opponent
Kay
Hagan
Take
a
look
This
attack
by
Dole
is
totally
outside
the
bounds
of
acceptable
campaign
behavior
with
the
closest
thing
coming
to
mind
being
her
predecessor
Jesse
Helms
despicable
Hands
ad
against
Harvey
Gantt
in
1990
Faking
a
candidate's
voice
to
make
it
seem
as
though
her
opponent
said
There
is
no
God
Unacceptable
It's
time
to
fight
back
Head
over
to
the
MyDD
Road
to
60
Act
Blue
page
and
make
a
contribution
to
Hagan's
campaign
now
At
present
Hagan
has
received
172
contributions
through
the
page
for
a
total
of
about
6,000
Let's
get
that
donor
number
up
to
200
by
tomorrow
night
and
send
the
signal
that
this
type
of
baseless
mudslinging
will
not
be
tolerated
in
this
country
Make
your
contribution
today
By
the
way
We
were
at
152
donors
earlier
today
so
we're
half
way
to
the
goal
So
just
a
few

will

Campaign
Moving
into
Arizona
by

at
06:00:43
PM
EST
We
don't
yet
know
the
extent
of
the
move
but
it
is
coming
First
here's
Marc
Ambinder
passing
on
the
call
to
action
from
an
email
from
the
Obama
campaign
noting
the
tightening
polls
in
Arizona
Arizona
is
John
McCain's
home
state
He
should
have
a
comfortable
lead
with
voters
who've
known
him
for
nearly
three
decades
That
says
all
you
need
to
know
about
the
strength
of
Barack's
message
and
the
grassroots
movement
we've
built
With
Election
Day
just
5
days
away
this
surge
of
support
for
Barack
couldn't
come
at
a
better
time
But
we
have
to
act
immediately
to
take
advantage
Sign
up
right
now
to
join
our
grassroots
effort
Help
turn
out
voters
any
time
between
now
and
Election
Day
November
4th
That's
not
all
Here's
Newsweek's
Richard
Wolffe
The
campaign
is
now
seriously
examining
a
late
surge
into
the
state
That
may
include
ramping
up
TV
advertising
on-the-ground
staff
or
even
deploying
the
candidate
to
stop
there
Obama
is
scheduled
to
make
a
Western
swing
late
this
week
making
an
Arizona
visit
possible
This
is
now
the
fifth
straight
day
bringing
news
of
a
tightening
race
in
John
McCain's
home
state
of
Arizona
and
the
announcement
that
the
Obama
campaign
would
indeed
focus
on
Arizona
albeit
only
for
the
last
week
of
the
election
comes
on
the
same
day
as
two
more
nonpartisan
polls
reported
a
single-digit
spread
between
McCain
and
Barack
Obama
in
the
state

average
out
of
Arizona
shows
McCain
under
50
percent
and
leading
by
just
5.2
percentage
points
not
a
great
position
for
a
politician
who
has
spent
a
career
representing
the
state
Whether
or
not
the
Obama
campaign
does
choose
to
go
on-air
during
this
last
stretch
of
the
election
we
do
know
that
at
least
one
progressive
group
MoveOn
has
bought
ad
time
in
the
state
Here's
their
spot
I'd
still
like
to
see
the
Obama
campaign
go
ahead
and
go
up
on
the
air
in
the
state
as
well
even
with
a
modest
ad
buy
But
with
the
campaign
asking
for
volunteers
for
the
state
indicating
that
it
is
at
least
somewhat
serious
about
putting
the
state
on
the
map
and
now
MoveOn
sending
the
message
out
on
television
there
is
a
shot
a
shot
that
we
could
see
a
surprise
in
the
Grand
Canyon
state
come
Tuesday
