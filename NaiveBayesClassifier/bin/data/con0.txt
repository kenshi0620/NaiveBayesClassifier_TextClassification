Nervous
Before
One
somewhat
weird
thing
about
this
race
was
that
even
as
Obama's
national
poll
lead
held
fairly
constant
there
were
some
worrying
states
like
New
Hampshire
and
Minnesota
where
he
was
either
not
consistently
ahead
or
not
consistently
ahead
by
much
That
isn't
the
case
anymore

Mortal

One
of
McCain's
standard
stump
lines
is
something
along
the
lines
that
he's
not
afraid
of
the
fight
4
days
from
the
election
do
you
think
there's
a
single
person
in
this
country
even
among
the
mostly
stupid
undecided
voters
who
thinks
gee
I
wonder
if
John
McCain
is
afraid
of
the
fight
Our
discourse
is
so
stupid
generally
and
the
McCain
campaign
is
aiming
even

Why
Yes
You
Have
HULK
IN
DENIAL
I've
not
been
convicted
yet
Stevens
said
Thursday
in
a
meeting
with
the
editorial
board
of
the
Fairbanks
Daily
News-Miner
There's
not
a
black
mark
by
my
name
yet
until
the
appeal
is
over
and
I
am
finally
convicted
if
that
happens
If
that
happens
of
course
I'll
do
what's
right
for
Alaska
and
for
the
Senate
I
don't
anticipate
it
happening
and
until
it
happens
I
do
not
have
a
black
mark
Stevens
reiterated
that
position
during
a
televised
debate
late
Thursday
night

early
in
the
give-and-take
with
Anchorage
Mayor
Mark
Begich

Palin
I
never
thought
it
would
be
some
sort
of
mistake
to
attack
Palin
though
I
did
hold
off
until
I
had
a
better
idea
of
what
she
was
actually
like
Fortunately
she
revealed
that
rather
quickly
making
attacks
from
liberals
rather
redundant

There
is
little
doubt
that
Democrats
generally

do
well
Tuesday

if

dissatisfied

Lord
may

But
local

dissatisfaction
is

What

the

scent
of
wild-eyed
vengeance
The
fellow
is
looking
for
GOP
bodies
over
which
to
stand
The
Arizona
Republic
has
urged
District
3
voters
to
re-elect
Shadegg
As
Kos
himself
notes
Shadegg
is
the
topmost
conservative
in
the
House
But
now
we
add
another
reason
to
support
the
incumbent
Politics
isn't
or
shouldn't
be
blood
sport
Re-elect
John
Shadegg
and
give
an
out-of-state
political
barbarian
something
to
weep
about
on

DEAD
PEOPLE
ARE
VOTING
FOR

I'm
sure
the

will
try
to
invalidate
this
vote
Fearful
that
November
was
too
long
to

her
daughter
sent
for
an
absentee
ballot
It
arrived
last
week
She
made
her
mark
and
we
put
it
in
the
envelope
my
brother
and
I
walked
to
the
mailbox
it
was
11
o’clock
Wednesday
morning
and
I
said
Mom
its
in
the
mail
you’ve
done
your
thing
Barack’s
going
to
win
and
she
kind
of
smiled
and
it
was
kind
of
a
deep
sigh
a
sigh
of
relief
and
in

an
hour

Full

Credit
card
issuers
have
discovered
that
maybe
it's
sometimes
in
their
interest
to
forgive
a
portion
of
credit
card
debt
They've
realized
this
after
they
lobbied
hard
to
make
bankruptcy
a
worse
deal
for
consumers
Instead
of
declaring
bankruptcy
people
now
just
walk
away
from
their
debts
Now
they
want
the
government
to
make
it
easier
for
them
to
forgive
credit
card
debt
by
making
the
tax
treatment
of
forgiven
debt
more
generous
Bankruptcy
protection
like
limited
liability
is
there
because
the
system
doesn't
really
work
without
it
Unbalance
the

too
much

them
