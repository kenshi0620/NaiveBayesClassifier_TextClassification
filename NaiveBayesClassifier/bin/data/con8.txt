Farewell
farewell
After
a
year
and
a
half
of
blogging
it's
time
for
me
to
move
on
to
other
interests
If
you
have
tried
to
run
a
serious
issues-oriented
blog
you
will
probably
agree
that
it
takes
a
lot
of
work
mostly
in
the
form
of
time
investment
to
1
keep
such
a
blog
regularly
updated
and
2
develop
and
maintain
a
reader
base
For
me
it's
far
too
much
time
spent
on
what
is
essentially
a
hobby
Some
higher-priority
areas
of
my
life
are
pulling
me
away
from
this
hobby
and
I
do
so
without
regret
For
those
of
you
who
know
me
in
various
other
web
sites
and
e-mail
lists
I'm
happy
to
say
that
I'll
continue
to
haunt
those
places
it's
easier
to
drop
in
and
drop
out
as
circumstances
warrant
Thanks
to
those
who
helped
to
push
this
blog
to
just
over
30,000
page
loads...especially
to
those
who
actually
took
time
to
read
what
I
wrote
Some
even
had
the
nerve
to
comment
constructively
I'll
leave
the
comments
feature
open
for
maybe
another
month
and
then
I'll
make
a
decision
about
what
to
do
with
the
site
Have
a
great
2006

1993
WTC
case
highlights
the
most
egregious
shortcoming
of
our
jury
system
Remember
the
1993
World
Trade
Center
bombing
in
which
Islamist
terrorists
tried
to
topple
one
of
the
towers
into
the
other
in
the
hopes
of
killing
tens
of
thousands
of
people
The
bombing
while
it
did
not
accomplish
its
objective
was
still
quite
destructive
When
bad
things
happen
the
legal
system
immediately
swings
into
action
in
a
quest
to
find
out
who
is
reponsible
not
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
the
perpetrators
to
justice
but
for
the
purpose
of
opening
the
floodgates
for
liability
payouts
Because
of
this
it
wouldn't
do
at
all
to
pin
the
blame
for
the
bombing
on
the
terrorists
themselves
They
don't
have
any
money
So
what
to
do
Ralph
Reiland
gives
the
answer
Now
after
a
dozen
years
of
legal
maneuvering
a
jury
in
the
state
Supreme
Court
of
New
York
has
taken
the
terrorists
off
the
hook
for
the
majority
of
the
blame
in
their
1993
attack
On
October
26
unanimously
the
jury
said
the
guys
who
carried
out
the
bombing
were
only
32
percent
responsible
for
the
damages
The
majority
wrongdoer
68
percent
at
fault
for
the
death
and
destruction
said
the
jury
was
the
Port
Authority
of
New
York
and
New
Jersey
the
then-owner
of
the
World
Trade
Center
This
means
that
the
party
with
the
deepest
pockets
also
known
as
the
taxpayers
of
New
York
and
New
Jersey
will
be
picking
up
the
tab
for
most
of
the
losses
On
the
day
of
the
1993
blast
Mario
Cuomo
New
York's
governor
at
the
time
told
journalists
We
all
have
that
feeling
of
being
violated
No
foreign
people
or
force
has
ever
done
this
to
us
Until
now
we
were
invulnerable
Today
playing
Monday-morning
quarterback
more
than
a
decade
after
the
attack
the
New
York
jury
has
said
the
Port
Authority
should
have
known
an
attack
was
coming
even
if
as
Cuomo
said
nothing
like
that
had
ever
happened
before
Further
the
Port
Authority
should
have
known
to
shut
down
the
garage
to
the
public
and
to
its
upstairs
tenants
even
if
as
Cuomo
said
no
one
had
felt
vulnerable
before
to
a
foreign
force
in
the
center
of
Manhattan.This
highlights
one
of
the
greatest
shortcomings
of
our
country's
jury
system
It's
no
secret
that
jurors
are
selected
not
for
their
intelligence
or
their
reasoning
ability
but
for
the
ease
in
which
they
can
be
manipulated
by
the
prosecutor
or
the
defender
In
the
hands
of
a
competent
attorney
a
typical
jury
is

UK
bank
takes
time
to
resolve
a
customer
service
problem
I'll
give
this
bank
a
few
bonus
points
for
their
creative
solution
NATWEST
is
removing
clocks
from
its
branches
in
a
bid
to
deter
customers
from
complaining
about
how
long
they
have
to
queue
according
to
staff
at
the
bank
Getting
rid
of
wall
clocks
is
part
of
a
150m
nationwide
refurbishment
scheme
by
NatWest
which
has
more
than
10m
customers
Last
week
two
of
the
High
Street
banking
giant's
employees
said
that
during
redevelopment
of
their
branch
the
clock
disappeared
and
would
not
be
replaced
It's
been
taken
down
so
people
won't
complain
said
one
who
did
not
wish
to
be
identified
It
happened
over
a
month
ago
If
people
have
been
standing
in
a
queue
waiting
to
see
a
cashier
for
a
long
time
they
can
get
very
cross
When
the
clock
was
there
it
was
difficult
for
us
to
disagree
with
them
about
how
long
they'd
been
waiting
Now
it's
more
difficult
for
them
to
complain
I
can't
believe
it
but
it
seems
to
be
the
policy
now
Our
manager
told
us.'Clever
but
not
clever
enough
If
NatWest
wants
to
implement
this
idea
more
completely
they
need
to
collect
wristwatches
cell
phones
PDAs
etc
at
the
door

Michael
Schiavo
ready
to
rampage
through
D.C
Well
now
we
know
that
the
death
of
Terri
Schiavo
has
been
good
for
Judge
Greer's
career
but
what
about
grieving
husband
Michael
He's
been
staying
busy
and
now
he
appears
to
have
launched
the
next
phase
of
his
new
career
as
the
Culture
of
Death's
version
of
Cindy
Sheehan
Now
he's
forming
a
political
action
committee
dedicated
to
the
defeat
of
all
of
those
monsters
in
Congress
who
tried
to
keep
him
from
having
his
wife
put
down

Schiavo
judge
honored
by
local
ACLU
as
Friend
of
Civil
Liberties
Proving
yet
again
that
the
legal
culture
in
Pinellas
County
Florida
is
twisted
beyond
belief
now
we
find
out
that
the
local
chapter
of
the
ACLU
has
named
Judge
George
Greer
as
this
year's
recipient
of
its
Gardner
W
Beckett
Jr
Friend
of
Civil
Liberties
Award
The
Pinellas
County
Chapter
of
the
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
confers
this
honor
upon
individuals
who
have
demonstrated
an
outstanding
commitment
to
basic
civil
liberties
principles
and
values
inherent
in
the
Bill
of
Rights
In
the
footsteps
of
Gardner
Beckett
these
recipients
exemplify
an
unflinching
commitment
to
the
defense
of
our
constitution
and
it's
guarantees
of
equal
protection
due
process
and
simple
justice
Of
course
equal
protection
due
process
and
simple
justice
in
Terri
Schiavo's
case
involved
Greer
doing
everything
in
his
power
to
have
her
put
to
death
even
if
it
meant
doing
so
using
a
technique
banned
as
torture
by
civilized
nations
everywhere

How
shall
we
honor
a
woman
whose
misguided
philosophy
led
to
the
death
of
millions
so
far
Let's
name
a
bridge
after
her
Rachel
Carson
a
driving
force
behind
the
modern
environmental
movement
grew
up
in
a
modest
homestead
in
Springdale
Borough
near
the
Allegheny
River
For
the
budding
marine
biologist
the
river's
waters
were
an
early
inspiration
Now
more
than
four
decades
after
Ms
Carson's
death
her
presence
may
return
to
those
waters
Allegheny
County
Council
tomorrow
will
consider
renaming
the
Ninth
Street
Bridge
in
her
honor
Ms
Carson's
1962
book
Silent
Spring
criticized
the
harmful
effects
of
pesticides
sparking
a
prolonged
battle
with
the
chemical
industry
In
1970
six
years
after
Ms
Carson's
death
the
federal
government
founded
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
Two
years
later
the
government
banned
the
use
of
the
pesticide
DDT
in
the
United
States....and
in
the
thirty-plus
years
since
millions
worldwide
have
died
needlessly
from
malaria
because
of
this
junk-science
atrocity
Thanks
Rachel

The
Capitol
Christmas
Tree
returns
It's
a
small
victory
in
the
war
against
political
correctness
but

House
Speaker
Dennis
Hastert
has
told
federal
officials
that
the
lighted
decorated
tree
on
the
West
Lawn
of
the
U.S
Capitol
known
in
recent
years
as
the
Holiday
Tree
should
be
renamed
the
Capitol
Christmas
Tree
The
name
change
on
Tuesday
comes
one
day
after
the
Engelmann
spruce
was
delivered
from
New
Mexico
to
Capitol
Hill
for
decorations
and
displays
until
Jan
2
Hastert
will
light
the
tree
referred
to
as
the
People's
Tree
by
the
New
Mexico-based
committee
that
delivered
it
during
a
ceremony
on
Dec
8
The
re-named
tree
was
called
a
Christmas
Tree
until
the
late
1990s
when
it
was
changed
to
the
name
Holiday
Tree
The
source
of
the
name
change
in
the
1990s
is
unclear
but
this
year's
Web
site
could
not
be
changed
and
still
refers
to
it
as
a
holiday
tree
Calling
a
Christmas
tree
a
Christmas
tree
has
become
a
politically
charged
prospect
in
jurisdictions
across
the
country
from
Boston
to
Sacramento
and
in
dozens
of
communities
in
between
The
city
of
Boston
changed
the
name
of
its
Holiday
Tree
back
to
Christmas
Tree
after
being
threatened
with
several
lawsuits
While
the
political
correctness
has
trapped
some
communities
into
taking
the
Christianity
out
of
Christmas
in
order
to
accommodate
the
minority
of
Americans
who
don't
celebrate
the
holiday
the
White
House
continues
to
call
its
tree
a
Christmas
Tree
