Paid
for
internet
socializing
Now
this
is
an
interesting
concept
It
seems
like
most
people
I
know
have
a
Myspace
or
Facebook
page
but
they
are
fun
I
have
one
too
mostly
to
promote
my
website
I
can
across
this
today
while
surfing
and
I
thought
I'd
see
how
it
works
My
first
impression
is
that
you
have
to
wade
through
too
many
ads
to
begin
with
in
fact
that's
my
overall
impression
But
on
the
other
side
of
things
you
are
supposed
to
get
paid
I'm
wiling
to
bet
that
the
pay
off
isn't
much
don't
think
of
it
as
a
get
rich
scheme
because
it's
not
but
if
you
are
already
using
Facebook
Myspace
or
some
other
Social
networking
site
you
might
as
well
have
one
of
these
Some
of
the
benefits
I
can
see
immediately
is
that
they
will
crack
down
on
those
friend
invites
telling
us
how
lonely
we
are
or
that
friend
that
has
a
crush
on
you
You
won't
have
to
get
useless
friend
invites
It's
probably
better
even
with
the
excessive
advertising
And
even
if
it's
a
small
check
that's
better
than
nothing
I'm
going
to
try
it
out
for
a
while
at
least
I
don't
have
nothing
to
lose

Since
it's
News
Everybody
is
getting
into
the
Presidential
race
in
fact
each
announcement
is
worth
what
used
to
be
at
least
five
or
six
announcements
For
example
I've
known
for
quite
a
while
now
the
Obama
Bin
Laden
Hussien
Barack
was
going
to
run
for
President
but
hello
it's
news
again
today
But
let's
talk
about
what's
really
important
what
is
all
over
the
media
news
the
stuff
that
we
can't
get
enough
of
because
it's
just
so
damn
important
that
we
know
Who's
Anna
Nicole
Smith's
baby's
daddy
and
was
she
murdered
Well
I
can
answer
the
first
question
but
not
the
second
I'm
Anna
Nicole
Smith's
baby's
daddy
That's
right
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
it
anymore
The
great
mystery
is
solved
Don't
listen
to
the
media
about
this
because
they
don't
have
a
clue
I
understand
how
can
I
be
Anna
Nicole
Smith's
baby's
daddy
Well
that's
easy
Like
theme
parties
that
are
going
on
at
these
frats
you
know
the
MLK
party
that
raised
such
a
ruckus
Well
I
held
one
too
I
had
me
a
down
home
trailer
park
trash
party
Like
all
good
trailer
park
trash
parties
I
sent
out
my
invitations
but
nobody
showed
up
Well
almost
nobody
If
there's
ever
one
person
who
will
find
a
trailer
trash
party
it
was
Anna
Nicole
Smith
Now
don't
get
me
wrong
I
wasn't
planning
on
sleeping
with
her
because
she
was
like
a
sister
to
me
I
mean
she
was
the
only
one
who
cared
enough
to
show
up
at
my
trailer
park
trash
party
Anna
she
was
ready
to
go
She
wanted
me
bad
but
I
kept
telling
her
No
Anna
quit
touching
me
You're
like
my
sister
but
then
came
those
words
that
took
my
breathe
away
she
said
How
can
you
call
this
a
trailer
park
trash
party
if
you
won't
sleep
with
your
own
sister
So
mystery
solved
on
part
A
As
for
part
B
I
don't
know
I
don't
care
I
haven't
seen
her
in
a
while
so
it
wasn't
me
that
killed
her
if
she
was
murdered
The
only
thing
I
need
to
know
now
is
how
do
I
get
my
money
Since
I
solved
half
the
mystery
for
you
folks
can
you
please
hurry
up
and
solve
the
rest
of
the
story
so
you
can
get
back
to
the
real
news

Superbowl
XLI
SUPERBOWL
XLI
Wow
I
can't
believe
we
have
two
African
American
head
coaches
finally
in
the
superbowl
Most
people
expected
this
would
happen
sooner
or
later
and
are
not
shocked
However
many
people
are
In
fact
some
people
are
so
amazed
that
they
keep
on
talking
about
this
over
and
over
and
over
I
suppose
they
can't
get
enough
because
as
typical
liberals
usually
think
minorities
are
some
how
incompetent
and
incapable
of
playing
on
a
level
playing
field
I
guess
the
MSM
the
folks
over
at
ESPN
and
the
likes
just
always
felt
that
a
black
head
coach
just
doesn't
have
the
smarts
to
coach
a
team
to
the
Superbowl
Boy
are
they
shocked
I'll
bet
the
story
won't
end
there
It's
so
shocking
to
the
mainstream
media
that
two
black
head
coaches
are
finally
in
the
Superbowl
that
they'll
be
surprised
all
over
again
when
one
of
them
actually
wins
it
I
won't
be
unless
that
first
black
head
coach
to
win
the
Superbowl
is
Lovie
Smith
Tony
Dungy
and
the
rest
of
the
Colts

Question
for
Liberals
I
have
a
question
for
all
you
anti-war
people
out
there
It's
a
simple
question
I'll
concede
that
there
are
other
solutions
to
Iraq
all
you
have
to
do
now
is
answer
these
questions
Forget
about
Iraq
let's
say
you
anti-war
leftist
are
correct
Let's
say
that
because
of
Bush's
Blunder
there
are
thousands
no
millions
no
better
yet
billions
of
new
terrorist
all
caused
because
of
Bush's
lie
I
really
want
to
hear
from
you
leftist
on
this
subject
Question
1
A-C
Where
do
you
think
the
terrorist
are
Where
should
we
go
Are
there
any
terrorist
left
Question
2
A-C
We
get
out
of
Iraq
then
what
Will
the
terrorist
stop
fighting
against
us
If
the
terrorist
no
longer
will
fight
us
in
Iraq
does
that
mean
we
win
Since
you
know
how
we
shouldn't
fight
then
we
ought
to
be
able
to
expect
you
to
be
knowledgeable
enough
to
know
how
we
should
fight

Who
Dat
Whining
Again
Walter
Leger
a
member
of
the
Louisiana
Recovery
Board
Thar
she
blows
again
Kathleen
Blanco
her
administration
and
other
Louisiana
elected
officials
are
up
in
arms
because
Bush
failed
to
mention
Louisiana's
recovery
problems
to
the
rest
of
the
nation
last
night
Welcome
to
the
real
world
Kathleen
Actually
I
wish
Kathleen
would
come
back
to
earth
Instead
it
seems
to
me
that
she
chooses
to
live
in
a
fantasy
world
that
Bush
is
out
to
get
her
Unfortunately
for
the
people
of
the
wonderful
state
of
Louisiana
the
paranoid
Governor
is
still
trying
to
relive
the
glory
she
thought
she
gained
by
telling
the
rest
of
the
nation
how
incompetent
the
President
was
Where
has
this
Governor
been
Does
she
really
think
she's
doing
a
wonderful
job
Just
a
note
to
the
rest
of
the
nation
if
you're
thinking
about
voting
for
Hillary
Clinton
because
it's
about
time
we
had
a
woman
President
look
towards
Louisiana
for
advice
We
made
that
mistake
Many
people
voted
for
Kathleen
Blanco
because
they
felt
that
it's
about
time
we
had
a
woman
for
Governor
Casting
your
vote
based
on
gender
could
mean
that
a
woman
President
does
for
women's
future
in
the
Whitehouse
what
Kathleen
Blanco
has
done
for
women
wanting
to
serve
out
of
Baton
Rouge
That's
to
set
women
back
fifty
years
I'm
not
saying
that
Clinton
would
not
be
a
good
President
I'm
saying
look
at
Kathleen
Blanco
before
you
make
that
decision
In
fact
it
would
be
nice
to
send
Kathleen
Blanco
out
on
the
campaign
trail
with
whoever
the
Democrats
put
up
for
President
Republicans
will
win
back
the
House
and
Senate
as
well
as
retain
the
Whitehouse
But
let's
talk
about
what
Kathleen
wants
to
talk
about
that's
the
incompetence
of
President
Bush
Remember
Bush's
administration
was
too
incompetent
to
handle
hurricane
Katrina
remember
Since
he
was
so
terrible
aren't
we
better
off
without
him
helping
us
Why's
she
crying
She
should
know
how
incompetent
the
President
was
after
all
she's
the
person
who
keeps
reminding
us
how
Hurricane
Katrina
was
all
George
Bush's
fault
We
don't
need
him
what
we
need
is
a
leader
A
competent
leader
like
you
Mrs
Blanco
We
need
a
leader
who
knows
how
to
take
a
nap
while
being
overwhelmed
What
Louisiana
needs
is
a
leader
that
knows
how
to
dress
and
act
while
needing
only
an
extra
24
hours
to
think
about
it
We
need
a
Governor
that
can
in
the
midst
of
the
nation's
greatest
disaster
be
focused
on
remodeling
her
offices
That's
the
kind
of
leadership
that
speaks
of
competence
That's
the
kind
of
leadership
the
people
looks
towards
and
says
Now
why
can't
our
Governor
be
just
like
her
What
we
need
are
elected
officials
that
knows
how
to
spend
money
on
lakes
rather
than
roads
on
sugarmills
rather
than
teachers
That's
the
kind
of
officials
that
is
makes
the
rest
of
the
nation
envious
of
Louisiana
What
we
really
need
in
Louisiana
is
leaderhship
that
postspones
getting
money
to
hurricane
victims
She
wouldn't
be
delaying
the
process
to
get
the
money
out
in
time
for
her
re-election
would
she
Nah
Kathleen
Blanco
wouldn't
play
politics
everybody
plays
politics
except
for
her
Quite
frankly
I'm
sure
I'm
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
people
who
are
still
waiting
on
their
money
when
I
say
that
I
wished
Walter
Leger
would
shut
up
about
the
President
and
get
back
to
work
issuing
checks
Any
more
delays
and
the
checks
won't
be
out
before
the
election
But
back
to
the
President
So
what
if
he
doesn't
mention
Louisiana
in
the
State
of
the
Union
address
Mrs
Blanco
He's
too
incompetent
remember
In
fact
he's
so
incompetent
we
are
better
off
with
him
remember
Mrs
Blanco
Besides
the
rest
of
the
nation
has
had
problems
of
its
own
haven't
you
been
paying
attention
Most
recently
the
midwest
is
still
reeling
from
snowstorms
that
devasted
them
What
has
Louisiana
done
to
help
them
out
Mrs
Blanco
Probably
nothing
right
Really
how
has
Louisiana
stepped
up
to
assist
other
states
during
their
time
of
need
Governor
Blanco
To
be
honest
I
am
quite
happy
that
Bush
didn't
mention
the
hurricane
recovery
in
his
state
of
the
Union
address
What
good
would
it
have
done
anyway
Remind
the
nation
of
just
how
silly
the
voters
of
Louisiana
were
in
electing
Kathleen
Blanco
Remind
them
of
how
Dollar
Bill
Jefferson
was
more
interested
in
saving
documents
from
his
house
than
saving
lives
Do
we
really
want
them
thinking
about
Chocolate
city
anymore
We
ought
to
be
grateful
that
President
Bush
didn't
mention
Louisiana's
recovery
efforts
The
last
thing
Louisiana
needs
is
for
the
rest
of
the
nation
to
be
reminded
what
a
banana
republic
this
state
has
become
We
don't
need
to
remind
them
how
inept
our
Governor
is
Unfortunately
for
Louisianans
the
rest
of
the
nation
and
even
women
with
political
aspirations
our
governor
felt
the
need
to
do
so
anyway
Thanks
a
lot

The
Perfect
Gift
I've
been
struggling
lately
Really
really
struggling
Struggling
for
that
perfect
gift
to
get
for
my
friends
and
family
still
stuck
in
Liberal
politics
Then
it
hit
me
the
perfect
gift
for
any
Liberal
What
could
it
be
Why
fear
of
course
If
I
could
just
figure
out
a
way
to
bottle
fear
and
sell
it
I'd
make
a
killing
from
Liberals
I
could
sell
fear
to
conservatives
looking
for
that
perfect
gift
for
liberals
I
could
sell
fear
and
fear
lite
Fear
could
come
in
different
packages
depending
on
the
liberal
you're
giving
it
to
For
example
for
the
elder
liberals
you
can
give
them
Republicans
are
going
to
take
medicine
out
of
your
cabinets
or
if
they
already
have
a
bottle
of
that
you
could
give
them
Republicans
want
you
to
eat
dog
food
For
parents
you
can
give
them
a
six
pack
of
different
fears
1
You're
child
is
going
to
die
in
Iraq
2
Republicans
are
going
to
take
school
lunches
away
3
No
jobs
for
graduates
4
Global
warming
will
kill
your
children
5
More
middle
class
families
without
health
insurance
6
How
dangerous
are
SUV's
For
thugs
both
white
and
black
alike
you
could
get
them
A
40
ounce
bottle
of
Republicans
Hate
You
Malt
flavor
I
could
also
sell
lite
fear
and
and
call
it
20/20's
with
all
sorts
of
different
flavors
1
Earth
expect
to
be
too
hot
to
live
on
by
2020
2
Volcano
expected
to
erupt
by
2020
3
Aids
epidemic
to
reach
all
time
highs
by
2020
4
Japanese
GDP
expected
to
surpass
U.S
by
2020
5
Outsourcing
expected
to
eliminate
U.S
held
jobs
by
2020
6
California
expected
to
be
under
water
by
2020
7
Louisiana
expected
to
be
under
water
by
2020
Come
to
think
of
it
we
could
market
the
20/20's
by
individual
states
Oh
I
can
use
that
Beef
it's
what's
for
dinner
song
and
say
Fear
it's
what
Liberals
are
having
The
best
part
of
it
is
you
can
buy
fear
free
That's
right
it
won't
cost
you
a
dime
The
more
expensive
that
it
is
the
more
likely
somebody
else
will
have
to
pay
for
it
It's
a
terrific
idea
Now
I
can
finally
afford
a
multi-million
dollar
home
I
better
get
to
work
UPDATE
It's
been
an
entire
ten
minutes
since
my
epiphany
and
I
realized
that
this
is
already
being
marketed
and
is
available
now
What's
worse
it's
widely
available
For
more

the
product

Democrat
Underground

Or
you
can
just
visit
your
local
liberal
blogger
to
get
the
latest
in
fear

Liberal
Sermon
SEASON
TWO
Episode
2
Evil
Big
Cheese
First
Church
of
Democrats
Bringing
liberals
closer
to
God
since
2006
proudly
talking
liberalism
in
the
bible
belt
Worship
songs
play
There's
Salvation
in
the
Gavel
Choir
The
Gavel
on
the
Hill
Dixie
Chicks
Feelings
Matters
Most
Choir
Welcome
once
again
As
you
already
know
I
am
Sammy
Socialist
and
once
again
it's
time
for
another
liberal
sermon
to
make
you
feel
good
Just
like
our
choir
sang
just
moments
ago
feelings
matter
most
and
you
will
leave
here
today
feeling
What
a
beautiful
day
It's
been
snowing
in
Malibu
raining
in
the
desert
and
not
snowing
where
it's
supposed
to
Proof
that
there's
global
warming
Come
to
think
of
it
no
matter
what
the
weather's
doing
it's
a
great
cause
to
talk
about
global
warming
It's
beautiful
everyday
although
I
do
wish
we
could
have
hurricanes
in
Kansas
and
wipe
those
conservatives
out
In
announcements
our
missionaries
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
have
successfully
committed
7,232
acts
of
protest
against
Bush's
Islamic
Holocaust
Over
one
hundred
more
since
we
last
met
They
are
keeping
up
the
fantastic
work
lLet's
not
forget
they
did
help
us
get
back
the
House
and
Senate
we
ought
to
reward
their
efforts
by
getting
out
of
Iraq
Please
keep
the
insurgents
in
your
prayers
And
as
always
please
donate
when
the
plate
is
passed
around
Our
scientist
have
made
some
more
discoveries
about
cheese
that
you
need
to
be
aware
of
It
does
indeed
contain
DHMO
but
it
is
still
undetermined
if
it's
cancer
causing
or
not
More
importantly
eating
cheese
may
cause
constipation
Even
worse
than
that
the
Fat
Cats
in
the
big
fast
food
industry
have
been
systematically
encouraging
people
to
add
this
dangerous
and
fat
causing
product
to
their
meals
at
an
additional
price
Our
attorneys
are
now
investigating
to
see
if
they
suppressed
this
information
from
their
customers
victims
And
finally
we
have
great
news
We
have
discovered
through
research
and
panels
that
we
could
help
put
a
stop
Christian
Right
Violence
if
we
start
at
a
very
young
age
The
movement
is
beginning
in
California
by
Sister
Sally
Lieber
of
Mountain
View
Just
think
of
the
future
without
the
Christian
Right
violence
No
more
abused
children
no
more
wars
in
Iraq
no
war
for
oil
and
no
children
dying
at
the
hands
of
Republican
violence
Only
peace
We'll
now
pass
the
plate
whilst
the
children
sing
us
a
song
of
inspiration
Let
us
bow
our
head
and
pay
our
taxes
Oh
Holy
Spirit
Che
Guevara
we
thank
you
for
showing
us
the
way
that
no
man
shall
pass
through
the
gates
of
socialism
We
ask
that
you
take
away
our
dignity
as
we
say
whatever
we
need
to
say
in
order
to
be
true
to
our
liberalism
Oh
Lord
Che
strip
our
wretched
hearts
of
selfish
desires
that
would
cause
us
to
think
outside
of
your
will
Give
us
the
wisdom
to
understand
that
the
ends
of
socialism
justifies
the
means
no
matter
what
they
be
In
your
name
we
ask
From
each
according
to
his
ability
to
each
according
to
his
needs
Her
fist
wraps
the
gavel
it's
for
the
child
She
fights
it's
our
fight
don't
be
mild
Let
him
hang
let
him
hang
and
Bush
Cheney
too
Too
have
it
all
kill
Republicans
through
and
throoooouugh
Wow
don't
you
just
love
the
voices
of
children
Nobody
knows
how
to
listen
to
the
voices
of
children
better
than
the
Sisters
and
Saints
that
are
on
missionary
trips
in
the
great
Holy
land
of
Washington
DC
Sister
Nancy
Pelosi
of
Baltimore
and
Saint
Harry
Reid
of
Nevada
have
been
working
hard
to
pass
legislation
They've
passed
new
Holy
documents
in
only
forty
two
hours
That's
forty
two
hard
fought
hours
over
a
long
three
week
period
They
slaved
an
entire
42
hours
for
three
consecutive
weeks
I
know
that's
hard
for
many
of
you
to
believe
and
it
did
need
to
be
repeated
None
of
you
work
42
hours
in
three
weeks
Many
of
our
professional
daytime
talkshow
host
rarely
put
that
much
time
into
cleaning
their
own
homes
over
the
course
of
a
year
much
less
in
three
weeks
But
the
Republicans
left
the
house
in
such
a
mess
that
Sister
Nancy
Pelosi
of
Baltimore
had
to
break
out
the
whips
and
chains
to
get
the
men
to
do
anything
Oh
and
did
Sister
Nancy
Pelosi
of
Baltimore
ever
make
the
Saints
work
Let
me
tell
you
the
bigger
the
Holy
bill
the
more
moving
she
would
make
the
Saints
do
I
had
a
couple
of
the
Saints
Che
bless
their
hearts
tell
me
how
frustrated
they
were
when
it
seemed
that
Sister
Nancy
Pelosi
of
Baltimore
couldn't
decide
if
she
wanted
the
Holy
Bill
in
the
Committee
or
on
the
House
floor
to
be
voted
on
Women
some
things
never
change
Can
I
get
a
from
each
according
to
his
ability
to
each
according
to
his
needs
I
hear
some
of
you
mumbling
and
grumbling
out
there
because
you
think
I
am
talking
bad
about
women
Remember
I
am
Reverend
Sammy
Sosalist
I
am
a
liberal
so
nobody
can
criticize
me
for
being
politically
incorrect
Honour
thy
Saint
and
thy
Sister
that
thy
days
in
congress
may
be
long
upon
the
land
which
the
LORD
Che
thy
God
giveth
thee
It
is
written
in
the
ten
commandments
If
you
start
criticizing
the
Saints
and
Sisters
for
how
they
do
their
missionary
work
you
open
the
door
for
the
Republican
Demons
to
reclaim
our
Holyland
No
matter
how
much
you
disagree
with
your
Sisters
and
Saints
never
ever
criticize
them
Just
agree
with
them
Back
to
the
hard
work
that
Sister
Nancy
Pelosi
of
Baltimore
and
Saint
Harry
Reid
of
Nevada
have
been
doing
in
the
Holyland
One
of
the
key
legislations
out
there
has
been
honoring
the
work
of
the
Lord
Che
Saint
Castro
Saint
Chavez
Saint
Lenin
and
Saint
Stalin
How
were
they
so
successful
They
didn't
let
criticism
get
in
the
way
of
achieving
their
goals
They
silenced
the
opposition
Saint
Harry
Reid
of
Nevada
along
with
the
Sisters
and
Saints
of
the
Senate
have
passed
an
ethics
reform
Let
me
ask
you
folks
something
how
ethical
is
it
to
criticize
your
Saints
and
Sisters
who
are
doing
the
work
of
Lord
Che
for
the
children
How
ethical
is
it
to
prevent
our
Saints
and
Sisters
from
getting
food
to
the
mouths
of
little
children
or
medicines
to
the
elderly
Your
criticism
does
just
that
This
is
why
ethics
reform
is
so
important
and
why
we
needed
to
get
it
passed
as
soon
as
possible
George
Warmonger
Bush
hath
sent
his
demons
forth
to
keep
our
Sisters
and
Saints
from
doing
their
job
Just
as
they
did
when
Saint
Bill
Clinton
of
Arkansas
served
as
a
missionary
in
the
White
House
the
George
Warmonger
Bush
hath
sent
forth
his
demons
What
does
the
Demon
Ann
Coulter
do
besides
throw
insults
at
your
Sisters
and
Saints
Has
she
ever
done
Sure
she's
beautiful
and
I
even
heard
that
Saint
Bill
Clinton
of
Arkansas
would
love
to
spend
a
few
hours
of
quiet
time
teaching
her
about
the
glories
of
Che
but
what
hath
she
done
Hopefully
Saint
Bill
Clinton
of
Arkansas
can
shed
the
beautiful
demon
of
her
evil
armor
and
reach
deep
into
her
soul
but
the
challenge
is
so
great
Saint
Bill
Clinton
of
Arkansas
has
asked
us
to
pray
for
him
that
someday
he
might
be
able
to
do
just
that
Ann
Coulter
the
Cruel
isn't
the
only
demon
that
George
Warmonger
Bush
hath
sent
forth
Beautiful
but
extremely
demonic
minority
women
have
also
been
doing
the
work
of
George
Warmonger
Bush
It's
been
tough
fighting
them
and
we
almost
were
successful
in
reaching
into
their
arsenal
from
hell
but
we
did
accomplish
some
things
Once
we
take
out
the
lions
we'll
be
able
to
go
into
the
jungle
and
eliminate
the
rest
of
warmonger's'demons
of
war
Be
patient
we'll
take
the
rest
out
soon
Folks
it's
time
to
get
home
and
remember
the
commandments
especially
Honour
thy
Saint
and
thy
Sister
that
thy
days
in
congress
may
be
long
upon
the
land
which
the
LORD
Che
thy
God
giveth
thee
It's
important
to
understand
that
which
you
don't
agree
with
The
Sisters
and
Saints
are
working
hard
for
the
children
and
the
ends
always
justifies
the
means
If
we
tell
you
to
vote
for
a
yellow
dog
you
do
so
A
yellow
dog
is
always
better
than
a
Republican
if
that
yellow
dog
is
a
Democrat
If
you
can
vote
for
a
yellow
dog
you
can
throw
your
so
called
dignity
out
the
window
and
do
what
we
tell
you
to
do
and
say
exactly
what
we
tell
you
to
say
Let's
bow
our
head
in
prayer
Holy
Spirit
of
Che
we
bow
our
heads
to
you
this
day
to
ask
you
to
give
our
sheep
the
willingness
to
follow
your
ways
Give
them
the
wisdom
to
understand
that
if
they
must
lie
cheat
or
steal
that
it's
all
good
if
it's
in
your
name
Give
them
the
strength
and
will
to
change
their
beliefs
when
not
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
the
Sisters
and
Saints
you
have
put
before
them
Whatever
it
takes
the
ends
will
justify
your
means
Lord
Che
your
will
be
done
on
earth
it's
socialism
From
each
according
to
his
abilities
to
each
according
to
his
needs

Some
of
you
may
already
know
that
I
was
raised
in
Southeast
Colorado
and
growing
up
we'd
often
call
my
hometown
hell
More
to
the
point
the
area
was
called
Picketwire
because
of
Picketwire
Canyon
that
was
around
the
way
from
my
hometown
It
was
called
Picketwire
because
back
in
the
day
the
cowboys
would
call
it
Picketwire
instead
of
the
spanish
name
it
had
Purgatoir
Translated
from
Spanish
means
Purgatory
Now
I
don't
know
if
you
have
been
paying
much
attention
to
the
news
lately
but
if
you
have
you'd
know
that
the
midwest
has
been
getting
hammered
with
snow
My
home
town
has
frozen
over
which
means
Purgatory
froze
over
If
purgatory
froze
over
then
I
am
sure
hell
has
froze
over
