The
New
Job
First
I
am
not
one
to
go
around
hunting
for
omens
portents
or
signs
from
God
under
every
rock
but
if
this
doesn't
qualify
I
don't
know
what
does
Last
Friday
my
new
supervisor
called
me
Long
story
a
whole
lot
shorter
she
used
to
work
for
the
husband
of
a
woman
I
met
online
through
some
of
the
most
unbelievable
circumstances
you
could
imagine
For
those
in
the
know
that
woman
is
also
known
as
Mrs
ex-Perp
The
rest
of
you
don't
sweat
it
No
six
degrees
of
separation
going
on
here
And
we're
talking
about
opposite
coasts
my
new
employer
is
headquartered
in
North
Carolina
Yesterday
was
my
first
full
day
on
the
job
and
my
head
is
still
spinning
but
that's
to
be
expected
You
know
how
those
in
the
know
talk
about
how
you
must
be
very
very
circumspect
and
professional
when
using
company
e-mail
Well
yesterday
morning
a
whole
series
of
e-mails
started
popping
up
beginning
with
some
concerns
surrounding
the
fact
that
many
of
us
a
are
new
to
the
company
and
b
are
working
on
a
brand-new
account
to
boot
so
there
are
some
definite
issues
to
iron
out
In
the
midst
of
this
one
woman
made
a
reference
to
a
crabby
old
lady
Well
y'all
know
me
I
jumped
in
with
Crabby
old
lady
Did
someone
call
my
name
And
after
that
it
turned
into
a
free-for-all--in
which
the
supervisors
were
giving
just
as
much
fun
to
the
party
as
us
worker
bees
Apparently
and
I
haven't
learned
otherwise
yet
the
corporate
mentality
is
that
we
all
need
a
sanity
insanity
break
once
in
a
while
and
group
laughter
in
the
form
of
e-mails
anyway
since
we're
all
working
remotely
is
to
be
encouraged
And
then
this
morning
someone
wrote
in
that
now
she
knows
why
all
the
QA
quality
assurance
people
at
her
last
job
were
grumpy
all
of
the
ones
who
have
a
sense
of
humor
work
for
OUR
company
Meanwhile
I
am
still
getting
used
to
their
system
and
there
are
some
really
really
difficult-to-understand
ESL
doctors
whose
dictation
I
have
been
unlucky
enough
to
draw
But
I
cranked
out
marginally
more
work
today
than
yesterday
so
perhaps
I
am
speeding
up
just
a
little
We
shall
see
I
am
meeting
my
first-week
daily
production
quota
so
far
and
hopefully
will
have
sped
up
enough
by
week
2
to
meet
that
quota
and
so
forth
I
am
still
well
under
the
normal
production
quota
though
Oh
well
this
is
what
the
training
period
is
for
Is
it
time
for
my
nap
yet

A
Blast
From
The
Past
Literally
The
first
time
I
heard
this
song
on
local
radio
I
was
driving
home
pulled
up
at
a
stoplight
and
the
person
in
the
next
car
looked
over
at
me
and
quickly
looked
away
again
because
I
was
laughing
my
pinkytoe
off
and
the
tears
were
rolling
down
my
face
In
the
next
day
or
two
I
managed
to
tape-record
the
song
from
the
radio
but
at
this
point
I
have
no
idea
where
that
tape
might
be
hiding
It
had
to
be
1986
because
unless
my
brain
is
completely
gone
instead
of
just
mostly
gone
that
was
the
year
Clint
ran
for
mayor
and
put
Carmel
on
the
map
Brings
back
some
crazy
memories
that's
for
sure
Edited
to
add
That
was
a
popular
local
band
called
The
Medflys

Job-Hunting
In
the
21st
Century
I
have
not
mentioned
this
on
the
blog
until
now
because
I
really
don't
enjoy
bleeding
all
over
the
folks
who
come
here
hoping
for
a
little
entertainment
and
enlightenment
But
I've
known
since
the
middle
of
June
right
after
I
got
home
from
visiting
Kerry
in
Wisconsin
and
seeing
the
Moody
Blues
in
Waukegan
that
big
changes
were
coming
This
has
turned
into
a
very
long
post
so
I
am
putting
the
rest
of
it
below
the
fold

I
Told
You
He
Was
Psycho
Geico
that
is
He's
supposed
to
be
nocturnal
but
as
of
1:30
this
afternoon
he
had
still
not
gone
to
bed
Every
time
I
walked
past
his
cage
he
would
attack
the
side
of
the
cage
Ever
since
he
bit
me
the
first
couple
of
times
I've
kept
a
glove
next
to
the
cage
in
case
I
want
to
handle
him
when
he's
acting
sassy
So
today
I
put
on
the
glove
and
reached
for
him
He
actually
hung
onto
my
gloved
finger
while
I
went
and
got
the
camera
then
took
him
into
the
kitchen
where
the
light
is
best
for
shooting
pictures
After
several
minutes
of
trying
to
bite
through
my
finger
he
finally
figured
out
he
wasn't
getting
anywhere
and
tried
to
let
go
Then
he
discovered
that
gecko
teeth
get
caught
on
yarn
Finally
he
got
himself
disentangled
and
slumped
onto
my
hand
for
a
well-deserved
rest
I
put
him
back
in
his
cage
and
he
didn't
try
anything
else
I
hope
he
has
finally
figured
out
that
it's
waaaay
past
his
bedtime
What
a
goofball
Firefly
snaps
at
the
shadows
when
I
walk
past
her
cage
and
she
has
snapped
at
my
fingers
a
time
or
two
but
as
soon
as
she
figures
out
what
she's
snapping
at
is
not
edible
she
lets
go
immediately
and
does
not
try
again
Geico
not
so
bright
I
couldn't
believe
how
long
he
hung
onto
my
finger
today

In
The
E-Mail
I
am
now
offered
a
pet
nail
clipper
I
doubt
any
of
the
lizards
would
sit
still
to
have
their
nails
clipped
And
one
of
the
pet
stores
is
offering
a
5
off
coupon
on
my
next
order
Really
Gecko-goo
costs
3.99
Does
this
mean
they'll
give
me
the
gecko-goo
and
a
dollar
too
Uh
huh
Sure
And
I'm
Hermione
Granger
I
didn't
even
bother
clicking
through
to
see
how
much
I'd
have
to
really
spend
to
get
that
5
off
In
other
news
Samantha
wants
to
know
why
I
haven't
blogged
about
Saracuda
Mostly
because
practically
everyone
in
my
blogroll
that's
the
links
in
the
right
sidebar
for
your
flatlanders
has
commented
Copiously
fervently
and
eloquently
Rachel
has
done
a
great
job
as
usual
amongst
her
other
usual
topics
If
you
haven't
read
her
go
do
so
Immediately
I'll
still
be
here
when
you
get
back
I
promise
And
then
click
on
all
the
other
links
in
my
