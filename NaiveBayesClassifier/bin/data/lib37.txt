An
email
sent
by
Hillsborough

Republican
Party

David
Storck
has
some
local
party
supporters
claiming
it's

The

was

by
Storck
to

of

carloads
of
black
Obama
supporters
coming
from
the

city
to
cast
their
votes
for
Obama
This
is
their
chance
to
get
a
black
president
and
they
seem
to
care
little
that
he
is
at
minimum
socialist
and
probably
Marxist
in
his
core
beliefs
After
all
he
is

If
we
want
America
to
be
great
again
to
be
one
step
closer
to
the
ideals
as
detailed
in
the
Constitution
and
Declaration
of
Independence
we
must
elect
Barack
Obama
as
our
44th
president
Leadership
The
most
important
reason
to
elect
Obama
is
the
gaping
void
of
leadership
in
our
country
We
need
a
steady
had
to
right
our
ship
of
state
but
we
also
need
someone
with
knowledge
Anti-intellecutalism
has
run
rampant
in
the
Bush
years
and
it
has
been
a
disaster
from
coast
to
coast
And
without
Sen
Obama
it
would
get
worse
When
he
ran
for
the
presidency
the
first
time
at
least
George
W
Bush
had
the
decency
to
divide
the
country
after
he
was
sworn
in
At
the
same
time
when
Sen
Obama
has
been
discussing
the
vital
need
for
our
nation
to
bridge
the
divide
between
left
and
right
the
McCain/Palin
ticket
has
run
one
of
the
most
divisive
campaigns
in
U.S
history
Not
satisfied
with
slicing
and
dicing
the
country
based
on
ideology
their
campaign
has
chosen
to
ride
a
wave
of
racial
hatred
Each
of
their
rallies
since
the
convention
having
far
more
in
common
with
Klan
or
Nuremberg
rallies
than
a
traditional
American
campaign
stop
Palin
wasn't
kidding
when
she
said
she
believed
in
a
real
America
For
her
real
America
is
white
Christian
and
rural
For
McCain/Palin
their
America
simply
doesn't
include
a
black
man
on
the
east
coast
like
myself
That
is
a
fundamentally
anti-American
position
to
hold
and
it
must
be
defeated
Economics
Trickle
down
has
failed
Deregulation
has
failed
America
faces
a
recession
caused
in
part
by
conservative
ideology
run
wild
Any
shopkeeper
can
tell
you
somebody
must
mind
the
store
or
else
it
will
be
looted
Wall
Street
looted
America
and
now
is
being
rewarded
Even
worse
McCain
wants
to
cut
their
taxes
again
and
the
end
result
will
be
what
it
always
is
The
market
conspires
to
screw
the
consumers
and
often
their
own
employees
Conservative
economics
is
FAIL
Barack
Obama
believes
that
the
party
is
over
for
big
business
while
at
the
same
time
giving
a
tax
break
to
the
vast
majority
of
Americans
Even
Democratic
politicians
have
not
been
doing
that
often
enough
for
the
last
15
years
or
so
Foreign
Policy
Bomb
bomb
Iran
isn't
a
joke
It's
a
promise
from
John
McCain
More
Americans
have
been
killed
by
international
terrorism
under
this
Republican
president
Americans
have
died
in
a
war
for
no
cause
under
this
Republican
president
And
based
on
his
own
simple
misunderstanding
of
the
world
and
the
bloodthirsty
people
he
surrounds
himself
with
as
advisers
John
McCain
would
make
Bush
seem
almost
as
sane
as
his
father
was
Barack
Obama
had
the
good
sense
to
be
against
the
war
when
even
way
too
many
Democrats
didn't
His
foreign
policy
returns
to
the
tradition
of
common
sense
and
realism
We
will
fight
the
enemies
who
need
fighting
and
not
engage
in
dumb
wars
Social
Issues
The
Supreme
Court
is
already
conservative
enough
Chief
Justice
Roberts
is
very
young
We
can't
allow
the

to
become
even
more
of
a
playground
for
the
b.s
conservative

espoused

Co
A
woman's
right
to
choose
discrimination
laws
property

We

not

who
have

dipped

the
waters
of
conservatism
like
John
McCain
and

Science
Remember

John

he
would

with
The
Bush
administration
saw
our

And
McCain
would
be
worse
It
isn't
a
coincidence
that
76

support
Obama
In

past
America
has
been
blessed
with
making

choices
at

In
the
heat
of
this
election's
back
and
forth
a
lot
of
nutty
stuff
comes
over
the
transom
There
is
credible
stuff
and
stuff
that
simply
isn't
credible
Any
blogger
with
more
than
one
visitor
gets
this
stuff
and
its
up
to
he
or
she
to
choose
whether
to
go
with
it
That's
why
it's
pretty
insane
that
a
veteran
blogger
like
Kevin
Aylward
of
Wizbang
the
site
frequent
commenter
JayTea
writes
for
links
seriously
to
a
report
like
this
What
does
it
say
The
blog
Hillbuzz
has
a
comment
from
an
Obama
insider
that
weaves
a
conspiracy
about
how
Obama
has
hired
people
to
skew
polls
and
watch
blogs
and
flood
them
with
pro-Obama
comments
Now
everything
here
is
false
Clearly
This
is
the
same
blog
after
all
that
posted
phony
stories
about
the
campaign
hiring
400
bloggers
and
aided
Larry
Johnson
in
pushing
the
made-up
rant
tape
In
other
words
a
source
far
less
credible
than
the
recent
report
that
aliens
are
now
supporting
McCain
And
yet
Aylward
links
to
this
and
says
Given
the
fact
that
Obama
is
flush
with
cash
I
have
no
problem
believing
that
they're
pay
people
to
make
him
look
inevitable
Four

eight
years
of
this
Wow
UPDATE
Oh
look
Rush
Limbaugh
is

this
too
Perhaps
Rush
can
tell

about
how

Most
days
I
go
to
Subway
near
my
office
and
pick
up
a
sub
Whether
meatball
or
ham
I
always
get
Swiss
cheese
my
favorite
cheese
to
go
with
it
All
of
a
sudden
they
stopped
stocking
swiss
So
I
went
to
another
Subway
assuming
this
was
localized
to
just
the
one
store
Turns
out
Subway
has
stopped
stocking
Swiss
cheese
period
What
the
hell
Has
anyone
heard
about
this
Outrage

be

business

UPDATE
So
I
contacted
the
Subway
people
and
they
responded
this
way
In
order
to
consistently
provide
satisfaction
to
our
customers
by
offering
high
quality
food
with
exceptional
service
that
is
a
good
value
we
must
continuously
review
our
menu
and
the
ingredients
that
we
use
Occasionally
we
find
that
some
items
are
not
popular
some
have
declined
in
overall
popularity
some
are
in
short
supply
or
are
difficult
to
work
with
In
order
for
us
to
make
room
on
our
menu
and
in
our
restaurants
for
new
and
exciting
foods
we
must
sometimes
choose
to
not
offer
or
discontinue
items
from
the
national
menu
Some
locations
may
continue
to
offer
discontinued
items
as
a
local
item
We
understand
that
this
sometimes
makes
a
customer's
favorite
food
unavailable
Please
be
assured
that
there
are
still
many
other
great
tasting
items
at
your
local
SUBWAYR
restaurant
Perhaps
one
of
them
may
be
your
new
favorite
I
apologize
for
any
inconvenience
and
appreciate
you

I
don't
like
making
predictions

I
think
this
is
one
worth
making
Sen
Obama
will
win
Pennsylvania
The
right
wing
blogs
are
constantly
atwitter
about
secret
McCain
polls
showing
the
race
there
as
close
but
for
whatever
faults
state
polls
might
have
not
a
single
one
in
Pennsylvania
has
shown
a
McCain
lead
there
since
April
And
only
one
poll
has
Obama
under
50
since
September
John
McCain
will
not
win
there
no
matter
how
many
hoaxes
about
racial
violence
his
campaign
pushes
On
the
other
hand
I
think
Ohio
is
a
legit
swing
state
that
I
think
McCain
could
win
The
problem
is
unlike
2000
and
2004
the
Democrat
can
win
without
Ohio
In
fact
in
my
final
prediction
I
put
Ohio
and
Florida
in
McCain's
column
though
I
feel
Sen
Obama
has
a
shot
in
both
especially
Florida
