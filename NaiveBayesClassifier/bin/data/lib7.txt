Senator
Ensign
Show
us
the
Money
I
was
in
Reno
Nevada
yesterday
with
former
Nevada
Common
Cause
Board
Chair
Jim
Hulse
and
a
group
of
activists
who
were
calling
on
Senator
Jim
Ensign
to
explain
his
obstruction
of
a
bill
to
require
U.S
Senators
to
tell
us
who
they
are
taking
money
from
now
Watch
a
video
of
our
event
here
Currently
Senators
file
campaign
finance
disclosure
reports
on
paper
The
paper
reports
are
scanned
into
a
computer
printed
out
and
then
retyped
to
be
placed
on
the
Federal
Election
Commission
website
This
process
takes
about
four
months
and
costs
about
250,000
in
taxpayer
dollars
Senator
Ensign
has
objected
to
a
vote
on
the
bill
He
says
he
would
like
to
attach
an
amendment
that
would
require
non-profit
groups
to
disclose
their
donors
if
they
file
an
ethics
complaint
against
a
sitting
Senator
This
amendment
is
controversial
and
appears
more
to
be
a
ploy
to
prevent
the
electronic
disclosure
bill
from
passing
This
bill
had
been
held
up
by
an
anonymous
Senator
for
months
But
then
the
Senate
rules
changed
to
forbid
secret
holds
At
that
point
Senator
Ensign
stepped
up
to
offer
his
amendment
See
the
real
footage
from
the
Senate
as
Senator
Feingold
explains
the
situation
My
question
for
the
Senator
is
this
On
whose
behalf
are
you
stopping
timely
disclosure
of
campaign
finance
information
Are
there
constituents
from
Nevada
who
have
asked
him
to
block
this
bill

Ameriquest
Shows
How
Big
Money
in
Politics
Hurts
Real
People
When
I
head
home
for
the
holidays
my
relatives
sometimes
have
a
hard
time
grasping
what
I
do
as
a
reformer
and
how
that
impacts
their
daily
lives
This
year
I'll
point
them
to
a
recent
story
in
the
Seattle
Times
that
describes
how
96-year
old
Francis
Taylor
is
about
to
lose
her
home
of
more
than
40
years
when
banks
foreclose
on
loans
she
took
out
from
the
now
defunct
lender
Ameriquest
After
inventing
the
sub-prime
mortgage
industry
the
collapse
of
which
now
threatens
to
throw
the
country
into
a
recession
Ameriquest
has
gone
into
bankruptcy
and
sold
its
remnents
to
Citifinancial
The
company
settled
a
lawsuit
with
49
states
recently
for
325
million
out
of
claims
of
predatory
lending
They
also
recently
paid
a
fine
for
violating
the
do
not
call
list
Greed
has
no
bounds
certainly
not
privacy
in
your
own
home
that
they
plan
to
take
away
from
you
The
sad
thing
is
things
didn't
have
to
work
out
this
way
Years
ago
consumer
advocates
saw
the
crisis
coming
and
urged
state
governments
to
put
stricter
regulations
in
place
Today's
Sacramento
Bee
reminds
us
how
the
California
legislature
failed
to
enact
reforms
back
in
2001
Ameriquest
and
others
said
this
would
make
it
harder
for
first
time
homeowners
to
buy
their
first
abode
but
it
turns
out
that
almost
all
of
Ameriquest's
loans
went
to
existing
homeowners
many
of
whom
the
company
probably
knew
could
not
make
the
payments
and
would
end
up
losing
their
houses
But
rather
than
casting
a
skeptical
eye
toward
Ameriquest's
arguments
California
legislators
went
to
Hawaii
on
trips
financed
by
Ameriquest
They
ate
170
worth
of
cookies
supplied
by
Ameriquest
lobbyists
Common
Cause
has
documented
here
and
here
how
the
mortgage
industry
spent
millions
lobbying
Congress
and
doling
out
campaign
contributions
to
try
to
get
a
federal
law
passed
that
would
have
pre-empted
states
from
protecting
folks
like
Francis
Taylor
One
small
but
telling
part
of
the
story
is
how
Ameriquest
owner
Dawn
Arnall
bundled
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
for
president
Bush's
campaign
and
was
then
rewarded
by
being
made
ambassador
to
the
Netherlands
No
wonder
many
observers
are
saying
that
the
new
mortgage
relief
plan
announced
by
the
White
House
appears
more
aimed
at
bailing
out
the
industry
and
preventing
more
sweeping
reforms
than
at
helping
strapped
homeowners
The
good
news
is
that
there
are
things
we
can
do
to
make
this
better
Congress
to
its
credit
recently
enacted
ethics
legislation
to
cut
down
on
lobbyist
funded
trips
California
legislators
could
do
the
same
but
it
would
mean
giving
up
those
nice
cookies
in
Hawaii
Even
more
significantly
congress
and
the
states
could
enact
full
public
financing
of
campaigns
as
several
states
have
now
done
That
would
mean
that
politicians
wouldn't
have
their
hands
outstretched
to
take
campaign
cash
from
the
mortgage
industry
Had
they
done
so
a
decade
ago
Francis
Taylor
might
still
have
her
house
and
the
house
you
live
in
might
now
be
going
down
in
value
as
the
entire
county's
real-estate
market
goes
down
the
tubes
All
too
often
business
groups
fight
political
reforms
that
would
weaken
their
grip
on
decisionmakers
But
as
the
Ameriquest
and
others
like
Enron
who
have
gone
before
them
not
to
mention
the
whole
Savings
and
Loan
crisis
remember
that
when
greed
goes
unchecked
by
a
government
that
looks
out
for
the
common
good
we
all
wind
up
suffering

I
could
not
make
this
up
if
I
tried
Yesterday
the
Public
Policy
Institute
of
California
PPIC
hosted
a
panel
discussion
among
former
and
current
elected
officials
in
California
The
topic
was
how
to
improve
public
confidence
in
the
legislature
The
PPIC
has
found
in
recent
surveys
that
only
34
percent
of
Californians
approve
of
the
legislature's
performance
Former
Senate
leader
John
Burton
said
that
the
problem
was
that
politicians
don't
really
get
to
know
each
other
As
reported
in
the
Sacramento
Bee
he
told
a
story
about
he
and
another
member
bonded
while
eating
diner
at
a
lobbyist
sponsored
event
and
watching
a
topless
dancer
These
opportunities
came
to
an
end
upon
passage
of
a
reform
measure
that
prevented
lobbyists
from
spending
more
than
10
per
month
wining
and
dining
legislators
You
find
out
your
kid
plays
Little
League
baseball
you
find
out
that
your
daughter's
in
ballet
you
find
out
you
have
things
in
common
Burton
said
But
then
something
called
Proposition
9
came
in
and
said
nobody
could
buy
anybody
anything
more
than
10
per
month
per
person."Former
Governor
Pete
Wilson
said
that
legislators
don't
get
along
well
because
they
are
too
sober
It
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
when
John
Willie
and
I
were
all
in
the
Assembly
there
was
a
great
deal
more
drinking
in
the
Legislature
Former
Assembly
Leader
Willie
Brown
said
that
the
problem
is
with
reforms
that
put
an
end
to
backroom
deals
and
made
government
more
open
and
accountable
Unfortunately
much
of
that
is
done
now
where
everybody
in
the
world
can
see
Brown
said
When
Randy
Collier
was
the
chair
of
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
and
I
served
as
the
chair
of
Ways
and
Means
we
had
a
private
arrangement
of
the
conference
committee
writing
the
budget
Some
would
say
reforms
set
in
the
early
70s
where
they
started
requiring
open
conference
committees
where
they
started
requiring
recorded
votes
where
they
started
requiring
a
number
of
things
that
inhibits
good
judgment
he
added
The
results
were
that
you
now
had
this
clear
and
present
danger
out
there
trying
to
operate
and
produce
a
result
where
every
member
is
trying
his
or
her
best
to
protect
his
or
her
relationship
with
his
or
her
constituency
and
the
results
were
stalemate
or
gridlock
Imagine
that
Legislators
are
more
concerned
about
protecting
their
relationships
with
their
constituents
than
they
are
at
cutting
back
room
deals
with
other
politicians
over
a
drink
and
a
cigar
It
may
be
true
that
one
reason
for
public
dissatisfaction
with
the
California
legislature
as
well
as
Congress
is
that
nothing
seems
to
get
done
other
than
partisan
bickering
It
might
even
be
the
case
that
when
exposed
to
the
glare
of
sunshine
legislators
are
less
likely
to
cut
compromises
that
might
sell
their
constituents
short
and
that
this
leads
to
more
gridlock
But
the
solution
to
gridlock
is
not
to
allow
lobbyists
to
grease
the
skids
for
special
interest
legislation
to
flow
more
easily
It
is
to
create
an
elections
process
that
allows
voters
to
remove
legislators
who
can't
get
things
done
rather
than
further
insulating
them
Former
Assemblymember
Jim
Brulte
had
a
better
idea
Wouldn't
it
improve
the
legislatures
standing
with
the
public
if
they
gave
up
the
self-interested
task
of
drawing
their
own
political
districts
That
would
be
one
step
toward
a
more
functional
legislature

Independent
Expenditures
Explode
Over
the
past
year
California
has
seen
a
tremendous
increase
in
so-called
political
independent
expenditures
This
is
where
a
powerful
donor
spends
money
to
praise
or
trash
a
candidate
with
their
own
ads
or
mailings
rather
than
giving
a
contribution
to
the
candidate
to
spend
as
they
wish
This
rise
in
independent
spending
is
in
part
a
reaction
by
donors
to
recently
implemented
limits
on
how
much
they
can
give
a
candidate
directly
However
some
of
the
independent
expenditures
we're
now
seeing
dwarf
the
amounts
that
donors
used
to
give
to
candidates
even
when
there
were
no
restrictions
in
place
I've
been
asked
to
testify
about
independent
expenditures
before
the
California
Assembly
Elections
Committee
on
September
12
You
can
read
my
complete
testimony
here
but
this
is
a
brief
overview
of
what
I'll
be
saying
The
underlying
concept
of
one
person
one
vote
that
promises
political
equality
and
gives
legitimacy
to
majority
rule
is
threatened
when
a
few
donors
fund
massive
independent
expenditures
The
U.S
Constitution's
guarantee
of
a
republican
form
of
government
erodes
when
elected
representatives
are
accountable
to
a
relatively
small
number
of
narrow
interests
as
opposed
to
the
public
at
large
If
a
handful
of
people
have
a
louder
voice
than
the
rest
of
us
then
the
electorate
does
not
have
the
balanced
information
from
all
perspectives
that
it
needs
to
make
an
informed
decision
and
the
goals
of
the
First
Amendment
are
undermined
Some
examples
1
Independent
expenditures
allow
a
few
fat
cats
to
unduly
influence
election
outcomes
In
the
2006
primary
election
for
governor
developer
Angelo
Tsakopoulos
and
his
family
contributed
8.7
million
to
a
committee
set
up
by
the
firefighters
union
called
Californians
for
a
Better
Government
This
committee
then
ran
ads
that
expressly
promoted
Phil
Angelides
for
governor
It
is
likely
that
this
expenditure
played
a
decisive
outcome
in
the
race
2
Because
large
expenditures
unduly
influence
elections
they
also
unduly
influence
legislation
Also
in
the
2006
primary
election
car
dealers
financed
an
independent
expenditure
campaign
to
promote
Alex
Padilla
for
the
California
Senate
Mr
Padilla
was
running
against
Cindy
Montanez
who
as
an
Assemblymember
had
sponsored
a
car
buyers
bill
of
rights
that
gave
consumers
two
days
time
to
return
used
car
The
car
dealers
thus
identified
Ms
Montanez
as
detrimental
to
their
financial
self-interest
and
spent
at
least
122,000
to
promote
her
opponent
While
the
legislature
may
occasionally
do
stupid
things
legislators
themselves
are
not
stupid
people
Legislators
are
smart
enough
I
submit
to
figure
out
that
if
they
too
stand
up
to
the
car
dealers
that
they
might
fall
victim
to
a
large
independent
expenditure
in
a
future
election
Interestingly
enough
as
the
2006
legislative
session
ended
Senator
Torlakson
gutted
a
bill
that
had
previously
dealt
with
air
quality
issues
and
replaced
it
with
a
last
minute
increase
in
vehicle
document
preparation
fee
that
car
dealers
charge
customers
from
45
to
55
This
favor
to
the
car
dealers
is
like
raising
the
car
tax
by
10
only
the
money
doesn't
even
go
to
the
state
to
cover
public
expenses
but
instead
goes
into
private
interests
bank
accounts
3
Because
large
expenditures
unduly
influence
elections
they
can
also
unduly
influence
other
government
decisions
This
summer
while
they
were
negotiating
a
contract
with
Governor
Schwarzenegger
the
prison
guards
union
publicly
announced
that
it
might
spend
10
million
on
independent
expenditures
to
influence
the
upcoming
governor's
election
Governor
Schwarzenegger
knows
that
the
guards
track
record
of
damaging
Diane
Feinstein
and
aiding
Gray
Davis
in
previous
elections
demonstrates
that
they
are
a
powerful
interest
This
threat
of
an
independent
expenditure
completely
undermines
Governor
Schwarzenegger's
pledge
not
to
accept
contributions
from
public
employee
unions
that
he
is
negotiating
with
4
Because
corporations
can
make
large
expenditures
to
unduly
influence
elections
they
give
inappropriate
political
advantage
to
citizens
who
organize
their
interests
through
business
corporations
This
spring
the
U.S
Chamber
of
Commerce
financed
ads
that
promoted
Arnold
Schwarzenegger's
accomplishments
as
governor
Because
these
ads
avoided
the
magic
words
of
telling
viewers
to
vote
for
Schwarzenegger
the
Chamber
did
not
have
to
disclose
the
funding
sources
although
clearly
the
Chamber
relies
heavily
on
contributions
from
business
corporations
Some
media
reports
estimate
10
million
was
spent
It
is
wholly
appropriate
for
citizens
who
want
to
support
a
pro-business
regulatory
climate
in
California
to
make
political
contributions
as
individuals
and
to
form
political
associations
and
organizations
to
pool
their
contributions
together
But
it
is
inappropriate
for
these
individuals
to
make
contributions
or
expenditures
to
influence
elections
using
money
from
the
corporate
treasury
which
comes
from
customers
who
are
making
an
economic
purchase
from
the
corporation
but
who
do
not
necessarily
support
the
corporation's
political
agenda
Fortunately
there
are
several
options
available
to
California
to
deal
with
these
problems
of
massive
independent
expenditures
1
Repeal
contribution
limits
for
candidates
This
non-solution
tends
to
be
a
favorite
approachy
among
many
officeholders
who
would
much
prefer
to
have
big
money
flowing
into
their
own
campaigns
instead
of
independent
committees
who
they
cannot
control
Even
when
a
committee
is
trying
to
help
a
candidate
their
message
and
tactics
may
not
fit
well
within
the
overall
strategy
of
a
candidate
and
may
in
fact
be
counter-productive
Plus
it's
just
downright
uncomfortable
to
have
other
folks
out
there
talking
about
you
But
some
discomfort
is
par
for
the
course
when
you
offer
yourself
for
public
service
It's
a
noble
act
to
be
willing
to
serve
but
even
nobler
to
have
the
confidence
that
voters
will
support
you
even
when
critics
assail
you
through
independent
expenditures
Raising
or
eliminating
contribution
limits
to
candidates
is
akin
to
having
the
state
start
selling
crystal
meth
at
a
discount
in
order
to
prevent
private
drug
dealers
from
selling
it
The
donor
influence
is
still
there
both
on
election
outcomes
and
on
legislation
only
it
is
more
corrosive
and
less
obvious
2
Ban
corporate
independent
expenditures
For
the
last
century
federal
law
has
banned
corporate
contributions
to
federal
candidates
It
is
high
time
that
California
caught
up
with
this
basic
reform
Courts
have
long
upheld
these
rules
Further
in
the
case
Austin
v
Michigan
Chamber
of
Commerce
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
upheld
a
complete
ban
on
independent
expenditures
by
corporations
precisely
because
they
can
accumulate
vast
sums
of
wealth
that
bear
no
relation
to
political
support
for
the
corporations
ideas
Proposition
89
on
this
November's
ballot
would
ban
corporate
expenditures
to
independent
campaigns
to
1000
3
Place
similar
contribution
limits
on
independent
committees
as
exist
for
candidate
committees
California's
current
system
of
unlimited
contributions
to
independent
committees
is
an
open
invitation
to
evade
the
candidate
contribution
limits
Federal
law
applies
a
5000
limit
on
contributions
to
a
political
action
committee
that
conducts
independent
expenditures
Congress
is
currently
considering
legislation
that
would
extend
these
limits
to
so-called
527
committees
that
promote
support
attack
or
oppose
candidates
but
currently
accept
unlimited
individual
contributions
Congress
has
already
required
these
committees
to
disclose
their
donors
and
banned
corporations
from
funding
TV
ads
that
attack
or
promote
candidates
near
elections
even
if
they
fall
short
of
an
independent
expenditure
While
California
is
leading
the
country
in
tackling
global
warming
and
other
issues
we
are
embarrassingly
far
behind
the
federal
government
and
other
states
in
dealing
with
this
problem
of
independent
expenditures
Prop
89
would
place
a
1000
limit
on
contributions
to
independent
expenditure
committees
4
Provide
public
funds
to
match
independent
expenditures
Disclosure
contribution
limits
and
corporate
bans
would
go
a
long
way
toward
reducing
the
undue
influence
of
big-money
independent
electioneering
But
they
would
not
eliminate
the
problem
Just
as
current
court
rulings
allow
a
wealthy
individual
to
spend
an
unlimited
amount
on
their
own
candidacy
they
also
allow
a
wealthy
individual
to
spend
an
unlimited
amount
on
their
own
independent
expenditure
So
California
could
prevent
Angelo
Tsakopoulos
from
making
a
large
contribution
to
the
firefighters
independent
committee
but
it
could
not
prevent
Tsakopolous
or
anyone
else
from
unlimited
spending
as
an
individual
and
unduly
influencing
election
outcomes
California
could
make
things
more
fair
by
ensuring
that
candidates
who
are
targeted
by
massive
independent
expenditures
can
respond
This
session
the
Assembly
wisely
passed
AB
583
which
would
have
provided
candidates
who
entered
a
binding
system
to
accept
no
private
contributions
would
receive
a
limited
amount
of
public
funds
to
respond
to
independent
expenditures
that
attacked
them
or
promoted
their
opponent
Think
of
it
as
opening
a
free
methadone
clinic
next
to
every
drug
dealer
Unfortunately
the
Senate
did
not
consider
the
bill
Proposition
89
contains
similar
provisions
for
matching
funds
and
offers
an
immediate
and
workable
solution
to
the
challenges
posed
to
democracy
of
large
independent
expenditures

California
Welcomes
Future
Abramoff
Scandals
The
Los
Angeles
Times
gets
kudos
for
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
the
California
legislature
as
it
conducted
all
sorts
of
mischief
in
the
final
hours
of
the
legislative
session
last
week
This
story
details
a
bill
pushed
through
after
midnight
on
the
last
day
of
business
that
will
allow
politicians
to
raise
money
from
lobbyists
and
other
interests
for
so-called
officeholder
expenses
accounts
An
officeholder
expense
account
is
basically
a
slush
fund
that
a
politician
can
use
to
travel
eat
fancy
dinners
give
gifts
or
make
contributions
to
charities
in
their
district
that
will
make
them
more
popular
people
If
these
things
were
truly
necessary
to
do
their
jobs
they
could
ask
their
employer
that's
us
the
voters
to
pay
the
tab
But
instead
they
want
to
hit
up
special
interests
for
yet
more
cash
to
cover
the
bill
Here
is
a
link
to
the
summary
of
the
bill
which
includes
links
to
the
legislators
who
voted
to
give
themselves
this
privilidge
it
passed
the
Senate
36-0
This
bill
amends
the
California
Political
Reform
Act
the
basic
rules
for
money
in
CA
politics
Prop
34
which
passed
in
2000
amended
the
PRA
to
say
this
about
campaign
contributions
raised
after
a
campaign
is
over
85316
Receipt
of
Contributions
After
the
Date
of
the
Election
A
contribution
for
an
election
may
be
accepted
by
a
candidate
for
elective
state
office
after
the
date
of
the
election
only
to
the
extent
that
the
contribution
does
not
exceed
net
debts
outstanding
from
the
election
and
the
contribution
does
not
otherwise
exceed
the
applicable
contribution
limit
for
that
election
This
little
piece
of
law
effectively
prohibits
officeholders
from
continuing
to
raise
campaign
money
once
in
office
Now
most
politicians
get
around
this
by
starting
a
new
campaign
to
run
for
re-election
immediately
after
winding
up
their
old
campaign
This
means
that
they
get
to
keep
raising
money
round
the
clock
and
can
keep
using
their
campaign
account
for
travel
and
meal
perks
if
they
want
to
But
if
you
are
a
termed
out
politicians
like
Kevin
Murray
who
sponsored
this
bill
you
can't
just
run
for
re-election
so
it's
harder
to
keep
raising
your
slush
fund
The
right
solution
would
be
to
prohibit
all
officeholders
not
just
termed
out
ones
from
raising
slush
fund
money
Really
we
should
prohibit
them
from
raising
any
money
at
all
until
the
year
of
the
election
there's
just
no
need
for
permanent
campaigns
Instead
the
legislature
opted
to
let
all
politicians
even
termed
out
ones
raise
money
for
expenses
that
are
questionable
at
best
Powerlobbyist
Jack
Abramoff
got
himself
into
trouble
for
among
other
things
illegally
arranging
travel
junkets
for
members
of
congress
Abramoff
also
used
a
restaraunt
he
owned
to
wine
and
dine
politicians
California
may
make
it
easier
for
the
future
Abramoff's
of
the
world
They'll
simply
be
able
to
cut
a
politician
a
check
which
can
then
be
used
for
travel
and
meal
perks
at
the
legisltors

Dodging
Disclosure
Reporter
Brian
Joseph
of
the
Orange
County
Register
has
uncovered
a
disturbing
trend
politicians
are
now
routinely
accepting
pledges
for
contributions
at
their
fundraising
event
rather
than
demanding
checks
ahead
of
time
to
come
in
the
door
see
his
story
here
What's
the
problem
you
ask
Well
this
in-effect
creates
a
system
where
donors
can
signal
their
support
for
a
legislator
but
wait
to
hand
over
the
check
until
later
This
creates
two
potentially
troubling
situations
1
At
a
minimum
this
arrangement
delays
disclosure
of
the
contribution
California
law
has
among
the
tightest
disclosure
requirements
in
the
country
All
large
contributions
must
be
reported
within
24
hours
of
receiving
them
once
you
are
within
90
days
of
an
election
But
neither
the
politician
nor
the
donor
has
to
report
the
pledge
As
we
are
nearing
the
end
of
the
California
legislative
session
special
interest
swindles
are
thick
in
the
air
So
are
political
fundraisers
But
it
becomes
impossible
to
track
which
lobbyists
are
giving
contributions
to
legislators
at
the
same
time
they
are
asking
those
legislators
for
special
treatment
for
their
clients
because
the
check
will
come
in
long
after
the
session
is
over
2
This
secondary
market
of
pledges
instead
of
checks
actually
creates
a
system
where
the
donor
can
wait
to
see
if
a
legislator
does
what
they
want
before
they
make
good
on
their
pledge
A
politician
can
figure
out
how
they
should
vote
on
an
issue
by
hosting
a
fundraiser
seeing
who
makes
pledges
possibly
among
competing
interests
and
then
quickly
calculate
what
position
would
earn
them
the
most
campaign
cash
All
this
can
happen
mind
you
without
any
explicit
agreement
by
donor
or
politician
to
exchange
a
vote
for
a
contribution
The
practice
highlights
one
of
the
weaknesses
of
relying
upon
disclosure
as
a
way
to
combat
corruption
from
campaign
contributions
The
disclosure
model
presumes
that
large
contributions
can
be
corrupting
and
that
the
best
way
to
guard
against
this
is
to
require
all
contributions
to
be
reported
so
that
the
media
and
the
public
can
then
see
if
there
are
any
connections
between
donors
and
actions
by
legislators
Setting
aside
the
impracticality
of
monitoring
these
conflicts
among
thousands
of
donors
and
thousands
of
legislative
acts
this
pledge
system
shows
how
easy
it
is
to
evade
disclosure
laws
The
better
solution
is
to
set
tougher
limits
on
what
big
donors
can
give
to
politicians
Better
yet
would
be
to
provide
candidates
a
system
where
by
they
would
be
prohibited
from
accepting
any
contributions
if
they
instead
agreed
to
a
rigid
system
of
public
financing
for
their
campaigns
Opponents
of
these
hard-hitting
campaign
finance
reforms
often
argue
that
they
can
undermine
disclosure
because
donors
seek
other
ways
of
helping
politicians
rather
than
giving
them
money
directly
For
instance
donors
give
money
to
bogus
front
groups
which
run
ads
praising
or
trashing
a
candidate
but
don't
actually
contribute
to
them
The
solution
of
course
is
to
require
similar
disclosure
and
limits
on
those
front
groups
But
as
this
example
shows
donors
can
find
may
ways
to
avoid
disclosure
even
absent
tough
limits
on
contributions
Bottom
line
if
disclosure
is
effective
in
its
own
right
fat
cats
will
dodge
it
to
then
ruin
its
effectiveness

Reform
Measure
Passes
in
Alaska
On
Tuesday
August
22
voters
in
Alaska
overwhelmingly
approved
a
campaign
finance
ballot
measure
With
87
of
the
precincts
reporting
Measure
1
had
support
from
74
of
the
voters
click
here
for
updated
results
This
article
has
more
details
on
the
measure
This
measure
lowers
contribution
limits
to
candidates
from
1000
to
500
and
tightens
the
rules
on
who
must
register
as
a
lobbyist
The
effort
was
led
by
Alaska
PIRG
in
response
to
the
legislature's
recent
move
to
increase
these
limits
The
Alaska
legislature
had
enacted
the
500
contribution
limit
after
AKPIRG
and
other
reformers
had
gathered
enough
signatures
to
place
an
initiative
on
the
ballot
in
1996
Governor
Frank
Murkowski
introduced
and
then
signed
a
law
in
2003
to
double
those
limits
Measure
1's
passage
reverses
that
Interestingly
voters
also
canned
Frank
Murkowski
as
Governor
He
had
come
under
heavy
criticism
for
appointing
his
daughter
as
U.S
Senator
when
he
vacated
that
post
to
become
Governor
in
2002
This
may
be
a
sign
of
things
to
come
There
are
reform
measures
on
the
ballot
in
California
Prop
89
to
enact
public
financing
and
tighten
limits
on
private
contributions
Oregon
Measures
47
and
48
to
amend
the
Oregon
Constitution
to
allow
for
contribution
and
spending
limits
and
then
enact
a
tough
set
of
limits
and
Colorado
to
tighten
ethics
laws
and
ban
gifts
from
lobbyists
to
legislators
Likewise
other
incumbents
have
been
losing
in
primaries
including
Joe
Lieberman
in
Connecticut
Cynthia
McKinney
in
Georgia
and
Joe
Schwarz
in
Michigan
Voters
may
be
in
a
mood
to
clean
house

Cunningham
Scandal
Rep
Harris
Under
Investigation
Guilty
Plea
From
MZM
Employee
As
Jim
Stratton
reported
last
week
in
the
Orlando
Sentinel
federal
investigators
recently
questioned
the
former
top
political
aide
to
Florida
Congresswoman
Katherine
Harris
about
her
relationship
with
defense
contractor
Mitch
Wade
one
of
the
men
who
bribed
former
congressman
Duke
Cunningham
The
report
signals
that
the
federal
investigation
into
the
aftermath
of
the
Duke
Cunningham
scandal
has
turned
its
sights
on
Harris
Duke
Cunningham's
guilty
plea
to
bribery
and
other
charges
last
November
signaled
the
beginning
not
end
of
a
widespread
federal
investigation
into
possible
corruption
by
members
of
Congress
and
government
contractors
As
prosecutors
delved
into
the
dealings
of
the
men
who
bribed
Cunningham
several
aspects
of
their
relationships
with
other
members
of
Congress
emerged
which
were
eerily
similar
to
their
relationship
with
Cunningham
including
massive
campaign
contributions
from
the
contractors
to
the
congressmembers
and
congressional
earmarks
from
the
members
to
the
government
contractors
One
such
member
was
Katherine
Harris
At
the
time
he
pleaded
guilty
to
bribery
and
corruption
charges
this
past
February
Wade
also
pleaded
guilty
to
making
illegal
campaign
contributions
to
Rep
Harris
and
Virginia
Congressman
Virgil
Wade
Wade
and
his
employees
had
given
50,000
to
Harris
32,000
of
which
Wade
illegally
funneled
through
his
employees
to
skirt
federal
contribution
limits
Just
as
Cunningham
rewarded
Wade
and
fellow
defense
contractor
Brent
Wilkes
for
their
campaign
contributions
and
outright
bribery
Harris
had
attempted
to
earmark
10
million
for
Wade's
company
MZM
At
one
point
Wade
and
Harris
had
dinner
in
a
posh
D.C
restaurant
At
the
dinner
Wade
offered
to
host
a
fundraiser
for
Harris's
campaign
for
U.S
Senate
This
on
top
of
the
50k
she'd
already
received
from
MZM
A
few
weeks
later
Harris
amended
the
list
of
earmarks
she
had
requested
from
House
leadership
to
include
the
10
million
for
Wade
The
quid
pro
quo
nature
of
the
Wade/Harris
dealings
raised
the
strong
possibility
of
bribery
Harris's
explanation
of
these
circumstances
to
her
staff
was
so
changing
and
inconsistent
that
many
members
of
her
staff
resigned
One
such
staffer
top
political
strategist
Ed
Rollins
thought
the
circumstances
sufficiently
damning
to
recommend
that
Harris
get
a
lawyer
Rollins
was
the
subject
of
the
federal
interview
mentioned
earlier
Rollins
a
longtime
GOP
operative
said
he
assumed
more
interviews
with
other
Harris
staffers
would
be
forthcoming
In
related
news
Richard
Berglund
a
former
employee
for
Mitch
Wade
at
his
defense
contracting
firm
MZM
pleaded
guilty
last
Friday
to
making
illegal
campaign
contributions
to
Harris
as
reported
in
the
St
Petersburg
Times
In
short
the
Cunningham
fallout
has
only
just
begun
Three
of
the
four
co-conspirators
named
by
both
Cunningham
and
Wade
in
their
guilty
pleas
remain
unindicted
including
big
kahuna
Brent
Wilkes
Nor
is
Harris
the
sole
member
of
Congress
who
received
50,000
or
more
in
campaign
contributions
from
Wade
and
Wilkes
while
steering
them
various
government
contracts
worth
tens
of
millions
In
addition
to
Harris
and
Cunningham
other
members
of
this
group
include
Virgil
Goode
VA
Jerry
Lewis
CA
Duncan
Hunter
CA
and
John
Doolittle
CA
Doolittle
alone
received
upwards
of
130,000
from
Wilkes
and
his
associates
in
turn
steering
37
million
in
federal
tax
dollars
to
Wilkes
company

Yes

Many
of
the

So

In

11,000

years

property
Check

the

The
office
in
question
is
a
house
in
East
Nashville
Other
than
being
owned
by
Rep
Pruitt
it
has
very
little
going
for
it
in
the
way
of
being
a
campaign
office
it
is
boarded-up
the
electricity
is
shut
off
and
neighbors
say
they
never
see
any
activity
Abandoned
in
other
words
If
Pruitt
was
paying
fair
market
value
for
legitimate
campaign
expenses
that
would
be
legal
But
from
all
appearances
Ms
Pruitt's
payments
to
herself
are
neither
fair
market
value
for
the
house
nor
are
for
a
legitimate
campaign
expense
She
is
using
her
position
as
public
servant
to
line
her
own
pocket
600
miles
and
a
level
of
government
away
another
politician
is
engaged
in
the
same
brand
of
ethically
questionable
and
possibly
illegal
self-enrichment
As
Jonathan
Weisman
and
Jeffrey
Birnbaum
report
in
the
Washington
Post
Congressman
John
Doolittle
has
paid
his
wife
some
170,000
from
his
federal
political
committees
over
the
last
several
years
for
fundraising
Just
as
it
is
in
Tennessee
with
state
Rep
Pruitt
such
an
arrangement
is
allowed
if
Mrs
Doolittle
is
being
paid
fair
market
value
for
legitimate
campaign
expenses
Otherwise
big
political
donors
could
steer
money
into
the
bank
accounts
of
officeholders
essentially
putting
people
that
are
supposed
to
be
public
servants
on
their
private
payroll
Fundraising
seems
a
legitimate
campaign
expense
so
the
question
is
whether
Julie
Doolittle
is
getting
paid
fair
market
value
It
doesn't
look
like
it
The
Doolittle
arrangement
pays
Mrs
Doolittle
15
of
every
donation
received
by
Doolittle's
PAC
Only
one
other
member
of
Congress
New
York
Congressman
John
Sweeney
pays
a
family
member
on
commission
for
campaign
work
and
Sweeney
pays
10
which
Sweeney's
spokesperson
insists
is
standard
in
the
industry
A
national
association
of
fundraisers
has
also
said
the
Doolittle
arrangement
violates
its
ethical
guidelines
Making
things
worse
Julie
Doolittle
gets
paid
for
every
single
donation
received
by
Doolittle's
PAC
An
analysis
by
TheRestofUs
shows
that
nearly
60
of
the
donations
for
which
Julie
Doolittle
received
a
commission
in
2004-5
came
from
people
or
groups
who
were
already
Doolittle
donors
More
than
half
the
battle
in
fundraising
is
finding
donors
So
Julie
D
got
paid
more
than
120,000
in
that
period
for
doing
half
the
work
Further
undermining
the
notion
that
the
payments
were
fair
market
value
are
the
committee
assignments
Congressman
Doolittle
has
In
2002
he
won
a
seat
on
the
powerful
House
Appropriations
Committee
a
spot
which
guarantees
easy
campaign
money
from
interest
groups
Doolittle
doesn't
need
someone
to
raise
money
it
gets
thrown
at
him
by
all
the
wealthy
interest
groups
in
the
nation's
capital
And
yet
he
pays
his
wife
15
It
just
doesn't
wash
Just
like
Pruitt
Doolittle
is
using
his
public
office
to
line
his
own
pocket
That
the
payments
are
made
to
his
wife
changes
nothing
It
is
ethically
wrong
possibly
illegal
and
should
be
stopped

Nebraska
Pol
Booted
From
Office
for
Campaign
Finance
Violations
The
Nebraska
Supreme
Court
has
convicted
Regent
Dave
Hergert
on
impeachment
charges
related
to
violating
the
state's
campaign
laws
and
lying
to
cover
it
up
as
WOWT
of
Omaha
reports
With
today's
ruling
Hergert
is
immediately
removed
from
office
In
order
to
level
the
playing
field
for
candidates
whose
positions
aren't
backed
by
wealthy
interests
Nebraska
offers
candidates
the
option
of
receiving
some
public
money
for
their
campaigns
if
they
agree
to
a
voluntary
spending
cap
Candidates
whose
opponents
exceed
the
spending
cap
get
public
funds
with
which
to
compete
For
the
system
to
work
candidates
who
opt
to
exceed
the
spending
caps
must
estimate
their
projected
spending
and
inform
the
relevant
state
commission
when
they
reach
a
certain
spending
threshold
so
that
the
commission
may
disburse
funds
to
their
opponent
Hergert
opted
out
of
the
program
choosing
to
exceed
the
overall
spending
limit
of
50,000
for
both
primary
and
general
But
he
underestimated
how
much
he
would
exceed
the
limit
and
failed
to
notify
the
commission
when
he
did
so
which
had
the
effect
of
depriving
his
opponent
of
some
of
the
public
funds
to
which
he
was
entitled
Hergert
spent
much
of
the
under-reported
money
attacking
his
opponent
who
because
he
did
not
receive
the
funds
was
unable
to
respond
effectively
After
the
election
Hergert
reported
spending
twice
his
original
estimate
In
other
words
he
broke
the
law
and
lied
about
it
in
order
to
win
the
election
Recognizing
the
potential
damage
to
the
public
financing
program
that
would
occur
if
Hergert's
actions
went
unpunished
the
Legislature
first
called
on
him
to
resign
and
ultimately
impeached
him
Today's
conviction
by
the
Supreme
Court
was
the
last
step
of
the
process
Nebraska
candidates
who
don't
represent
positions
with
the
backing
of
wealthy
interests
deserve
just
as
much
a
shot
at
public
office
as
those
that
do
Today's
decision
by
the
state
Supreme
Court
helps
maintain
that
opportunity
leaving
democracy
in
Nebraska
a
stronger
institution
tomorrow
than
it
was
yesterday

More
Illegal
Straw
Contributions
in
the
Cunningham
Scandal
As
Lindsay
Nair
reports
in
the
Roanoke
Times
on
last
Thursday
federal
authorities
accused
another
MZM
official
of
funneling
illegal
straw
campaign
contributions
through
MZM
employees
to
Rep
Virgil
Goode
VA
Earlier
this
year
when
former
MZM
CEO
Mitch
Wade
pleaded
guilty
to
bribing
former
congressman
Duke
Cunningham
he
also
pleaded
guilty
to
making
straw
contributions
to
both
Goode
and
Rep
Katherine
Harris
FL
Straw
contributions
are
contributions
to
political
candidates
or
parties
which
have
been
funneled
through
an
intermediate
donor
to
disguise
the
true
source
of
the
funds
often
so
that
the
true
source
may
make
further
contributions
without
running
afoul
of
contribution
limits
The
MZM
official
accused
last
week
Richard
Berglund
is
a
former
district
manager
for
the
company
The
charging
document
accuses
Berglund
of
being
an
illegal
conduit
of
Mitch
Wade's
contributions
to
Goode
and
of
illegally
directing
his
own
money
to
Goode
through
two
different
employees
As
to
that
charging
document
the
account
in
the
Roanoke
Times
and
the
Richmond
Times-Dispatch
seem
to
conflict
with
that
offered
by
the
Washington
Post
as
to
its
exact
nature
The
Times
and
Times-Dispatch
are
describing
it
as
an
indictment
while
the
Post
describes
it
essentially
as
an
information
a
statement
of
facts
about
the
illegal
activities
of
someone
cooperating
with
investigators
If
the
latter
report
is
accurate
Berglund
may
be
implicating
others
involved
in
possible
illegal
campaign
activity
With
Mitch
Wade
pleading
guilty
earlier
this
year
it
seems
likely
that
Berglund's
help
would
entail
naming
others
involved
in
the
scheme
Regardless
last
week's
accusation
against
Mr
Berglund
shows
that
federal
prosecutors
are
still
digging
into
possible
campaign
corruption
by
Duke
Cunningham
and
the
rest
of
the
Gang
That
Couldn't
Cheat
Straight
Three
men
named
as
accomplices
in
the
guilty
pleas
of
Duke
Cunningham
and
Mitch
Wade
have
not
yet
been
indicted
Brent
Wilkes
foremost
among
them
These
men
have
contributed
more
than
1
million
to
various
federal
officials
And
there
is
still
a
pretty
stack
of
public
officials
who
currently
use
the
Members
elevator
in
the
Capitol
who
have
received
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
from
Wilkes
Wade
and
their
employees
some
of
whom
doled
out
millions
in
federal
contracts
to
the
men

Former
Alabama
Governor
Convicted
of
Bribery
and
Corruption
Charges
As
Sallie
Owen
and
Bill
Barrow
report
in
the
Mobile
Register
on
Thursday
a
jury
found
former
Alabama
Governor
Richard
Siegelman
guilty
on
six
counts
of
corruption-related
charges
in
connection
with
500,000
in
campaign
contributions
he
received
from
HealthSouth
CEO
Richard
Scrushy
who
was
also
convicted
In
return
for
the
500k
Siegelman
put
Scrushy
on
the
state
Certificate
of
Need
Review
Board
which
oversees
hospital
expansions
Siegelman
and
Scrushy
still
protest
their
innocence
and
promise
to
appeal
what
Scrushy's
lawyer
calls
the
worst
miscarriage
of
justice
since
General
Sherman
burned
Atlanta
Apparently
he
hasn't
been
watching
the
World
Cup
matches
The
500k
went
to
Siegelman's
campaign
fund
to
support
a
failed
lottery
initiative
As
we've
seen
in
other
states
with
the
initiative
process
politicians
have
figured
out
that
a
great
way
to
advance
themselves
as
candidates
is
to
push
a
ballot
measure
At
the
same
time
bigtime
donors
have
figured
out
that
a
great
way
to
curry
favor
with
politicians
is
to
give
a
ton
of
money
to
their
ballot
initiative
committees
And
when
you
put
the
two
together
you
have
a
perfect
peanut
butter
cup
blend
of
systemic
if
not
personal
corruption
This
is
not
the
first
time
Siegelman
has
stuck
his
thumb
in
the
eye
of
Alabama
democracy
In
1989
when
he
was
the
state
attorney
general
Siegelman
interpreted
Alabama's
limit
on
corporate
contributions
of
500
per
candidate
as
permitting
corporations
to
funnel
unlimited
funds
through
PACs
The
ruling
served
as
spring
rain
for
PACs
in
the
state
which
doubled
in
number
in
the
years
that
followed
allowing
wealthy
corporations
to
multiply
their
campaign
donations
many
times
over
Yesterday's
decision
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
suggests
that
Mr
Siegelman's
cavalier
attitude
towards
the
representation
that
his
fellow
Alabamans
deserve
may
have
finally
caught
up
with
him

Effect
of
Recent
Supreme
Court
Decision
on
CA
Campaign
Reform
Initiative
As
Joan
Biskupic
reports
in
USA
Today
on
Monday
the
U.S
Supreme
Court
issued
a
decision
in
Randall
v
Sorrell
striking
down
Vermont's
law
limiting
political
contributions
and
spending
Three
justices
support
both
spending
and
contribution
limits
three
justices
want
to
get
rid
of
both
and
three
want
to
have
the
latter
but
not
the
former
Given
that
they
can't
agree
among
themselves
what
the
U.S
Constitution
says
you
might
think
they
would
defer
to
the
state
of
Vermont
to
figure
it
out
for
themselves
Nope
While
the
decision
likely
signals
an
end
to
the
modestly
more
expansive
approach
recently
used
by
the
Court
in
reviewing
the
constitutionality
of
campaign
finance
laws
the
Court's
ruling
leaves
intact
the
basic
constitutional
framework
which
has
been
in
place
since
its
seminal
and
near-criminal
1976
decision
Buckley
v
Valeo
The
64
million
remember
when
that
seemed
like
a
lot
question
is
how
will
the
Court's
decision
affect
current
or
prospective
campaign
finance
reforms
Specifically
how
is
the
forthcoming
campaign
reform
ballot
measure
sponsored
by
the
California
Nurses
Association
which
the
California
Secretary
of
State
recently
certified
for
the
November
ballot
affected
The
short
answer
at
least
as
to
the
Nurses
initiative
is
not
much
A
look
back
at
Buckley
is
informative
Buckley
Paradigm
The
Buckley
Court
reviewed
the
federal
reforms
passed
in
the
wake
of
Watergate
The
decision
made
a
fateful
and
oft-ridiculed
distinction
between
limits
on
campaign
spending
and
limits
on
contributions
to
campaigns
The
Court
viewed
spending
limits
as
a
direct
infringement
on
the
free
speech
rights
of
candidates
and
thus
any
attempt
to
limit
spending
must
pass
a
very
strict
scrutiny
Such
review
must
find
that
the
government
has
a
compelling
interest
which
is
met
through
a
law
drawn
as
narrowly
as
possible
In
a
moment
of
colossal
myopia
the
Buckley
Court
found
that
the
only
permissible
compelling
governmental
interests
in
campaign
finance
law
were
to
prevent
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption
This
reading
ignored
the
right
to
a
small-r
republican
form
of
government
representative
democracy
essentially
explicitly
guaranteed
by
the
Constitution
see
our
amicus
brief
in
Randall
In
the
Court's
view
limiting
campaign
spending
did
neither
and
was
thus
unconstitutional
Contribution
limits
on
the
other
hand
did
not
prevent
donors
from
expressing
their
support
for
a
candidate
and
received
a
middle
tier
of
scrutiny
Limiting
political
contributions
directly
reduced
both
corruption
and
the
appearance
of
corruption
according
to
the
Court
and
could
pass
constitutional
muster
if
they
were
not
too
low
The
Court
also
approved
even
encouraged
voluntary
public
financing
programs
Randall
So
spending
limits
no
contribution
limits
yes
public
financing
yes
On
its
face
this
week's
decision
by
the
Supreme
Court
did
nothing
to
change
that
Spending
limits
are
still
no
although
87
of
the
public
thinks
we
need
them
Contribution
limits
are
still
fine
but
must
be
carefully
drafted
Public
financing
ballot
measure
spending
and
independent
expenditure
committees
weren't
discussed
in
the
opinion
But
the
Court's
decision
to
strike
Vermont's
contribution
limits
arguably
signaled
a
shift
from
its
recent
jurisprudence
As
recently
as
2000
in
the
case
Nixon
v
Shrink
the
Court
had
upheld
Missouri's
campaign
finance
law
which
included
contribution
limits
of
1,075
per
election
for
statewide
offices
and
275
per
election
for
state
legislative
races
What
was
different
about
Vermont
Vermont's
contribution
limits
were
200
for
state
representative
300
for
state
senator
and
400
for
statewide
office
Whereas
most
limit
regimes
apply
per
election
which
allows
donors
to
give
the
max
to
a
candidate
once
for
the
primary
election
and
again
for
the
general
election
Vermont's
limits
were
per
election
cycle
giving
donors
only
one
bite
at
the
apple
Vermont's
limits
were
not
indexed
for
inflation
either
meaning
their
effective
value
would
gradually
drop
In
striking
these
limits
the
Court
looked
at
five
factors
1
The
contribution
limits
appear
to
significantly
restrict
the
amount
of
money
available
to
challengers
to
run
competitive
elections
2
The
same
low
limits
are
imposed
on
political
parties
harming
the
right
to
association
3
The
law's
treatment
of
some
volunteer
expenses
as
campaign
expenditures
chills
volunteer
activity
especially
in
concert
with
the
low
contribution
limits
4
The
limits
are
not
adjusted
for
inflation
5
The
record
does
not
show
past
corruption
sufficiently
to
justify
such
stringent
limits
on
constitutional
rights
California
Nurses
Campaign
Reform
Initiative
The
California
Nurses
campaign
reform
initiative
has
two
main
parts
1
a
program
of
voluntary
public
financing
for
qualifying
candidates
for
public
office
and
2
a
very
nearly
comprehensive
series
of
reforms
including
limits
on
contributions
to
candidates
parties
and
independent
expenditure
committees
among
others
aimed
at
creating
a
level
playing
field
for
California
candidates
and
ballot
measures
to
compete
with
those
backed
by
financially
powerful
interests
While
the
Randall
decision
should
have
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
public
financing
program
an
analysis
of
its
effect
on
the
second
part
of
the
initiative
is
a
bit
more
complex
First
off
the
contribution
limits
the
measure
limits
contributions
to
candidates
to
500
per
election
for
legislative
races
and
1,000
per
election
for
statewide
races
contributions
to
parties
are
limited
to
7,500
per
year
These
are
not
only
significantly
higher
than
Vermont's
limits
going
toward
the
first
and
fifth
concerns
listed
above
but
also
address
the
Court's
second
and
fourth
concerns
As
to
the
volunteer
expenses
the
ballot
measure
is
silent
which
should
adequately
address
that
issue
So
if
we
are
to
believe
the
Court's
sincerity
in
laying
out
those
five
factors
the
measure's
contribution
limits
are
constitutionally
sound
These
limits
apply
to
individuals
corporations
and
unions
alike
But
as
most
Californians
could
attest
limits
on
contributions
to
candidates
alone
will
not
take
back
our
electoral
processes
from
the
financially
powerful
interests
in
this
state
As
this
year's
Democratic
gubernatorial
primary
demonstrated
wealthy
interests
will
resort
to
independent
expenditure
committees
to
influence
elections
The
Tsakapouloses
father
Angelo
and
daughter
Eleni
spent
nearly
8
million
on
behalf
of
their
business
partner
Phil
Angelides
Other
IE
committees
spent
millions
in
the
June
2006
primary
in
support
and
opposition
to
candidates
And
the
ballot
initiative
process
created
as
the
people's
answer
to
a
legislature
dominated
by
special
interests
has
also
been
made
captive
by
the
state's
financially
powerful
The
pharmaceutical
industry
alone
spent
80
million
on
two
initiatives
last
year
Tobacco
companies
energy
companies
gaming
tribes
and
developers
have
all
spent
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
in
recent
years
on
initiatives
Even
labor
unions
have
gotten
into
the
act
spending
over
120
million
in
2005
opposing
Governor
Schwarzenegger's
special
election
initiatives
Tha
ballot
process
has
been
further
corrupted
by
the
new
technique
pioneered
by
Cruz
Bustamante
and
perfected
by
Arnold
Schwarzenegger
in
which
candidates
for
public
office
use
ballot
measure
committees
to
evade
the
state's
contribution
limits
Bustamante
Schwarzenegger
and
Phil
Angelides
have
all
used
these
committees
which
are
currently
not
subject
to
any
limits
on
the
size
of
contributions
they
can
receive
to
advance
themselves
as
candidates
The
Nurses
initiative
takes
on
all
these
issues
addressing
them
to
the
fullest
extent
allowed
by
constitutional
doctrine
The
effect
of
the
Randall
decision
on
any
of
these
reforms
is
unclear
perhaps
especially
so
because
the
Randall
Court
addressed
none
of
these
issues
directly
But
a
look
at
where
things
stood
constitutionally
prior
to
Randall
suggests
that
the
Nurses
initiative
while
important
cutting
edge
policy
remains
on
sound
footing

Independent
Expenditure
Committees
IE
committees
are
currently
allowed
to
raise
and
spend
money
without
limit
to
influence
candidate
elections
in
California
As
state
GOP
chairman
Duf
Sundheim
recently
pointed
out
in
a
discussion
we
had
on
the
radio
program
Insight
these
committees
currently
are
a
huge
loophole
in
California's
scheme
of
contribution
limits
Mr
Sundheim
recommended
a
constitutional
amendment
to
allow
for
mandatory
limits
on
how
much
anyone
can
spend
on
an
election
including
candidates
and
independent
actors
That's
a
good
idea
But
the
Nurses
initiative
does
take
some
good
measures
to
address
the
problem
The
Supreme
Court
has
upheld
a
ban
on
corporate
contributions
to
IEs
in
the
case
Austin
v
Michigan
Chamber
of
Commerce
More
recently
and
perhaps
more
importantly
the
Supreme
Court
upheld
the
2002
Bipartisan
Campaign
Reform
Act's
ban
on
soft
money
to
political
parties
in
the
case
McConnell
v
FEC
In
McConnell
the
Court
found
that
limiting
contributions
to
parties
was
a
necessary
and
constitutional
way
to
prevent
evasion
of
BCRA's
contribution
limits
As
IE
committees
have
been
used
to
evade
contribution
limits
in
California
limiting
contributions
to
such
committees
is
a
constitutional
way
of
preventing
such
evasion
The
Nurses
initiative
does
just
that
limiting
contributions
to
IE
committees
to
7,500
per
year
as
part
of
its
overall
limit
on
aggregate
contributions
by
a
person
or
entity
to
15,000
per
year

Candidate-controlled
Ballot
Committees
Lt
Gov
Cruz
Bustamante
was
fined
260,000
by
the
Fair
Political
Practices
Commission
for
using
a
ballot
committee
to
evade
contribution
limits
In
just
three
short
years
Gov
Arnold
Schwarzenegger
has
raised
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
into
his
ballot
committees
much
of
it
spent
to
raise
his
profile
as
a
candidate
State
Treasurer
and
current
gubernatorial
candidate
Phil
Angelides
used
his
ballot
committee
to
send
out
flyers
touting
his
support
for
pre-school
in
the
days
before
the
June
primary
Assembly
Speaker
Fabian
Nez
is
raising
25,000
a
piece
into
his
ballot
committee
from
corporations
with
financial
interests
in
legislation
before
the
Assembly
You
would
be
hard
pressed
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
influence
gained
with
a
50,000
contribution
to
a
candidate's
campaign
committee
as
opposed
to
a
candidate's
ballot
committee
Clearly
politicians
from
both
parties
are
eviscerating
California's
contribution
limits
with
their
ballot
committees
The
FPPC
recognized
this
when
they
passed
a
regulation
applying
the
contribution
limits
on
candidate
committees
to
ballot
committees
controlled
by
candidates
The
Nurses
initiative
limits
contributions
to
candidate-controlled
ballot
measures
to
10,000
per
person
While
the
original
FPPC
regulation
was
struck
as
unauthorized
in
the
Political
Reform
Act
by
a
Sacramento
County
Superior
Court
judge
in
a
lawsuit
by
Governor
Schwarzenegger
and
his
business
ally
funders
McConnell
would
seem
to
allow
for
this
type
of
regulation
if
it
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
evasion
of
contribution
limits

Ballot
Measure
Spending
California's
love-hate
relationship
with
the
ballot
initiative
process
has
been
a
lot
more
hate
than
love
lately
As
wealthy
interests
have
turned
the
process
into
a
playground
for
the
rich
voters
have
turned
increasingly
hostile
towards
any
ballot
measure
even
those
whose
general
intent
is
backed
by
a
majority
of
Californians
While
corporate
interests
have
played
the
predominant
role
in
the
corruption
of
this
process
labor
unions
and
wealthy
individuals
have
done
their
fair
share
as
well
The
Buckley
paradigm
has
traditionally
been
interpreted
to
prohibit
any
attempt
to
check
the
influence
of
big
money
on
the
initiative
process
there
are
no
candidates
to
corrupt
after
all
But
the
ban
on
corporate
contributions
to
IE
committees
in
Austin
also
didn't
involve
candidates
In
the
Austin
case
the
Court
ruled
that
the
very
nature
of
corporations
that
they
are
designed
and
given
public
tax
breaks
in
order
to
generate
profits
created
such
a
risk
of
overwhelming
the
political
process
that
corporate
political
spending
could
be
seen
as
inherently
corrupting
and
could
thus
be
limited
or
even
prohibited
even
when
no
candidates
are
involved
The
same
rationale
applies
to
corporate
spending
in
California's
ballot
initiative
process
Pharmaceutical
tobacco
energy
financial
services
and
development
corporations
have
used
the
massive
profits
generated
by
their
corporate
form
to
completely
overwhelm
the
California
initiative
process
While
labor
unions
have
done
so
on
a
smaller
level
there
is
less
of
an
argument
to
be
made
if
any
under
current
constitutional
doctrine
that
the
spending
by
those
groups
can
be
limited
because
these
groups
are
formed
in
part
for
political
purposes
The
Nurses
initiative
is
written
accordingly
Corporations
are
limited
to
spending
10,000
a
year
from
the
corporate
treasury
on
ballot
measures
Both
for-profit
and
non-profit
corporations
are
free
to
create
a
PAC
which
can
spend
unlimited
sums
on
ballot
measures
Spending
by
labor
unions
and
wealthy
individuals
on
ballot
measures
isn't
limited
because
there
is
no
readily
apparent
constitutional
basis
for
doing
so
So
what
is
the
upshot
of
Randall
on
these
provisions
While
respecting
the
Buckley
paradigm
the
Nurses
initiative
is
ground-breaking
in
a
couple
of
areas
In
so
doing
the
measure
makes
some
reasonable
assumptions
based
on
the
factual
record
of
big
money
in
California
politics
over
the
last
30
years
which
has
never
been
squarely
considered
by
a
court
and
on
current
constitutional
doctrine
Most
experts
will
say
that
the
Randall
decision
signals
that
the
current
Court
is
less
open
to
campaign
finance
regulation
Opponents
of
the
Nurses
campaign
reform
measure
will
likely
cherry-pick
Randall's
language
to
argue
that
the
whole
thing
is
folly
that
the
Court
won't
uphold
any
of
it
But
that
does
not
mean
that
any
of
the
Nurses
initiative
will
be
stricken
and
even
if
any
provisions
are
stricken
it
isn't
fatal
to
the
whole
measure
the
measure
contains
a
well-written
severability
clause
California
has
seen
big
money
pour
into
its
elections
on
a
level
unmatched
even
at
the
national
level
at
the
time
of
the
Buckley
decision
This
can
only
help
Likewise
constitutionally
the
Court
recognized
only
three
years
ago
not
only
that
contribution
limits
are
constitutional
but
that
loophole-closing
techniques
to
prevent
their
evasion
are
also
constitutional
The
facts
are
behind
the
measure
The
law
is
behind
the
measure
Standing
between
the
measure
and
its
enactment
will
be
a
whole
host
of
special
interests
all
of
whom
have
two
things
in
common
a
desire
to
maintain
their
stranglehold
over
California
policy
and
politics
and
the
ability
to
spend
millions
to
do
so
