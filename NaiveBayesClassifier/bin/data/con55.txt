Fox
news
is
running
a
story
about
an
uncensored
documentary
regarding
Hillary
Clinton's
fundraising
practices
This
video
is
just
a
small
picture
of
what
a

President
Hillary
Clinton
would
do
You

the
video
here

and

There
is

in

that

are

of

that

I've
got
a
few
pictures
to
share
but
before
I
do
I
should
probably
provide
a
little
background
information
on
what
it
is
you'll
be
viewing
The
location
of
the
satellite
imagery
is
Huntersville
Ohio
along
State
Route
309
Huntersville
is
an
unincorporated
area
located
in
rural
Hardin
county
about
20
miles
east
of
Lima
All
three
images
were
screen
captured
from
Weather.com
and
the
imagery
is
courtesy
of
Microsoft
Virtual
Earth
The
three
pictures
are
of
the
same
geographic
location
the
only
difference
being
the
zoom
level
Now
take
a
close
look
around
the
triangular
shaped
wooded
area
So
did
you
see
anything
unusual
I
was
directed
to
weather.com
today
to
view
the
image
and
as
soon
as
I
got
zoomed
in
far
enough
a
face
popped
out
I
was
instructed
to
look
for
the
face
of
an
Indian
native
American
not
to
be
confused
with
the
Indian
who
takes
your
call
to
Dell's
tech
support
had
I
not
been
I
would
have
probably
still
seen
the
face
but
may
not
have
labeled
it
as
looking
Indian
Then
again
I
may
have
I'll
never
know
but
I
do
know
my
perception
was
somewhat
tainted
in
that
respect
If
the
imagery
in
and
of
itself
doesn't
perk
your
interest
there
is
one
final
item
worth
mentioning
Located
off
the
top
left
of
the
triangular
shaped
wooded
area
is
an
Indian
burial
ground
I'm
not
suggesting
anything
what-so-ever
The
different
shades
of
the
soil
can
be
explained
by
moisture
content
and
the
image
by
the
fact
that
we
see
faces
everywhere
simply
because
we're
so
used
to
seeing
them
The
latter
would
be
why
we
find
faces
in
clouds
tree
bark
the
sides
of
buildings
the
occasional
chocolate
chip
cookie
and
via
technology
satellite
imagery
I
think
it's
just
the
way
our
mind
has
been
conditioned
to
process
what
is
into
what
is
perceived
Having
said
that
and
fully
believing
the
explanation
doesn't
make
it
any
less
freaky

Follow-up
to
Candidate
Forum
I
promised
a
follow
up
on
the
debate
between
the
city
council
president
candidates
As
most
of
you
know
I
am
also
in
the
midst
of
my
own
campaign
It
has
been
a
very
busy
couple
of
weeks
Anyhow
The
candidate
forum
held
October
10th
at
the
Civic
Center
did
not
provide
voters
with
any
significant
new
information
about
either
candidate
Most
of
the
questions
focused
on
economic
development
budget
and
finance
issues
and
others
Of
significance
a
question
from
WLIO
news
anchor
Jeff
Fitzgerald
regarding
the
recent
issue
of
secret
meetings
The
question
was
posed
to
both
candidates
about
how
they
would
prevent
such
violations
from
occurring
again
Of
course
Mr
Magnus
responded
by
stating
that
no
violation
occurred
He
also
stated
that
the
way
the
legislation
was
handled
pulled
from
the
Safety
Services
committee
by
yours
truly
was
of
more
concern
to
him
It
doesn't
surprise
me
that
he
could
not
answer
the
question
without
taking
an
indirect
swipe
at
me
Overall
due
to
time
constraints
and
the
desire
to
keep
the
forum
positive
nothing
significant
was
revealed
There
are
more
debates
to
follow
On
a
separate
note
the
Lima
news
has
published
on
their
website
profiles
of
each
of
the
candidates
as
well
as
responses
to
questions
we
were
asked

races
can
be

here
There
will
also

Violation

Sunshine

Its
not

have
a

official
admit
to
holding
discussions
and
making
decisions
about
official
city
business
without
doing
so
in

public

This
would
constitute
a
potential

of

Stirring
the
Pot
As
a
member
of
Lima
City
Council
I
have
a
duty
to
represent
the
people
of
the
2nd
Ward
I
am
also
responsible
for
bringing
concerns
of
citizens
to
council
or
other
government
committees
when
appropriate
In
May
the
issue
of
marijuana
possession
laws
and
potential
deficiencies
in
our
current
city
ordinances
was
brought
to
me
by
a
resident
of
the
2nd
ward
I
referred
his
concerns
along
with
literature
citing
changes
Cincinnati
made
to
strengthen
their
ordinances
to
councils
Safety
Services
committee
After
four
months
of
inaction
I
moved
to
remove
the
referral
from
the
safety
services
committee
to
my
own
committee
to
insure
a
hearing
The
voice
vote
was
in
favor
of
this
motion
What
happened
next
as
recounted
by
the
Lima
News
was
absolutely
shocking
to
everyone
in
attendance
Unfortunately
I
believe
this
is
only
a
snapshot
of
what
may
lie
ahead
for
Lima
City
Council
pending
the
outcome
of
the
November
election
I
made
a
commitment
to
stand
on
my
conservative
beliefs
and
my
desire
to
work
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
Lima
for
the
people
and
the
city
of
Lima
not
for
self
gain

such
as
what

The

of

Today
came
word
from
Washington
that

Paul
Gillmor
was
found
dead
in

Many
Republicans
will
admit
that
even
while
President
of

Ohio
Senate
traditionally
a
moderate
republican
Rep
Gillmor
was
a
staunch
conservative
who
was
well
liked
on

sides
of

aisle
His

in
both
Ohio
and

Various
Musings
I
have
been
a
real
slacker
since
vacation
a
week
ago
I
keep
thinking
about
posting
issues
here
but
have
not
had
time
to
post
what
I
really
wanted
The
result
is
a
variety
of
small
issues
that
have
developed
over
the
last
three
weeks
First
Lima
City
Council
voted
down
an
ordinance
that
would
have
placed
the
Inter
Governmental
Agreement
between
the
Shawnee
Indians
and
the
City
of
Lima
on
the
November
ballot
At
stake
is
a
destination
resort
casino
The
halt
in
progress
on
the
IGA
is
the
result
of
advice
from
legal
council
obtained
by
the
city
Several
issues
were
pointed
out
as
potential
concerns
with
the
current
draft
of
the
IGA
While
I
am
disappointed
that
the
issue
is
in
a
holding
pattern
I
certainly
agree
that
this
IGA
must
be
a
rock
solid
agreement
We
have
made
great
progress
in
the
IGA
but
issues
of
sovereignty
liability
protections
for
casino
employees
and
patrons
use
of
tribe
payments
to
the
city
the
length
of
the
agreement
and
defining
what
gaming
revenues
are
I
will
continue
to
support
placing
the
IGA
on
the
ballot
for
the
residents
of
the
City
of
Lima
to
approve
or
deny
if
and
when
an
agreement
comes
to
fruition
Second
I
Like
fourth
ward
city
councilman
Tom
Tebben
am
tired
of
being
told
that
I
am
going
to
hell
for
my
stance
on
the
Casino
issue
I
personally
would
like
to
see
the
development
occur
Some
20
Billion
leaves
Ohio
every
year
to
neighboring
states
who
have
casino's
The
economics
make
sense
I
will
ALWAYS
support
a
vote
of
the
people
on
this
issue
At
least
that
way
everyone
who
votes
yes
will
be
there
with
me
Third
As
everyone
has
seen
by
now
most
of
northwest
Ohio
has
been
ravaged
by
flooding
My
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
those
affected
Findlay
Bluffton
and
Ottawa
have
been
especially
hit
Here
in
Lima
there
were
multiple
streets
with
high
water
that
were
closed
Fortunately
the
worst
damage
in
Lima
was
an
intersection
on
North
Shore
Dr
and
Collett
Water
pressure
built
up
in
the
storm
sewer
caused
the
84-inch
pipe
30
feet
deep
in
the
ground
to
blow
sending
its
manhole
cover
at
least
12
feet
in
the
air
reaching
the
traffic
lights
I
have
seen
some
truly
amazing
pictures
of
the
flooding
and
encourage
anyone
to
check
out
foxnews.com
or
the
limanews.com
to
get
an
idea
of
the
damage
Finally
for
those
sports
fans
out
there
another
football
season
is
upon
us
It
is
going
to
be
a
rather
predictable
season
for
my
teams
At
the
high
school
level
Elida
is
going
to
continue
its
losing
ways
as
evidenced
by
last
night's
51-0
drubbing
game
was
called
at
half
time
due
to
lightning
Ohio
State
is
a
huge
underdog
in
the
Big
Ten
but
will
certainly
surprise
many
if
we
can
watch
the
games…come
on
Big
Ten
Network
and
Time
Warner
get
these
games
on
TV
The
Cleveland
Browns
will
continue
with
their
9th
year
of
rebuilding
since
coming
back
into
the
NFL…at
least
they
are
not
part
of
the
Cincinnati
Bengals
penal
league
I
realize
the
previous
comment
might
get
me

Precious
Poets
Remember
Our
Troops
Back
a
Play
There
was
a
young
gentleman
who
read
Beyond
Glory
Medal
of
Honor
Heroes
in
Their
Own
Words
by
Larry
Smith
After
reading
this
book
he
felt
compelled
to
write
a
play
about
these
men
and
tell
their
stories
in
words
It
opened
in
2004
on
the
edge
of
Arlington
Cemetery
at
a
small
theater
inside
the
Women
in
Military
Service
Memorial
Eight
of
these
men
were
chosen
of
the
twenty-four
available
to
represent
the
men
to
be
honored
There
was
an
apolitical
play
meaning
this

Mr
Peede
had
been
asked
to
direct
a
new
NEA
National
Endowment
for
the
Arts
program
called
Operation
Homecoming
Writing
the
Wartime
Experience
Its
intention
was
to
help
soldiers
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
or
their
families
to
put
their
experiences
into
writing--fiction
non-fiction
and
poetry
The
idea
was
suggested
to
NEA
Chairman
Dana
Gioia
a
poet
by
Connecticut
poet
Marilyn
Nelson
who'd
recently
served
as
a
visiting
writer
at
West
Point
Good
for
the
poets
Reluctant
to
wait
years
for
Congressional
funding
or
to
divert
money
from
other
NEA
programs
Chairman
Gioia
sought
private
funding
for
Operation
Homecoming
Quietly
the
Boeing
Company
stepped
up
ultimately
giving
1.2
million
The
soldiers
tutors
at
NEA's
workshops
included
writers
such
as
Barry
Hannah
Tobias
Wolff
Mark
Bowden
Victor
Davis
Hanson
and
Tom
Clancy
The
result
is
a
book
Operation

which--again
some
understatement--is
breathtakingly
good

Bill
Roggio
is
an
excellent
writer
who
decided
he
was
not
going
to
write
about
those
things
which
he
did
not
have
first

he
suited
up

in

do
this

I

you
should
know
that
when

removed
them

they
would
need
a

a

THAT
is
why
they
are
in

To
join
in
the

for
our
very

Why
do
I
say
our

The
Taliban
and
al
Qaida
are
interchangeable
names
they
call

another
This
is
to
give
some
of

cover
Do
not

Now
that
that's

If

they

Lima
Reaches
Agreement
with

for
Casino

The
City
of
Lima
reached
an
Inter-governmental
Agreement
with
the
Shawnee
Indian
Tribe
on
Monday
the
first
step
necessary
for
the
establishment
of
a
resort

casino
in
Lima
The
IGA
sets
up
provisions
for
such
things
as
safety
services
and
income
tax
revenue
as
well
as
profit
sharing
for
the
city
The
plan
contains
three
phases
ranging
from
the
construction
of
a
casino
to
hotels
and
shopping
to
entertainment
venues
It
is
estimated
that
the
casino
would
generate
100
to
300
Million
in
revenue
each
year
The
city's
share
would
be
2
or
2
to
4
million
per
year
City
Council
referred
the
IGA
to
council
as
a
whole
to
review
If
approved
the
IGA
would
be
placed
on
the
ballot
in

for

Uyghur's
women
and
girls
taken
as
slaves
This
is
an
article
that
really
bothers
me
Anything
to
do
with
slavery
bothers
me
to
the
point
no
one
has
ever
seen
from
me
It
does
not
matter
the
color
the
location
the
race
the
religion
or
whatever
else
there
is
IT
IS
WRONG
I
believe
it
is
also
a
SIN
against
God
Yes
it
is
in
the
Bible
So
is
adultry
Why
some
may
ask
I
can
answer
this
To
show
us
the
damages
that
sins
cause
and
to
teach
us
how
to
live
and
be
better
people
than
that
God
did
not
create
slavery
man
did
If
you
want
to
blame
it
on
someone
look
into
your
own
heart
first
Always
no
matter
the
situation
That
is
a
good
rule
Back
to
the
article
In
the
area
of
Uyghur
a
minority
Muslim
part
of
northwest
China
it
is
very
poor
So
when
the
local
officials
came
around
telling
the
families
about
a
training
program
to
work
in
factories
for
the
women
and
girls
for
which
they
would
be
paid
500
yuan
per
month
in
the
beginning
and
later
they
would
be
paid
up
to
900
yuan
It
comes
as
no
surprise
to
me
but
they
have
received
no
pay
There
are
213
girls
that
we
know
of
who
signed
up
for
this
program
If
you
would
like
to
read
the
actual
article
it
is
Radio
Free
Asia
Please
read
it
because
there
is
more
The
parents
and
the
girls
who
manage
to
escape
and
return
home
are
being
punished
and
made
to
go
back
without
pay
It
is
a
crime
against
humanity
Where
are
the
Human
Rights
groups
Do
you
think
we
should

something

Do

I've

reading
the

around

something
small
stuck
out
that
I
haven't
seen
anywhere
else
Hotair
has
a

of
a
gung
ho
gun
owner
in
Michigan
and
Joe

telling
him
he
needs
help
Then
I
read
this
story
linked
from
Drudge
A
Clio
Mich
man
named
Jered
asked
about
gun
control
while
brandishing
an
automatic
weapon
Unless
I'm
missing
something
the
truth
is
that
for
all
they
know
that
gun
could
have
been
made
from
cardboard
and
balsa
wood
held
together
by
Elmer's
and
painted
black
to
give
it
that
come
to
Jesus
look
Perhaps
it
was
a
fully
functioning...modified.....BB
gun
I'd
question
the
time
put
into
each
of
these
endeavors
but
who
am
I
to
judge
how
the
average
Joe
gets
his
15
minutes
To
cut
to
the
chase
is
it
just
me
or
did
Biden
just
give
more
ammo
along
with
the
writer
of
the
above
linked
story
to
those
which
claim
that
the
anti
gun
agenda
is
more

the
answer
to
my
question
This
clip
is
7:59

the
title
of
it
is
Operation

They
were
successful
in
this
mission
killing
29

capturing
23
of

They
also
rescued
8
hostages
who
were
about
to
be
executed
on
the
day
of
the
mission

Great

guys
These
next
two
clips
sort
of
go
together
if
not
by
nature
then
by

This
one
is
32
seconds
long
and
the
title
is
Crispy

It
is
almost
like
watching
a
silent
movie
except
it
is
real

as
I

to
put
it
The
next
clip
is
titled
Crispy
Terrorists
on
the
July
15th

and
lasts
for
58
seconds
And
to
say
that
the
last
one
is
the
least
one
would
be
an
incredibly
wrong
assumption
This
young

sends
it

Quote
of
the
Day
Shamelessly
stolen
from
BizzyBlog
Dr
Alveda
King
the
niece
of
Dr
Martin
Luther
King
Jr
said
that
the
allegations
of
animal
cruelty
announced
in
the
case
against
star
quarterback
Michael
Vick
highlight
the
disparity
in
societal
protections
for
animals
and
unborn
humans
The
appalling
cruelty
to
dogs
described
in
the
complaint
against
Michael
Vick
immediately
reminds
me
of
another
kind
of
cruelty
that
is
not
only
not
punished
but
is
protected
by
our
authorities
said
Dr
King
I'm
talking
about
the
incredible
cruelty
suffered
by
babies
who
are
stabbed
have
limb
torn
from
limb
or
have
their
skulls
crushed
in
the
womb
by
abortionists
The
pain
these
children
endure
is
undoubtedly
excruciating
yet
we
close
our
eyes
and
look
the
other
way
in
the
name
of
choice
She
concluded
Yes
of
course
we
should
ensure
humane
treatment
of
animals
said
Dr
King
but
shouldn't
we
also
humanely
treat
humans

soft
revolution
against
the
brutal
clerical
regime
Kian
Tajbakhsh
has
been
charged
with
seeking
the
overthrow
of
the
Iranian
government
He
and
Esfandiari
are
being
held
in
Tehran's
notorious
Evin
Prison
which
contains
many
other
Iranian
political
prisoners
and
dissidents
Ali
Shakeri
and
Parnaz
Azima
may
be
joining
them
soon
due
to
trumpt-up
charges
Panaz
has
been
charged
because
she
works
for
RFE
of
an
institution
that
spreads
propaganda
against
the
Islamic
Republic
And
the
Europeans
still
want
to
have
more
talks
At
least
Radio
Free
Europe
did
not
sit
on
their
hands
They
used
some
very
strong
words
toward
the
Iranian
regime
How
about
you
Mr
President
The
Iranians
are
hoping
to
use
this
former
FBI
Agent
as
a
pawn
to
gain
leverage
in
the
release
of
the
bastards
we
caught.While
some
may
think
this
is
related
to
Bush
in
some
way
let
me
make
this
clear
These
arrests
started
in
December
of
last
year
and
they
got
worse
when
the
Iranian
regime
started
cracking
down
on
any
dissent
Not
every
damn
thing
is
George
Bush
fault
Remember
All
of
these
people
had
passports
which
were
confiscated
and
most
of
them
have
dual-citizenship

The
Return
of
the
Do
Nothing
Congress
From
ABC
News
in
early
May
Members
of
Congress
know
the
Washington-area
airports
very
well
Most
members
use
them
twice
a
week
arriving
for
work
late
Tuesday
and
scurrying
back
to
their
home
states
on
Thursday
Congress
is
on
schedule
to
meet
fewer
days
this
year
than
any
Congress
since
1948
the
year
President
Truman
campaigned
against
what
he
called
the
do-nothing
Congress
They
call
it
the
Tuesday
to
Thursday
Club
said
Rep
Jim
Cooper
D-Tenn
That
means
you
get
here
Tuesday
night
you
have
a
few
easy
votes
you
vote
on
Wednesday
and
then
you
go
back
home
Thursday
afternoon
And
that
believe
it
or
not
is
considered
a
work
week
in
Washington
I
worked
with
a
guy
once
that
seemed
to
never
work
a
full
week
When
he
was
there
he
would
arrive
late
take
a
long
lunch
and
usually
skip
out
early
Every
now
and
then
he'd
put
in
a
late
night
or
be
called
in
during
the
evening
and
stay
until
morning
When
this
happened
the
rest
of
us
got
to
hear
from
him
about
how
hard
he's
been
working
and
that
he
was
there
all
night
Never
mind
the
fact
that
all
of
us
was
working
many
more
hours
he
was
there
all
night
and
was
the
only
one
working
hard
in
his
mind
It
became
a
running
joke
around
the
office
so
and
so
worked
so
hard
you
know
he
worked
all
night
I'm
reminded
of
that
because
of
this
Frustrated
by
Republican
efforts
to
block
votes
on
bringing
American
combat
troops
home
from
Iraq
Senate
Democratic
leaders
were
preparing
to
roll
out
sleeping
cots
Tuesday
for
an
all-night
debate
on
the
war.Unlike
my
old
coworker
they've
apparently
got
cots
but
just
like
him
the
entire
event
is
more
an
exercise
in
show
rather
than
substance
But
that's
congress
you
know
they'll
work
all
night
if
need
be

this
Coming
Tariq
Al-Daour
imprisoned
in
Britain
as
a
co-conspirator
for
a
jihadi
website
was
given
a
computer
and
an
ISP
while
serving
time
inside

Probably
on

non-the-less
What
did
Tariq
do
with
his
new
found
freedom
Take
a
guess
AN
al-Qaeda
fanatic
jailed
for
inciting
murder
online
was
caught
making
a
website
urging
terror
attacks
from
his
cell
in
Britain's
most
secure
prison
The
laptop
was
seized
after
a
violent
struggle
when
prison
officers
suspected
he
was
misusing
it
and
the
hate-filled
website
called
Global
Jihad
was
found
They
fear
Al-Daour
may
have
used
it
to
contact
other
al-Qaeda
terrorists
and
are
scrutinising
calls
he
made
Al-Daour's
website
built
while
he
was
on
trial
was
full
of
al-Qaeda
propaganda
calling
on
extremists
to
wage
war
on
the
West
In
other
news
Britain
is
now
requiring
that
all
convicted
pedophiles
do

service
at

OK
I
made
that
last
bit
up

not

One
Event
Two
Takes
The
first
paragraph
of
any
news
story
is
perhaps
the
most
important
element
next
to
the
title
This
is
because
that's
as
far
as
many
of
us
get
that's
if
we
even
make
it
past
the
title
before
moving
onto
the
next
story
Having
said
that
I
stumbled
upon
two
different
articles
today
about
the
same
event
progress
or
lack
thereof
in
Iraq
The
first
from
the
AP
via
the
Detroit
Free
Press
The
Iraqi
government
has
not
yet
met
any
of
18
goals
for
political
military
and
economic
reform
the
Bush
administration
said
Thursday
in
an
interim
report
certain
to
inflame
debate
in
Congress
over
growing
calls
for
a
U.S
troop
withdrawal
The
second
is
from
CNN
A
report
on
U.S.-set
benchmarks
for
Iraq
shows
satisfactory
progress
in
eight
areas
while
highlighting
that
there's
more
work
to
do
in
other
areas
President
Bush
said
Thursday.One
sets
an
optimistic
tone
the
other
makes
me
want
to
jam
a
pencil
in
my
jugular
It's
not
so
much
that
it's
negative
it's
that
AP
writers
Lolita
C
Baldor
and
Anne

themselves

When
a
conservative
appears
on
talk
radio
liberals
cry
for
the
Fairness
Doctrine
Seventy-five
free
hours
for
Archbishop
Gore's
Church
of
Climate
Change
Not
a
peep.Excerpt
from
an
editorial
about
NBC
airing
a
combined
75
hours
of
Al
Gore's
Live
Earth
infomercial
It's
being
reported
that
there
may
have
been
a
cat
fight
behind
closed
doors
between
Senators
McCain
and
Voinovich
During
said
spat
Voinovich
reportedly
pointed
out
that
AQ
would
not
be
in
Iraq
if
it
were
not
for
U.S
Troops
being
there
I
kinda
sorta
thought
that
was
part
of
the
plan
killing
them
over
there
You
know
instead
of
in
Times
Square
At
this
stage
of
the
post
I'd
like
to
apologize
to
my
fellow
conservatives
as
I
voted
for
Voinovich
at
least
twice
In
separate
elections
mind
you
It
will
not
happen
again
My
7
months
pregnant
wife
drug
home
a
couple
sick
kittens
I
was
not
impressed
We
drug
another
kitten
down
to
Cincy
from
Lima
for
a
co-worker
of
hers
to
adopt
Said
co-worker
called
my
wife
4
hours
after
assuming
possession
of
said
kitten
stating
she
could
not
make
that
kind
of
commitment
so
now
we've
got
three
Well
four
if
you
include
my
7
year
old
cat
and
an
explanation
as
to
why
she's
not
yet
married
I'm
being
assured
that
the
returned
adoption
will
be
given
away
but
I'm
still
not
at
ease
with
the
situation
toxoplasmosis
aside
I
might
post
some
