Political
malpractice

Category
Campaign
2008
This
is
flat-out
weird
Barack
Obama
praises
the
McCain-Leiberman
cap-and-trade
bill
McCain
runs
it
as
a
campaign
spot
The
thrust
of
the
McCain
campaign
especially
for
the
past
month
has
been
that
Barack
Obama
is
evil
and
scary
a
metrosexual
cosmopolitan
celebrity
who
wants
to
molest
your
children
while
his
terrorist
friends
plot
to
kill
you
and
his
homeboy
welfare
chiselers
from
ACORN
steal
elections
so
they
can
then
steal
your
money
Now
four
days
before
the
election
McCain
shows
the
voters
Obama
reaching
across
the
aisle
to
praise
his
rival
in
his
best
calm
reasonable
thoughtful
tone
What
am
I
missing
here
Is
Steve
Schmidt
in
the
tank

John
McCain
Cool
and
consistent
by
Jonathan
Zasloff
Category
Campaign
2008
John
McCain
The
consensus
seems
now
to
have
settled
down
that
John
McCain's
campaign
behavior
has
been
erratic
and
temperamental
Certainly
that
was
the
Obama
campaign's
narrative
In
fact
McCain
has
been
about
as
consistent
as
can
be
whatever
Steve
Schmidt
tells
him
to
do
he
does
Since
Schmidt
is
obsessed
about
the
news
cycle
and
has
determined
that
McCain
can
win
only
by
a
scorched-earth
Rovian
racially-tinged
campaign
that's
what
McCain
does
All
of
the
things
that
observers
have
seen
as
erratic
have
in
fact
been
Schmidt's
ideas
and
carried
through
The
Palin
nomination
Check
Suspending
the
campaign
Check
Declaring
victory
3
days
after
this
suspension
Check
Socialist-Marxist
Check
Obama
is
too
brown
for
America
Check
This
only
looks
erratic
because
Schmidt's
focus
on
the
news
cycle
and
attack
mentality
needs
a
new
story
every
day
Every
day
after
all
Obama
will
say
something
Thus
every
day
Schmidt
will
find
a
way
to
lie
about
it
Most
importantly
you
can't
win
a
news
cycle
every
day
without
coming
up
with
a
new
spin
on
the
basic
story
because
reporters
will
get
bored
with
it
Rove
did
the
same
thing
one
day
Kerry
was
a
flip-flopper
the
next
day
he
was
French
the
next
day
he
was
an
elitist
windsurfer
Theme
and
variations
The
difference
is
that
this
year
the
fundamentals
are
so
bad
and
Obama
is
so
talented
and
well-financed
that
it
doesn't
work
So
McCain
has
actually
been
incredibly
disciplined
Give
the
old
guy
some
credit
UPDATE
Similarly
Francis
Fukuyama
underestimates
him
h/t
Sullivan
McCain?s
appeal
was
always
that
he
could
think
for
himself
but
as
the
campaign
has
progressed
he
has
seemed
simply
erratic
and
hotheaded
His
choice
of
Sarah
Palin
as
a
running
mate
was
highly
irresponsible
we
have
suffered
under
the
current
president
who
entered
office
without
much
knowledge
of
the
world
and
was
easily
captured
by
the
wrong
advisers
McCain?s
lurching
from
Reaganite
free-marketer
to
populist
tribune
makes
one
wonder
whether
he
has
any
underlying
principles
at
all
This
is
unfair
McCain
has
one
underlying
principle
he
wants
to
win
Nothing
else
matters
In
order
to
do
that
he
will
listen
to
Schmidt
Pretty
straightforward
in
my
view

Laying
off
the
Obama
voters
by
Mark
Kleiman
Category
Watching
Conservatives
The
two
main
themes
of
the
McCain
campaign
fear
and
hatred
are
combined
in
the
latest
bit
of
viral
nonsense
circulating
albeit
with
slightly
different
numbers
both
by
email
and
on
line
The
usual
wingnut
sites
are
posting
it
and
celebrating
it
though
it
has
urban
legend
written
all
over
it
Obviously
the
idea
of
putting
political
opponents
on
the
unemployment
line
fills
their
frigid
little
hearts
with
joy
Dear
Fellow
Business
Owners
As
a
Business
owner
who
employs
30
people
I
have
resigned
myself
to
the
fact
that
Barack
Obama
will
be
our
next
President
and
that
my
Taxes
and
Fees
will
go
up
in
a
BIG
way
To
compensate
for
these
increases
I
figure
that
the
Customer
will
have
to
see
an
increase
in
my
fees
to
them
of
about
8
I
will
also
have
to
lay
off
6
of
my
employees
This
really
bothered
me
as
I
believe
we
are
family,here
and
didn't
know
how
to
choose
who
will
have
to
go
So
this
is
what
I
did
I
strolled
through
the
parking
lot
and
found
8
Obama
bumper
stickers
on
my
employees
cars
I
have
decided
these
folks
will
be
the
first
to
be
laid
off
I
can't
think
of
another
fair
way
to
approach
this
problem
If
you
have
a
better
idea
let
me
know
I
am
sending
this
letter
to
all
Business
owners
that
I
know
Sincerely
Ward
JOOA

The
right
wing
can't

Factor
of
safety
0.95
by
Jonathan
Kulick
Category
John
McCain
David
Broder
is
the
unchallenged
master
of
the
conventional
wisdom
and
we
need
such
a
tribune
But
this
requiem
for
the
McCain
campaign
is
just
unconventional
folly
The
shortcoming
was
intellectual
as
well
as
bureaucratic
Like
Jimmy
Carter
the
only
Naval
Academy
graduate
to
reach
the
Oval
Office
McCain
had
an
engineer's
approach
to
policymaking
He
had
no
large
principles
that
he
could
apply
to
specific
problems
each
fresh
question
set
off
a
search
for
a
practical
solution
He
instinctively
looked
back
to
Theodore
Roosevelt
and
the
Progressive
era
with
its
high-mindedness
and
disdain
for
the
politics
of
doling
out
favors
to
interest
groups.Yes
in
McCain?s
time
all
plebes
got
a
BS
in
naval
engineering
except
that
he
was
not
much
of
an
engineering
student
and
is
no
engineer
H]e
was
an
academic
misfit
a
literature
and
history
buff
in
nerd
territory
All
the
courses
were
about
naval
boilers
16-inch
guns
electrical
engineering
those
kinds
of
things
McCain
recalled
Did
he
feel
like
he
was
in
the
wrong
place
Sure
as
far
as
the
course
of
study
is
concerned
But
I
also
was
cognizant
that
when
I
graduated
then
I
could
go
fly
airplanes
and
never
have
to
worry
about
naval
boilers
or
16-inch
guns
ever
again."Flying
a
plane
doesn?t
require
solving
the
Navier-Stokes
equations
In
any
event
McCain
was
a
reckless
pilot
I?m
an
engineer
turned
policy
analyst
and
I?m
not
sure
what
an
engineer?s
approach
to
policymaking
is
but
it
surely
is
not
unprincipled
just
use-enough-duct-tape-and-WD-40-to
keep-it-running
Engineers
apply
scientific
principles
to
produce
useful
products
and
processes
They
are
reality-based
solutions
must
meet
constraints
of
physical
laws
available
resources
and
societal
norms
They
validate
the
fruits
of
their
intuition
and
creativity
by
rigorous
testing
Not
a
bad
approach
to
policymaking
I
expect
that
McCain
appreciates
the
comparison
to
Carter
however
inapt
as
much
as
Carter
did
being
called
Jimmy
Hoover
Their
failures
in
leadership
reflect
more
on
their
typical
engineer?s
temperament
than
on
their
approach
to
problem
solving
As
a
legislator
McCain
lacked
a
grand
vision
but
that?s
not
what
engineers
apply
to
solve
problems
Be
grateful
for
that
the
next
time
you
cross
a
bridge
Update
The
National
Society
of
Professional
Engineers
names
eleven
members
of
Congress
who
have
degrees
in
engineering
Hmm
which
senator
is
conspicuous
by
his
absence

More
socialists
for

by

Category
Campaign
2008
Now
it's
The
Economist
That
means
that
even
Sarah
Palin
might
read
it
or
at
least
have
it
read
out
loud
to
her
The
leader-writer
has
some
doubts
about
Obama
no
surprise
from
a
basically
conservatarian
outlet
but
isn't
having
any
McCain
this
time
thank
you
The
Candidate
McCain
of
the
past
six
months
has
too
often
seemed
the
victim
of
political
sorcery
his
good
features
magically
inverted
his
bad
ones
exaggerated
The
fiscal
conservative
who
once
tackled
Mr
Bush
over
his
unaffordable
tax
cuts
now
proposes
not
just
to
keep
the
cuts
but
to
deepen
them
The
man
who
denounced
the
religious
right
as
agents
of
intolerance
now
embraces
theocratic
culture
warriors
The
campaigner
against
ethanol
subsidies
who
had
a
better
record
on
global
warming
than
most
Democrats
came
out
in
favour
of
a
petrol-tax
holiday
It
has
not
all
disappeared
his
support
for
free
trade
has
never
wavered
Yet
rather
than
heading
towards
the
centre
after
he
won
the
nomination
Mr
McCain
moved
to
the
right
Meanwhile
his
temperament
always
perhaps
his
weak
spot
has
been
found
wanting
Sometimes
the
seat-of-the-pants
method
still
works
his
gut
reaction
over
Georgia?to
warn
Russia
off
immediately?was
the
right
one
Yet
on
the
great
issue
of
the
campaign
the
financial
crisis
he
has
seemed
all
at
sea
emitting
panic
and
indecision
Mr
McCain
has
never
been
particularly
interested
in
economics
but
unlike
Mr
Obama
he
has
made
little
effort
to
catch
up
or
to
bring
in
good
advisers
Doug
Holtz-Eakin
being
the
impressive
exception
The
choice
of
Sarah
Palin
epitomised
the
sloppiness
It
is
not
just
that
she
is
an
unconvincing
stand-in
nor
even
that
she
seems
to
have
been
chosen
partly
for
her
views
on
divisive
social
issues
notably
abortion
Mr
McCain
made
his
most
important
appointment
having
met
her
just
twice
Ironically
given
that
he
first
won
over
so
many
independents
by
speaking
his
mind
the
case
for
Mr
McCain
comes
down
to
a
piece
of
artifice
vote
for
him
on
the
assumption
that
he
does
not
believe
a
word
of
what
he
has
been
saying
Once
he
reaches
the
White
House
runs
this
argument
he
will
put
Mrs
Palin
back
in
her
box
throw
away
his
unrealistic
tax
plan
and
begin
negotiations
with
the
Democratic
Congress
That
is
plausible
but
it
is
a
long
way
from
the
convincing
case
that
Mr
McCain
could
have
made
Had
he
become
president
in
2000
instead
of
Mr
Bush
the
world
might
have
had
fewer
problems
But
this
time
it
is
beset
by
problems
and
Mr
McCain
has
not
proved
that
he
knows
how
to
deal
with
them

A
gauzy
feel-good
commercial
by

Category
Lying
in
politics
The
McCain
campaign
dismisses
Obama's
thirty-minute
closing
argument
as
a
gauzy
feel-good
commercial
That
must
have
been
a
canned
response
prepared
in
advance
since
it
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
actual
30
minutes
which
in
fact
focused
on
families
falling
toward
poverty
due
to
illness
not
covered
by
health
insurance
to
jobs
moving
away
and
to
pensions
that
disappear
when
the
firms
go
bankrupt
McCain
might
have
plausibly
though
unwisely
criticized
the
half-hour
as
too
downbeat
too
tear-jerking
not
focused
enough
on
those
who
remain
comfortably
off
But
feel-good
What
color

When
you're
in
a
hole
stop
digging
by
Mark
Kleiman
Category
California
Politics
Mike
O'Hare
has
criticisms
of
Kevin
Drum's
argument
against
the
high
speed
rail
bond
I'm
going
to
get
the
hell
out
of
the
way
and
let
the
experts
argue
this
one
out
But
Mike
makes
two
important
conceptual
points
about
the
structure
of
Kevin's
argument
I
think
both
of
them
are
right
but
on
one
of
them
I
think
Mike
misreads
Kevin's
point
and
misunderstands
the
depth
of
the
state's
permanent
fiscal
crisis
Mike
is
clearly
right
that
high
speed
rail
shouldn't
be
expected
to
pay
for
itself
out
of
the
farebox
Mike
is
also
clearly
right
that
if
we
understand
Kevin's
We
Don't
Have
The
Money
as
referring
to
the
economic
capacity
of
the
people
of
California
to
pay
for
more
public
goods
the
slogan
is
wrong
Californians
can
and
should
pay
higher
taxes
in
order
to
have
a
better
place
to
live
But
as
Mike
acknowledges
the
government
of
California
is
broke
due
to
a
series
of
bad
choices
by
voters
and
officials
going
all
the
way
back
to
Prop
13
Mike
says
that
we
shouldn't
treat
the
unwillingness
of
Californians
to
tax
themselves
adequately
as
a
constraint
because
doing
so
would
simply
ratify
that
choice
Fair
enough
But
it's
equally
true
that
if
every
group
with
a
special
interest
or
a
good
idea
goes
directly
to
the
voters
to
appropriate
money
for
that
group's
pet
cause
while
leaving
the
basic
fiscal
machinery
in
its
current
broken
condition
things
will
only
get
worse
It's
about
time
that
advocates
start
treating
the
voters
as
grown-ups
and
admit
that
we
can't
have
everything
we
want
within
the
current
California
tax
system
Back
when
Ronald
Reagan
was
governor
Eric
Hoffer
said
of
him
Reagan
was
a
B-movie
actor
and
wants
to
run
California
on
a
B-movie
budget
But
California
is
an
A-movie
If
taxes
aren't
raised
then
the
money
to
pay
back
those
bonds
is
going
to
have
to
come
out
of
something
else
Since
K-12
education
has
its
piece
protected
by
a
previous
initiative
that
means
prisons
hard
to
cut
back
on
in
the
short
term
programs
for
the
poor
and
higher
education
That's
not
a
menu
of
options
that
appeals
to
me
but
it's
also
probably
not
a
set
of
threats
that
would
induce
the
voters
to
loosen
the
fiscal
shackles
No
one
has
told
the
voters
yet
and
even
many
politicians
may
not
know
it
but
back
in
the
late
1990s
when
the
state
coffers
were
overflowing
Pete
Wilson
Gray
Davis
and
the
legislature
made
a
decision
to
wreck
the
University
of
California
Instead
of
stumping
up
the
money
to
maintain
the
UC
system
as
the
home
of
four
world-class
universities
places
that
have
for
the
past
thirty
years
competed
with
the
very
best
private
institutions
for
students
and
faculty
they
decided
it
was
more
important
to
try
to
buy
popularity
by
cutting
the
motor
vehicle
registration
fee
So
voting
for
the
high
speed
rail
bonds
without
changing
the
tax
system
is
voting
to
drive
the
state
even
deeper
into
the
hole
It's

Ouch
McCain
pwned
by
Larry
King
by
Mark
Kleiman
Category
John
McCain
Larry
King
interviews
McCain
asks
softball
questions
nods
as
McCain
rolls
out
the
Rashid
Khalidi
nonsense
In
fact
King
didn't
notice
that
the
McCain
had
just
talked
about
the
supposed
suppression
of
the
videotape
which
the
LAT
claims
it
got
on
condition
that
it
would
not
be
shown
and
about
which
the
LAT
published
a
story
months
ago
and
asked
the
next
question
from
his
script
which
allowed
McCain
to
go
through
it
again
It's
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
McCain's
faux-naïf
shtick
convinces
anyone
not
already
convinced
and
he
still
hasn't
learned
to
suppress
entirely
the
signature
smirk
that
means
he
thinks
he
just
scored
a
point
but
for
all
I
know
it
might
be
working
But
I
watched
the
interview
on
a
replay
At
that
point
CNN
cuts
away
from
the
interview
itself
to
footage
of
Larry
King
alone
in
the
studio
looking
into
the
camera
and
reciting
the
CNN
factcheck
showing
that
McCain
is
making
a
fuss
about
nothing
in
particular
Not
helpful
to
the
cause
of
bamboozlement
and
a
strong
suggestion
that
CNN
management
has
had
about
enough
of
being
used
as
a
conveyor
belt
for
slander
Update
Now
this
is
weird
h/t
Sullivan
Shep
Smith
of
Fox
News
tells
Joe
the
Racist
Non-Plumber
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
his
fifteen
minutes
are
up
Note
the
dishonest
game
McCain
and
Palin
play
with
this
loudmouth
Wurzlebacher
can
say
all
sorts
of
ridiculous
stuff
and
never
have
to
defend
it
he
just
drops
into
his
I'm
a
ordinary
guy
and
don't
know
nuthin
act
They
can
then
escape
accountability
for
their
slanders
of
Obama
by
attributing
them
to
Joe
and
treating
any
criticism
of
those
slanders
as
disrespect
for
American
working
people
But
note
more
importantly
that
Fox
News
management
would
never
have
allowed
this
if
the
campaign
still
looked
winnable
for
McCain
And
the
Obama
camp's
strategy
of
going
after
Fox
as
an
arm
of
the
RNC
looks
smarter
and
smarter

California
Initiatives
and
Transit
by
Michael
O'Hare
Category
Economics
Energy
and
Environment
Policy
briefs
Kevin
Drum
posted
his
recs
on
California
initiatives
and
while
they
are
close
to
mine
he
commits
an
error
that
really
makes
me
crazy
and
in
a
followup
Mark
admires
says
two
things
better
than
which
he
should
know
Kevin
doesn't
allow
a
lot
of
chances
to
beat
up
on
him
so
here
goes
The
first
is
the
gong
he
repeatedly
rings
We.Don't.Have.Any.Money
California
per
capita
income
is
about
40k
it's
the
eleventh
richest
state
in
the
US
California
government
doesn't
have
any
money
in
Kevin's
sense
But
a
government
and
the
society
occupying
its
jurisdiction
are
not
at
all
the
same
thing
California
has
lots
of
money
but
so
far
its
citizens
have
chosen
to
spend
about
11
percent
of
it
on
their
state
government
which
is
only
average
for
the
US
This
is
too
bad
because
the
climate
urbanization
and
economy
of
California
justify
a
much
higher
fraction
we
have
more
opportunities
to
come
out
ahead
buying
goods
and
services
through
the
public
sector
than
most
other
states
To
turn
down
an
option
because
it's
intrinsically
bad
is
fine
to
turn
it
down
because
the
state
fiscal
machinery
has
been
wrecked
by
a
bad
constitution
bad
districting
an
irresponsible
governor
and
term
limits
is
just
silly
and
merely
ensures
the
continuation
of
wasteful
failure
to
have
a
government
sized
to
give
us
the
best
package
of
good
stuff
Using
we
carelessly
to
mean
both
our
society
and
our
government
budget
of
the
moment
in
a
sentence
like
Kevin's
is
really
careless
Opposing
the
high
speed
rail
bond
he
makes
two
mistakes
The
first
is
to
say
there
are
better
ways
to
spend
the
money
This
line
is
vacuous
unless
used
of
a
specific
live
alternative
to
the
option
on
the
table
Of
course
there
are
every
single
policy
proposal
that
ever
reaches
the
level
of
viability
represented
by
an
initiative
on
the
ballot
is
inferior
to
something
else
that
will
never
happen
or
is
a
long
way
from
reaching
the
choice
set
of
the
moment
The
argument
if
accepted
is
automatically
and
trivially
fatal
to
anything
under
discussion
Anyway
if
it's
true
and
the
item
on
the
table
has
merit
why
not
just
go
for
both
The
second
is
to
talk
about
the
proposed
rail
line
as
though
it
should
cover
its
costs
at
the
farebox
This
is
not
ideological
it's
just
technically
wrong
public
transportation
is
a
declining
marginal
cost
good
with
a
big
fixed
cost
Charging
marginal
cost
for
these
goods
will
never
cover
their
costs
and
marginal
cost
is
the
right
cost
for
reasons
so
fundamental
I
have
to
trust
readers
to
know
why
a
lot
of
normative
economics
can
be
summed
up
in
the
directive
get
the
prices
to
match
marginal
costs
The
question
about
a
rail
service
or
a
park
or
a
museum
is
whether
the
area
under
the
demand
curve
is
larger
than
the
total
cost
and
it
may
be
that
high
speed
rail
fails
this
test
not
whether
charging
average
cost
will
yield
break-even
revenue
These
goods
are
market
failures
and
will
not
be
provided
efficiently
under
this
kind
of
market
test
no
matter
how
much
right-wingers
bleat
bromides
about
making
government
businesslike
No--one
wants
the
army
to
be
businesslike
in
this
sense
or
the
police
Kevin's
mode
of
attack
on
HSR
would
be
just
as
effective
against
all
the
public
transportation
in
any
city
that
has
it
or
is
building
it
Putting
it
aside
we
need
to
look
at
these
systems
as
public
investments
with
ongoing
public
subsidy
just
like
the
police
station
and
cars
and
the
cops
and
decide
if
they
are
worth
having
on
their
merits
not
by
an
irrelevant
and
misplaced
pricing
test
For
example
you
could
go
to
New
York
Boston
Chicago
London
where
the
good
Brits
are
trashing
their
transit
by
overcharging
for
it
or
Paris
and
show
the
terrible
ghastly
quality
of
life
these
vicious
socialist
networks
inflict
on
their
citizens...for
some
reason
a
lot
of
misguided
tourists
and
residents
seem
to
like
those
places
but
go
figure
No
public
transit
by
the
way
passes
a
conventional
benefit-cost
test
unless
future
quality-of-life
benefits
peculiarly
hard
to
capture
by
multiplying
quantities
by
prices
are
recognized
public
transportation
doesn't
just
displace
some
car
trips
at
the
margin
it
allows
a
whole
new
way
of
living
Just
to
pick
one
example
it
frees
parents
from
having
to
chauffeur
their
children
everywhere
for
twenty
years
and
allows
kids
and
parents
both
to
have
much
more
interesting
and
enriching
lives
High-speed
intercity
rail
at
LA-SF
distances
turns
the
trip
from
i
a
stupefying
six
hours
keeping
a
car
between
two

during
which

Stumble

Bill
Clinton
on
Barack
Obama
by
Quincy
Adams
Category
Campaign
2008
The
informercial
was
quite
affecting
the
calm
narration
by
Obama
himself
was
quite
a
contrast
to
McCain's
crazy
innuendo
of
the
day
But
Bill
Clinton's
intro
at
the
Florida
rally
was
perhaps
even
more
convincing
succinctly
explaining
why
Obama
should
be
elected
again
without
mentioning
McCain
directly
Clinton
discussed
four
areas
that
are
key
to
judging
a
presidency
and
why
Obama
will
be
a
great
president
my
paraphrase
follows
philosophy
Barack
understands
that
America
works
from
the
ground
up
not
the
top
down
The
Republicans
redistributed
wealth
up--the
greatest
amount
since
the
1920's
That
destroys
democracy
We
paid
down
the
debt
We
created
jobs
Barack
will
too
We
made
more
millionaires
and
billionaires
than
they
did
but
you
didn't
know
it
because
middle
class
incomes
and
jobs
were
rising--median
family
income
was
up
now
it's
down
policies
I've
read
all
of
them
and
all
of
McCain's
and
Barack
has
the
right
policies
Barack's
do-list
is
the
better
do-list
The
economic
education
health
care
energy
plans
are
all
better
ability
to
make
a
decision--You
saw
two
presidential
decisions
during
the
campaign
VP
selection
and
financial
crisis
he
took
heat
for
not
saying
much
at
outset
on
financial
crisis
because
he
was
talking
to
experts
to
understand
it
first
He
was
asking
what's
best
for
America
not
what's
best
politics
He
was
saying
you
tell
me
what's
best
and
I'll
figure
out
how
to
sell
it
ability
to
execute
decision
and
make
changes
in
peoples
lives
he
has
executed
campaign
and
brought
people
in
in
a
way
no
one
else
has
ever
done
shows
how
he
can
be
the
best
executor
of
change--the
best
executor
of
good
intentions
the
chief
executive
This
man
should
be
our
president
and
he
will
be
unless
the
American
people
forget
what
the
election
is
about
restoring
the
American
dream
fixing
our
role
in
the
world
and
getting
the
troops
home
and
getting
the
economy
going
The
Obama
campaign
would
do
well
to
make
a
commercial
out
of
this

Admiring
the
Israeli
Political
Class
by
Jonathan
Zasloff
Category
Israel
Now
that
Tzipi
Livni
has
decided
to
hold
elections
in
Israel
I
suppose
that
it
will
be
time
for
observers
from
across
the
spectrum
to
bemoan
the
current
state
of
well
the
State
Israelis
too
like
to
complain
about
their
politicians
especially
their
integrity--or
lack
thereof
But
digger
a
little
deeper
might
reveal
a
sign
of
health
It's
hard
to
feel
great
about
a
country
where
the
most
recent
Prime
Minister
resigned
over
corruption
charges
the
previous
Prime
Minister
might
have
had
to
had
not
a
cerebral
hemorrhage
intervened
his
son
was
convicted
and
the
leader
of
the
Likud
opposition
Benjamin
Netanyahu
faced
constant
corruption
allegations
when
he
held
the
Prime
Minister's
job
from
1996
to
1999
But
maybe
this
is
a
sign
of
strength
If
you
think
about
the
problems
that
Olmert
Netanyahu
and
both
Sharons
have
had
they
all
have
come
from
campaign
finance
problems
Troubling
to
be
sure
but
that
results
from
the
relative
stringency
of
Israeli
law
not
from
the
relative
corruption
of
the
leaders
Israeli
election
law
is
quite
strict
it
is
very
difficult
for
anyone
to
contribute
to
campaigns
I'm
on
the
US
supporting
board
of
the
Israel
Union
for
Environmental
Defense
sort
of
like
NRDC
in
Israel
and
when
the
executive
director
was
discussing
the
problems
of
influencing
the
Knesset
in
my
innocence
I
suggested
forming
something
like
an
Israeli
environment
PAC
She
had
to
explain
to
me
patiently
that
this
simply
isn't
allowed
in
Israel
Put
another
way
what
gets
Israeli
politicians
in
trouble
is
what
American
politicians
do
all
the
time
PACs
soft
money
independent
expenditures
nonprofit
education
foundations
etc
just
can't
be
done
in
Israel
Even
cases
like
former
President
Ezer
Weizman
who
accepted
payments
from
political
friends
could
probably
be
arranged
under
US
law
as
a
sort
of
fancy
sinecure
at
a
fake
think
tank
if
Israeli
law
was
like
American
law
they
just
would
have
made
Weizman
the
Vladimir
Jabotinsky
Fellow
at
the
Bar
Kokhba
Institute
for
Public
Policy
and
he
would
have
gotten
more
money
that
way
Consider
what
happened
after
Israel's
rather
pathetic
2006
war
in
Lebanon
immediately
the
Winograd
Commission
was
formed
and
specifically
held
Olmert
and
Defense
Minister
Amir
Peretz
accountable
for
their
failures
Can
anyone
imagine
a
similar
thing
happening
the
United
States
with
the
Iraq
War
It's
critical
to
look
at
Israel
warts
and
all
And
there
are
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
warts
But
the
political
culture
in
many
ways
is
a
lot
healthier
than
the
conventional
wisdom
holds

The
Best
Political
Piece
of
the
Year
by
Jonathan
Zasloff
Category
Politics
and
Leadership
The
permanent
campaign
I'm
not
sure
what
it
says
that
GQ
is
quickly
becoming
a
go-to
blog
about
politics
but
it
is
Larry
Platt
the
editor
of
Philadelphia
magazine
briefly
ran
for
Congress
last
year
in
suburban
Philadelphia
before
dropping
out
Why
did
he
drop
out
Not
because
he
couldn't
win--but
because
he
could
It's
so
far
the
best
political
piece
I
have
read
this
year
Consider
this
account
of
his
meeting
with
House
Majority
Leader
Steny
Hoyer
whom
he
has
to
persuade
to
support
him
after
getting
support
from
local
Congressman
Bob
Brady
Mr
Platt
Goes
to
Washington
Steny
Hoyer
the
House
Majority
Leader
is
a
serious
formal
man
He?s
not
the
kind
of
guy
you
want
to
drink
a
beer
with
He?s
more
the
kind
of
guy
who
oversees
the
licensing
of
those
who
would
serve
you
beer
County
Party
Chair
Marcel
Groen
and
I
had
come
down
to
D.C
to
schmooze
national
party
leaders
So
here
I
was
sitting
on
a
sofa
in
Hoyer?s
spacious
Capitol
Hill
office
After
introductory
pleasantries
there
was
an
awkward
silence
I
decided
to
fill
it
with
my
by-now
practiced
routine
When
you?re
a
journalist
I
began
you?re
on
the
sidelines
At
some
point
you
want
to
get
in
the
game
I
paused
Hoyer
didn?t
jump
in
I
babbled
on
I
pulled
out
a
Bobby
Kennedy
quote
Hoyer
was
impassive
I
talked
about
how
I
knew
the
Sixth
District
to
be
politically
moderate
and
yet
populist
Nada
I
said
that
if
elected
I
would
refuse
the
House?s
health
coverage
Zip
I
made
the
mistake
of
saying
a
local
radio
talk-show
host
Michael
Smerconish
a
well-known
Republican
has
his
finger
on
the
pulse
of
my
district
fiscally
conservative
tough
on
terror
libertarian
on
social
issues
At
which
point
my
chaperone
Groen
interrupted
Well
he?s
a
bit
conservative
to
our
liking
but
what
Larry?s
saying
is
there?s
an
opening
against
Gerlach
in
terms
of
the
war
on
terror
With
this
Groen
saved
me
from
appearing
to
actually
like
a
Republican
Little
did
I
know
that
inside
the
way-too-partisan
Beltway
that?s
a
capital
offense
When
I
was
done
Hoyer
leaned
forward
and
dispensed
his
words
of
wisdom
If
Bob
Brady
vouches
for
you
that?s
good
enough
for
me
he
said
That
was
it
Read
the
whole

It
Tragedy
doesn't
scale
by
Jonathan
Kulick
Category
Georgia
No
one
knows
how
many
people?civilians
or
combatants?were
killed
in
the
battle
for
Tskhinvali
and
both
self-serving
and
independent
estimates
have
varied
widely
since
the
conflict
escalated
in
early
August
The
BBC
now
reports
that
The
Russian
prosecutor's
office
is
investigating
more
than
300
possible
cases
of
civilians
killed
by
the
Georgian
military
Some
of
those
may
be
Ossetian
paramilitaries
but
Human
Rights
Watch
believes
the
figure
of
300-400
civilians
is
a
useful
starting
point
That
would
represent
more
than
1
of
the
population
of
Tskhinvali?the
equivalent
of
70,000
deaths
in
London
This
sort
of
equivalence
is
often
cited
to
convey
the
impact
of
a
loss
on
the
local
population
whether
in
Iraq
Thus
violence
killed
300
Iraqis
last
week
the
equivalent
proportionately
of
3,300
Americans,or
in
Israel
Israel?s
generals
warn
that
if
the
Arabs
strike
first
tiny
Israel
could
suffer
40,000
dead
the
American
equivalent
of
nearly
three
million).This
may
be
a
useful
rhetorical
device
in
some
narrow
demographic
sense
but
how
difficult
is
it
to
grasp
one
percent
And
there?s
a
difference
between
distributed
ongoing
casualties?as
in
Iraq
at
the
time
of
that
article?and
what
is
essentially
a
single
incident
In
the
former
case
the
comparison
to
the
U.S
gives
a
sense
of
the
incidence
of
violent
death
if
it
were
to
strike
widely
and
frequently
People
often
understand
frequency-based
explanations
better
than
rate-based
This
analogy
is
likely
to
sensationalize
an
already
grave
matter
Individual
lives
are
not
worth
more
because
the
victims
come
from
a
small
community
A
car
crash
in
Liechtenstein
that
kills
four
people
leaves
four
people
dead?it
is
not
equivalent
to
an
earthquake
in
China
that
kills
150,000
though
each
is
a
comparable
share
of
the
total
population
300
dead
or
whatever
the
true
figure
turns
out
to
be
is
terrible
enough
but
the
moral
culpability
is
not
the
same
as
for
whomever
might
kill
70,000
civilians
in
London
On
the
other
hand
thinking
about
70,000
dead
in
London
might
harden
the
BBC
listener?s
heart
one
dead
man
is
death
two
million
are
only
a
statistic
Remarque?not
Stalin
Update
It
seems
that
Jordan
Ellenberg
took
up
this
issue
a
few
years
ago
I
was
a
math
teammate
of
his
he
was
much
younger
and
much
smarter
than
I
so
I'm
not
about
to
take
issue
with
his
analysis

California
ballot
measures
Kevin
Drum
explains
it
all
for
you
by
Mark
Kleiman
Category
California
Politics
I
wasn't
looking
forward
to
writing
a
post
on
all
the
California
ballot
initiatives
so
I'm
grateful
to
Kevin
Drum
for
doing
it
for
me
It
will
save
wear
and
tear
on
your
brain
if
you
just
vote
as
Kevin
suggests
I
wasn't
fully
persuaded
to
vote
against
the
high-speed
rail
measure
just
because
high-speed
rail
is
such
a
great
idea
generically
in
terms
of
congestion
pollution
and
stress
reduction
Kevin
having
telepathically
divined
my
skepticism
provides
a
devastating
follow-up
post
I'm
still
not
sure
how
I'm
going
to
vote
on
Proposition
5
the
extension
of
the
drug-treatment-instead-of-prison
program
formerly
known
as
Proposition
36
The
proposition
is
just
as
bad
as
Kevin
says
it
is
and
in
some
ways
worse
details
at
the
jump
but
if
you
were
to
decide
that
you
like
cannabis
decrime
and/or
just
want
to
send
a
dovish
message
about
the
drug
war
to
politicians
in
California
and
elsewhere
I
wouldn't
call
that
entirely
unreasonable
Still
the
proposition
is
a
crock
and
government
by
initiative
petition
is
a
rotten
idea
in
general
I've
been
wavering
on
this
one
with
violent
convictions
in
each
direction
on
alternate
days
I
may
have
to
flip
a
coin
before
I
go
to
vote
Footnote
Now
would
be
as
good
a
time
as
any
to
notice
what
a
blessing
it
is
to
have
someone
as
smart
and
sane
and
calm
as
Kevin
Drum
around
the
blogosphere
If
he
didn't
exist
they'd
definitely
have
to
invent
him

McCain's
Redistributionist
Complaint
by
Robert
Frank
Category
Campaign
2008
John
McCain
There?s
already
been
lots
of
sensible
pushback
against
John
McCain?s
charge
that
Barack
Obama
is
a
redistributionist
At
the
risk
of
piling
on
here?s
another
story
that
illustrates
just
how
bizarre
the
charge
is
Some
months
ago
I
was
asked
to
join
a
panel
to
review
The
National
Council
on
Economic
Education?s
curriculum
standards
for
the
teaching
of
essential
principles
of
economics
a
task
not
normally
entrusted
to
Marxists
On
a
conference
call
last
Friday
the
panel
debated
the
Council?s
content
standards
including
Content
Standard
16
which
reads
in
part
There
is
an
economic
role
for
government
in
a
market
economy
whenever
the
benefits
of
a
government
policy
outweigh
its
costs
Governments
often
provide
for
national
defense
address
environmental
concerns
define
and
protect
property
rights
and
attempt
to
make
markets
more
competitive
Most
government
policies
also
redistribute
income
Discussion
focused
on
a
proposal
by
one
of
the
panel
members
to
change
Most
to
Many
in
the
last
sentence
of
this
standard
I
asked
whether
anyone
could
think
of
a
government
policy
that
didn't
entail
at
least
some
degree
of
direct
or
indirect
redistribution
of
income
No
one
could
which
is
hardly
surprising
since
government
policies
are
paid
for
by
taxes
and
create
benefits
and
costs
that
generally
fall
unevenly
on
different
people
In
practice
not
every
government
policy
meets
the
cost-benefit
test
described
in
Content
Standard
16
But
no
one
could
come
up
with
even
a
single
example
of
a
government
expenditure?not
for
a
highway
guard
rail
not
for
a
bridge
repair
not
for
an
influenza
vaccine
not
for
any
other
specific
purpose?whose
net
costs
and
benefits
were
exactly
equal
for
each
and
every
citizen
In
short
there
is
a
more
plausible
case
for
changing
Most
to
All
than
for
changing
Most
to
Many
in
the
last
sentence
of
Content
Standard
16
Rather
than
push
the
envelope
though
we
voted
to
let
the
current
wording
stand
If
all
government
policies
have
distributional
consequences
it
makes
no
sense
to
complain
that
a
politician
favors
redistribution
When
John
McCain
appears
on
a
talk
show
this
Sunday
his
interviewer
should
ask
him
whether
all
the
policies
he?s
supported
during
his
years
in
office
that
have
had
no
effect
on
the
distribution
of
income
among
his
constituents
Unless
the
answer
is
no
then
McCain
too
is
a
redistributionist

Ignoring
mpg
by
James
Wimberley
Category
Energy
and
Environment
Pat
and
I
have
just
hired
a
car
in
the
UK
for
10
days
a
Peugeot
308
a
proper
4-seater
with
a
non-trivial
boot
and
a
turbo-diesel
engine
generally
a
nice
car
The
onboard
computer
told
us
the
fuel
consumption
for
a
mixed
cycle
of
town
country
and
motorway
driving
was
54
Imperial
mpg
or
45
US
mpg
It
hadn't
been
zeroed
between
hires
so
the
value
covered
2000
miles
Not
bad
and
comparable
to
what
you
can
expect
from
a
Toyota
Prius
hybrid
Peugeot
along
with
other
European
carmakers
are
working
on
diesel
hybrids
they
promise
83
Imperial
mpg
for
the
comparable
model
due
in
2010
or
69
US
mpg
It's
a
puzzle
why
US
drivers
are
so
set
against
diesels
They
are
now
as
quiet
and
flexible
as
the
petrol
engines
of
20
years
ago
have
low
particle
emissions
and
better
consumption
The
main
thought
this
experience
has
triggered
is
the
insight
that
miles
per
gallon
is
now
an
obsolete
and
misleading
measure

Public
programs
for
the
prosperous
by
Mark
Kleiman
Category
Microeconomics
and
policy
analysis
There's
been
lots
of
discussion
so
far
this
campaign
about
the
distribution
of
the
tax
burden
as
between
the
rich
and
the
rest
of
us
Not
enough
discussion
I'd
say
about
the
distribution
between
the
merely
prosperous
and
the
90-something
percent
of
the
population
below
them
on
the
income
scale
But
that's
only
half
the
discussion
about
the
distributional
side
of
taxation
and
spending
How
should
the
benefits
of
public
programs
be
allocated
among
the
income
classes
Now
if
you're
a
good
liberal
as
I
often
am
your
immediate
response
will
be
As
much
as
possible
to
the
poor
who
need
it
most
as
little
as
possible
to
the
rich
who
need
it
least
I
want
to
argue
that
our
common
impulse
is
analytically
wrong
It's
right
about
cash
transfers
of
course
or
their
equivalents
in
policies
that
monkey
with
relative
prices
But
what
about
programs
that
actually
produce
goods
services
and
amenities
There
the
question
gets
more
complicated
Rich
people
are
willing
to
pay
a
lot
for
what
they
want
that's
why
the
luxury-goods
trade
can
live
nicely
off
such
a
tiny
demographic
slice
But
that's
no
less
true
when
it
comes
to
publicly-provided
stuff
a
rich
person
may
not
enjoy
clean
air
or
quiet
or
high-quality
television
programming
any
more
than
a
normal
person
but
his
willingness-to-pay
is
much
higher
simply
because
the
opportunity
cost
of
a
dollar
is
lower
when
you
already
have
a
bunch
of
them
Here's
one
way
to
think
of
it
there
are
undoubtedly
public
goods
that
rich
and
prosperous
people
enjoy
enough
so
that
they
would
support
providing
them
even
if
those
programs
were
supported
by
a
special
tax
on
the
well-off
And
the
question
whether
to
impose
that
rich-guy
tax
to
fund
a
bunch
of
rich-guy
programs
is
logically
distinct
from
the
question
of
how
much
to
tax
the
well-off
for
programs
that
help
the
not-so-well-off
Candidate
programs
might
include
saving
endangered
species
high
culture
including
both
pure
science
and
the
arts
and
the
educational
enterprises
that
support
them
health
and
especially
longevity
research
public
buildings
that
don't
look
as
if
they
were
built
by
the
low
bidder
noise
reduction
air
quality
both
for
health
and
for
visibility
wilderness
preservation
space
exploration
and
economic
aid
to
poor
countries
I
say
might
because
as
far
as
I
know
there's
very
little
attention
paid
to
figuring
out
what
rich
people
really
want
that
only
the
government
can
provide
That
leads
to
inefficiency
at
best
and
to
Republicanism
at
worst

Now
that
Sen
Stevens
is
a
convicted
felon
by
Mark
Kleiman
Category
Palin
what
does
Gov
Palin
have
to
say
about
the
man
who
made
a
commercial
for
her
when
she
ran
for
Governor
two
short
years
ago
At
latest
report
she
hadn't
decided
whether
to
endorse
this
notorious
porkmeister
and
crook
for
re-election
or
not
in
what
would
have
been
had
he
been
acquitted
a
close
race
Palin's
only
post-conviction
comment
was
that
she
was
confident
that
Senator
Stevens
will
do
what?s
right
for
the
people
of
Alaska
That
was
after
Stevens
proclaimed
his
innocence
and
declared
that
he
was
still
a
candidate
for
re-election
She
ignored
reporters
questions
about
whether
she
would
vote
for
her
old
mentor
Now
that's
what
I
call
a
maverick
reformer

After
moving
to
Los
Angeles
I
found
the
Original
Painless
Dentist
Contact
information
available
on
request
The
only
time
she
ever
hurt
me
was
when
she
told
me
she
was
a
Republican
I've
been
working
on
her
to
vote
for
Obama
without
any
real
expectation
of
success
Today
she
said
with
resignation
but
without
any
prompting
from
me
Well
you
just
can't
vote
for
McCain

Watching
Conservatives
Megan
McArdle
who
is
usually
a
more
careful
reader
and
Glenn
Reynolds
who
usually
isn't
both
accuse
me
of
urging
the
prosecution
of
the
wingnuts
who
have
been
submitting
false-name
contributions
on
the
Obama
website
and
criticize
me
for
trying
to
use
the
power
of
law
enforcement
to
suppress
criticism
the
people
I
support
politically
Just
one
thing
Nowhere
in
the
post
they
refer
to
reproduced
in
full
after
the
jump
do
I
say
a
syllable
about
prosecution
I
merely
point
out
that
the
activity
violates
the
law
which
means
that
people
doing
it
shouldn't
crow
quite
so
loudly
Of
course
no
actual
investigator
or
prosecutor
would
waste
his
time
working
on
a
case
involving
a
5
contribution
to
Obama
in
the
name
of
Mickey
Mouse
Neither
Megan
who
isn't
a
lawyer
nor
Glenn
who
is
bothers
to
offer
any
reason
why
the
activity
in
question
which
both
of
them
have
publicized
and
praised
doesn't
constitute
wire
fraud
as
defined
in
the
statute
Now
in
case
you're
in
any
doubt
I
know
perfectly
well
how
to
demand
a
prosecution
when
I
think
it's
appropriate
For
example
in
discussing
the
illegal
intrusions
into
Joe
the
non)Plumber's
motor
vehicle
records
I
wrote
At
least
three
people
almost
certainly
broke
the
law
And
they
ought
to
go
to
jail
for
it
The
people
making
those
phony
contributions
shouldn't
go
to
jail
But
they
should
stop
bragging
about
their
criminal
activity
As
to
the
prosecution
of
political
enemies
I
wonder
if
Glenn
has
ever
heard
of
Don
Siegelman
If
so
he's
never

my
knowledge

Is
this
really
the
best
the
wingers
and
their
tame
press
and
their
adopted
candidate
can
do
in
the
way
of

scandal
Obama
would
like
people
who
aren't
rich
to
get
a
fairer
shake
than
they
now
get
He
thinks
those

need
to
be
made
by
the
voters
through
their
elected

not
through

He
thinks
it
was

tragedy
that
the

movement
having
accomplished
important
expansions
of

through

Here's
Douglas
Holtz-Eakin
the
formerly
respectable
McCain
economic
adviser
who
will
spend
the
next
several
years
wondering
where
he
left
his
intellectual
integrity
and
his
reputation
Warning
you
may
need
to
shower
after
reading
this
The
American
people
continue
to
learn
more
about
Barack
Obama
Now
we
know
that
the
slogans
change
you
can
believe
in
and
change
we
need
are
code
words
for
Barack
Obama's
ultimate
goal
redistributive
change
In
a
previously
uncovered
interview
from
September
6
2001
Barack
Obama
expressed
his
regret
that
the
Supreme
Court
hadn't
been
more
radical
and
described
as
a
tragedy
the
Court's
refusal
to
take
up
the
issues
of
redistribution
of
wealth
No
wonder
he
wants
to
appoint
judges
that
legislate
from
the
bench
as
insurance
in
case
a
unified
Democratic
government
under
his
control
fails
to
meet
his
basic
goal
taking
money
away
from
people
who
work
for
it
and
giving
it
to
people
who
Barack
Obama
believes
deserve
it
Europeans
call
it
socialism
Americans
call
it
welfare
and
Barack
Obama
calls
it
change
Update
Volokh
Conspirator
Orin
Kerr
is
a
serious
conservative
and
a
serious
law
professor
and
he
has
no
time
for
Drudge's
foolishness
Well
worth
reading
When
winter
comes
you
learn
which
trees
are
evergreens
And
it's
when
a
party
or
an
ideology
has
a
well-earned
electoral
meltdown
that
you
can
easily
distinguish
the
honest
grown-ups
from
the
children
and
the
hacks
Kerr
can't
be
bothered
to
pretend
that
Obama
is
a
fringe
radical
or
an
incompetent
any
more
than
Ken
Adelman

a

who

preposterous
Sure
Pinkerton
doesn?t
actually
say
that
because
then
it?d
be
obvious
that
the
post
is
a
parody
Attending
to
dreary
reality
Pinkerton
says
that
Alinsky
dedicated
Rules

to
Lucifer
Actually
he
dedicated
the
book
to

which
is
not
one
of

many
names
for

John
McCain
Lying
in
politics
Yep
that's
the
word
for
McCain
these
days
Don't
believe
me
Then
believe
Ann
Althouse
The
whole
socialist
thing
is
so
wrong
on
so
many
levels
it's
hard
to
get
started
First
it's
obviously
grossly
ludicrously
false
Obama
does
not
believe
in
state
ownership
of
the
means
of
production
He
believes
in
a
state
that
makes
capitalism
work
for
everyone
When
he
thinks
about
economic
policy
Obama's
first
move
is
toward
Alexander
Hamilton
who
invented
what
is
now
called
the
mixed
economy
before
anyone
had
ever
heard
of
socialism
Second
McCain
doesn't
really
believe
it
First
he
cites
his
vote
against
the
Bush
tax
cuts
as
evidence
that
he's
a
maverick
Then
he
cites
Obama's
opposition
to
extending
those
cuts
as
evidence
that
Obama
is
a
socialist
Or
it's
because
Obama
offers
refundable
tax
credits
when
refundable
tax
credits
are
at
the
center
of
McCain's
own
health
care
plan
This
stuff
doesn't
pass
the
giggle
test
Third
and
most
of
all
socialist
as
a
campaign
issue
has
nothing
to
do
with
economic
policy
at
all
Because
the
oligarchs
of
Soviet
Union
and
the
rest
of
the
Leninist/Stalinist/Maoist
world
and
their
Western
apologists
used
socialist
as
a
label
for
their
mix
of
state
capitalism
with
tyranny
during
the
Cold
War
calling
someone
a
socialist
was
a
way
of
challenging
that
person's
loyalty
Socialist
in
the
context
of
McCain's
attack
on
Obama
has
no
real
reference
to
an
economic
theory
it's
just
part
of
the
attempt
to
make
Obama
into
the
Scary
Other
the
black
nationalist
terrorist
radical
Muslim
Marxist
Chicago
machine
politician
vote-stealer
fake
Messiah
baby-killer
pervert
alien
cosmopolitan
European
celebrity
elitist
Now
James
Pinkerton
adds
Satanist
No
seriously
No
wonder
an
intellectual
like
Althouse
can't
parse
what
McCain
is
saying
And
good
for
her
for
having
the
nerve
to
say
so
But
the
message
isn't
incoherent
just
because
McCain
is
exhausted
or
sick
Yes
McCain
does
seem
to
suffer
from
a
certain
shall
we
say
lack
of
focus
But
that
merely
makes
it
harder
for
McCain
to
conceal
the
fact
that
there's
no
actual
thought
behind
the
fear-mongering
Give
someone
smart
Althouse
for
example
the
assignment
of
explaining
the
sense
in
which
Barack
Obama
is
a
socialist
and
she
couldn't
really
do
any
better
at
it
There's
simply
no
there
there

Trackers
for
the
Judy
Feder
campaign
trying
to
ask
a
question
of
Congressman
Frank
Wolf
are
assaulted
and
beaten
by
Wolf's
people
one
of
them
using
a
cane
which
in
most
states
counts
as
a
deadly
weapon
making
a
simple
A&B
into
aggravated
assault
a
felony
The
editors
of
the
Washington

seem
unconcerned
apparently
pork
for
Northern
Virginia
is
more
important
than
political
violence
or
for
that
matter
Feder's
superb
qualifications
as
a
genuine
expert
on
health
care
Of
course
since
this
was
actual
violence
rather
than
made-up
violence
CNN
isn't
likely
to
carry
it
Bonus
fact
Wolf
used
to
chair
the

Human

Caucus
I
guess
free

doesn't
count
If
watching

makes
you
angry
here's
a
good
vent
for
that
anger
Note
to
Democrats
Send
the
trackers
out
in
pairs
so
that
one
tracker
can
point
a
camera
to
record
the
violence
against

other
And

crap
happens

straight

out
the
basic
fact
of
the
campaign
from
here
With
fewer
than
ten
days
to
go
until
the

John

is
another
day
older
and
deeper
in

polls
Any
day
in
which
John
McCain
doesn't
close
a
full
percentage
point
of
the
gap
is
a
lost
day
for
him
And
it's
hard
to
see
how
he
makes
any
significant
news
especially
if
he
can't
get
any
more
coherent
than
he
was
on

the
Press
Not
a
good

play
From

this

College

Category
Lying
in

Michael
Fuoco
of
the
Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette
has
a
retrospective
on
the
Ashley
Todd
affair
It
makes
for
very
sad
reading
I
wonder
whether
the
College
Republicans
knew
when
they
hired
Todd
that
she's
been
fired
from
the
Ron
Paul
campaign
for
acts
of
deception
TPM
blogger
astral66
makes
a
very
nice
catch
since
the
photographer
who
took
the
picture
first
posted
on
Drudge
who
had
met
Ashley
Todd
at
a
College
Republicans
mixer
only
gave
it
to
the
police
and
the
College
Republicans
and
since
Drudge
had
it
before
there
was
any
announcement
from
the
police
guess
who
gave
it
to
Drudge
Will
John
McCain
denounce
the
College
Republicans
And
while
he's
at
it
will
he
denounce
his
Pennsylvania
communications
director
Bonus
moment
Ms
Todd's
job
as
a
field
representative
for
the
College
Republican
National
Committee
brought
her
to
Pittsburgh
about
two
weeks
ago
to
recruit
college
students
She
had
worked
for
the
committee
since
August
Yesterday
the
organization
fired
her
Ashley
Barbera
the
organization's
communications
director
said
workers
initially
were
concerned
for
Ms
Todd's
safety
We
are
as
upset
as
anyone
to
learn
of
her
deceit
Ashley
must
take
full
responsibility
for
her
actions
she
said
Get
that
This
mentally
ill
woman
must
take
full
responsibility
for
her
actions
but
the
College
Republicans
who
have
a
long
tradition
of
ratf*cking
Nixon's
dirty
tricksters
and
Karl
Rove
got
their
start
with
the
CRs
take
no
responsibility
for
hiring
her
or
for
pushing
her
story
How
hard
would
it
have
been
to
look
at
Todd's
MySpace
page
where
she
said
Lying
is
the
most
fun
a
girl
can
have
without
taking
her
cloths
off
They
used
her
and
now
they're
throwing
her
away

Licenses
by
Michael
O'Hare
Category
Economics
Policy
briefs
Mark's
justification
for
prohibiting
unlicensed
persons
from
doing
plumbing
needs
a
little
more
unpacking
though
it
wasn't
the
point
of
his
post
First
some
nice
words
about
plumbers
I
don't
have
the
citation
but
I
read
somewhere
that
if
you
separate
the
drinking
water
from
the
sewage
which
is
precisely
what
plumbers
do
and
what
most
of
the
plumbing
code
provisions
are
designed
to
assure
you
double
life
expectancy
from
35
to
about
70
adding
all
of
medicine's
wonders
gets
you
maybe
another
five
Pipefitters
do
stuff
like
gas
steam
and
chemical
um
pipefitting
which
is
all
good
but
off
the
topic
here
Framing
licensing
laws
as
prohibitions
is
important
nothing
obliges
Joe
to
have
a
plumbing
license
or
any
other
kind
of
a
license
Actually
in
most
jurisdictions
you
don't
even
need
such
a
license
to
do
plumbing
as
long
as
it's
in
your
own
house
That
prohibition
is
against
occupying
the
house
unless
you
got
a
permit
to
do
the
work
with
an
inspection
by
the
city
an
inspection
that
applies
also
to
all
work
by
licensed
plumbers
and
in
principle
makes
the
license
redundant
So
subsequent
buyers
of
houses
owned
by
reasonably
handy
people
are
not
protected
by
licensing
requirements
but
by
a
different
complex
of
convention
and
law
including
not
just
inspections
and
permits
but
also
the
difficulty
owing
to
thread
and
pipe
sizes
for
example
of
putting

The
brevity
of
their

in

so

has
made
it
impossible
to

what
this
is
I'm
not
entirely
a

about

definitely
not

to
sweep
away
all
professional
licensing
inspectors
can't
always
see
everything
But
we
certainly
do
too
much
of
it
Let's
remember
that
forbidding
unlicensed
plumbers
to
do
plumbing
as
paid
work
for
others
is
motivated
at
least
in
part
by
its
very
salutary
effect
on
everyone
inside
the
tent
licensed
keeping
prices
high
by
suppressing
competition
Getting
the
state
to
force
your
competitors
out
of
business
is
like
actually
out-competing
them
to
gain
market
share
but
cheaper
and
you
get
to
do
it
in
nice
clothes
in
fancy
restaurants
in
the
state
capital
instead
of
under
someone's
house
in
Carhartts

The
ghost
of
the
late
great
Mancur
Olson
here
reminds
us
that
the
members
of
such
groups
are
few
have
high
stakes
in
policy
and
know
who
they
are
while
the
rest
of
us
are
diffuse
many
and
have
low
per
capita
stakes
Guess
who
wins
Many
trades
like
the
fellowship
of
suers
pleaders
and
briefwrights
have
even
arranged
for
the
members
of
their
group
to
be
the
sole
judges
of
who
can
join
their
legally
protected
monopoly
and
on
what
terms
which
is
not
just
rent-seeking
but
bumper-harvest
rent-gathering
Tilting
the
pinball
machine
of
business
one's
own
way
is
why
hairdressers
and
manicurists
often
exhibit
such
a
powerful
drive
to
protect
the
public
in
this
way
and
why
people
who
have
not
yet
succeeded
in
getting
these
protections
enacted
for
themselves
often
gin
up
alternate
paths
to
the
same
end
like
requiring
certain
jobs
in
government
to
be
held
by
people
with
this
or
that
degree
planners
and
teachers
for
example
or
using
union
membership
similarly
I
must
at
this
point
clarify
the
precise
scope
of
the
foregoing
argument
lest
our
readers
be
misled
For
extremely
arcane
but
absolutely
incontrovertible
reasons
much
too
technical
to

keep

thank
you
three

three
professional
identities
completely
satisfy
the
most
rigorous
theoretical
and
empirical
standards
for
very
strict
licensing
namely
architects
engineers
and
university
professors
Maybe
college
professors
if
they
behave
in
a
deferential
fashion
and
pay
some
extra
dues
To
even
consider
that
just
anyone
be
permitted
to
wield
the
sacred
instruments

mysteries
of
these
three
callings
is
to

The

Non-Plumber
ought
to
have
been
immune
from
criticism
after
he
chose
to
make

is
absurd
But
invading
his

by
using
the

to

his

is
as
it
should
be
should
be
a
crime
Naturally
the
McCain

is
charging
the
Obama
campaign
with
complicity
So
far
there's
no
basis
in
fact
for
that
charge
but
that's
true
of
most
of
what
McCain
has
said
about

this
year

Still
at

three

they

In

Race
desperation
and
Ashley
Todd
by
Mark
Kleiman
Category
Crime
Control
Election
2008
Lying
in
politics
Hilzoy
posts
some
characteristically
thoughtful
reflections
on
the
Ashley
Todd
hoax
Well
worth
reading
especially
on
the
psychology
of
being
on
the
losing
side
in
a
high-stakes
campaign
One
one
point
though
I
think
Hilzoy
goes
astray
Having
developed
a
theory
of
what
might
have
been
behind
Todd's
confabulation
she
says
What
I
can't
think
my
way
into
is
her
saying
that
the
person
who
did
it
was
black
No
kind
of
desperation
that
I
can
think
of
would
have
required
that
detail
That's
just
gratuitous
and
very
very
ugly
Gratuitous
That
suggests
that
Todd
could
have
chosen
to
tell
the
same
story
about
a
white
mugger
with
a
fanatical
hatred
of
McCain
supporters
I
don't
see
it
First
without
the
racial
element
the
story
would
have
had
much
less
political
potency
The
country
does
not
have
ingrained
fears
of
violent
Democrats
or
violent
Obama
fans
It
does
have
ingrained
fears
of
criminally
violent
black
men
Part
of
the
resistance
to
having
a
black
President
is
the
fear
that
black
people
will
imagine
that
as
a
license
to
take
revenge
on
white
people
So
as
a
pure
campaign
stunt
race
was
as
the
lawyers
say
of
the
essence
Second
since
the
victim
had
to
choose
a
race
for
the
imaginary
robber
black
was
the
most
plausible
answer
According
to
surveys
of
crime
victims
half
of
all
robberies
in
the
United
States
are
committed
by
black
people
In
Pittsburgh
where
the
proportion
of
African-Americans
in
the
population
is
about
twice
the
national
average
a
robber
is
far
more
likely
to
be
black
than
white
Indeed
the
victim's
made-up
description
actually
matched
that
of
someone
who
had
been
carrying
out
ATM
robberies
in
the
area
I
doubt
that
there
was
a
6'4
200-lb
white
ATM-mugging
suspect
in
the
police
data-base
Third
why
should
we
doubt
that
Ashley
Todd
adds
racism
to
her
other
psychological
problems
She
probably
told
the
story
as
she
imagined
it
the
mugger
in
her
mind
was
naturally
African-American
and
dark-skinned
at
that
just
as
he
was
naturally
young
male
big
and
tall
So
given
Ashley
Todd's
crazy
plan
to
invent
a
crime
of
political
violence
the
racial
aspect
of
the
story
followed
naturally
And
as
Hilzoy
points
out
with
less
diligent
police
work
it
might
have
served
its
political
ends

Senator
McCain?s
quest
for
the
presidency
is
over
by
Mark
Kleiman
Category
Campaign
2008
So
said
John
Moody
Executive
VP
of
Fox
News
yesterday
If
course
there
was
an
if
If
the
incident
i.e
the
alleged
B
for
Barack
slashing
turns
out
to
be
a
hoax
Of
course
that
if
has
now
come
to
pass
The
incident
has
turned
out
to
be
a
hoax
The
poor
confused
girl
who
made
the
false
police
report
has
now
been
arrested
And
the
McCain
campaign
is
rapidly
backing
away
The
McCain
Pennsylvania
spokesman
quoted
by
two
different
media
outlets
as
retailing
the
B
for
Barack
story
seems
to
have
disappeared
but
another
McCain
spokesman
is
now
saying
that
both
reporters
got
it
wrong
attributing
to
the
McCain
guy
things
actually
said
by
the
police
But
one
of
the
reporters
still
has
his
notes
And
in
any
case
two
misquotations
of
the
same
person
by
two
different
reporters
is
a
coincidence
as
hard
to
credit
as
Ashley
Todd's
original
confabulation
Moody
was
right
at
this
point
the
McCain
campaign
deserves
to
be
over
forever
linked
to
race-baiting

will

anyone
but
Olbermann

way

Concerning

terrorism
by

Category

2008
Campaign
2008
I'm
glad
to
know
that
there
haven't
been
any
completed
murders
of
abortion
workers
in
the
U.S
in
a
decade
though
there
have
been
a
stabbing
two
bombings
and
twenty-three
arsons
since
then
One
reason
for
the
reduction
of
anti-abortion
violence
resembles
the
reason
for
the
reduction
of
killings
of
Sunnis
by
Shi'a
in
Iraq
Just
as
Sunnis
have
largely
left
the
areas
where
they
were
most
likely
to
be
killed
abortion
clinics
have
shut
down
in
most
of
the
areas
where
they
were
most
likely
to
be
blown
up
Since
1982
the
number
of
providers
has
shrunk
by
more
than
a
third
nationwide
and
four
out
of
five
counties
in
the
U.S
accounting
for
a
third
of
the
population
have
no
provider
at
all
In
any
case
deadly
threats
aimed
at
abortion
providers
unlike
for
example
bombs
planted
in
opposition
to
the
War
in
Vietnam
remain
a
live
fact
about
life
in
the
United
States
So
when
Sarah
Palin
refuses
to
call
clinic
bombers
terrorists
it's
hard
to
take
seriously
her
pretended
moral
outrage
about
the
fact
that
Barack
Obama
served
on
a
foundation
board
with
someone
who
had
been
an
anti-war
bomber
never
involved
in
a
fatal
incident
thirty
years
earlier
h/t
Glenn
Reynolds
who
as
usual
misses
the
point
Footnote
To
be
clear
I
think
the
fact
that
Bill
Ayers
due
in
large
part
to
his
connections
with
the
Chicago
economic
elite
his
father
ran
the
local
electric
utility
was
allowed
back
into
what
passes
for
decent
society
there
reflects
badly
on
the
morals
of
elite
Chicagoans
But
shunning
the
practitioners
of
political
violence
has
never
been
as
strong
a
norm
as
I
would
like
it
to
be
in
American
politics
For
example
there
has
never
been
a
clean
line
between
Cuban-American
politics
in
Miami
and
anti-Castro
terrorism
in
Miami
but
that
didn't
keep
every
national
office-seeker
from
kissing
Jorge
Mas
Canosa's
ring
Going
back
a
little
further
in
time
how
many
Southern
Governors
of
the
1950s
and
1960s
had
clean
hands
with
respect
to
the
terrorist
campaign
against
the
civil
rights
movement
and
how
many
of
them
were
shunned
by
their
peers
In
this
context
to
try
to
make
Obama's
failure
to
play
holier-than-thou
with
respect
to
Ayers
into
a
character
issue
about
Obama
is
really
a
long
stretch

The
Babe
Ruth
Principle
and
Palin's
make-up
artist
by
Mark
Kleiman
Category
Campaign
2008
In
1929
Babe
Ruth
batted
345
with
46
homers
and
158
RBI's
As
a
result
his
contract
for
1930
called
for
him
to
be
paid
an
unheard-of
80,000
which
was
more
than
the
75,000
salary
of
the
President
of
the
United
States
When
someone
asked
the
Bambino
whether
he
was
embarrassed
to
be
paid
more
than
Hoover
Ruth
a
Democrat
is
supposed
to
have
replied
But
I
had
a
better
year
than
him
Call
that
the
Babe
Ruth
Principle
that
someone
should
be
paid
according
to
his
or
her
performance
not
merely
the
prestige
of
the
job
itself
A
great
right
fielder
deserves
to
earn
more
than
a
lousy
President
It
seems
to
me
that
the
Babe
Ruth
Principle
has
contemporary
application
Consider
for
example
the
pseudo-fuss
being
kicked
up
because
Sarah
Palin's
makeup
artist
was
paid
22,000
for
just
the
first
two
weeks
of
October
far
more
than
any
of
McCain's
speechwriters
or

Comparing

the

The

You
have
to
feel
sorry
for
Ashley
Todd
No
one
without
serious
serious
issues
would
do
what
she
did
But
it's
hard
not
to
laugh
at
her
reported
comment
after
she
had
fessed
up
She
was
upset
with
the
media
for
blowing
this
into
a
political
firestorm
Gee
I
wonder
who
told
her
that
the
media
and
Scary
Black
Men
are
the
national
enemy
Update
Greg
Sargent
at
TPM
fingers
Peter
Feldman
the
communications
director
for
the
McCain
campaign
in
Pennsylvania
as
having
pushed
the
B
for
Barack
story
Apparently
the
Scaife
TV
station
has
pushed
the
relevant
grafs
down
the
memory
hole
but
Sargent
has
the
screenshot
A

asks
When
will
John

repudiate
Peter
Feldman
Good
question

Those
fake-name
contributions
to
Obama
yes
they're
crimes
by
Mark
Kleiman
Category
Watching
Conservatives
In
response
to
my
query
about
whether
the
wingnuts
submitting
Mickey
Mouse
contributions
on
the
Obama
website
are
committing
wire
fraud
a
lawyer-reader
writes
You
are
likely
correct
that
the
wingnuts
could
be
charged
under
the
wire
fraud
statute
Much
more
directly
however
such
wignuts
are
violating
the
Federal
Election
Campaign
Act
the
statute
amended
by
McCain-Feingold
2
U.S.C
441f
provides
in
relevant
part
that
No
person
shall
make
a
contribution
in
the
name
of
another
person
This
provision
carries
criminal
penalties
I'm
pretty
sure
Osama
Bin
Laden
and
William
Ayers
each
qualify
as
the
name
of
another
person
Someone
needs
to
file
a
complaint
with
the
FEC

Hoax

Campaign
2008
Update
Reportedly
the
victim
in
the
Pittsburgh
mugging/political
hate
crime
has
has
confessed
to
confabulating
the
whole
thing
The
story
of
the
McCain
volunteer
who
had
a
B
branded
on
her
face
by
a
knife-wielding
mugger
as
a
political
hate
crime
is
falling
apart
The
video
cameras
at
the
ATM
she
says
she
withdrew
the
money
from
don't
show
her
picture
Her
initial
report
to
the
police
didn't
mention
the
McCain
bumper
sticker
she
later
said
triggered
the
mugger's
anger
She
says
the
mugger
sat
on
her
chest
which
makes
the
fact
that
the
B
faces
the
wrong
way
harder
to
understand
She
also
says
that
she
was
knocked
out
and
doesn't
remember
having
the
B
imprinted
on
her
face
Full
text
of
the
AP
story
at
the
jump
I'm
waiting
retractions
and
apologies
from
the
wingnuts
who
tried
to
use
this
to
revive
the
McCain
campaign
But
I'm
not
going
to
hold
my
breath
And
of
course
waiting
for
Glenn
Reynolds
to
admit
that
his
latest
attack
on
the
non-wingnut
media
fell
flat
is
entirely
pointless
Kudos
to
Michelle
Malkin
And
boy
you're
going
to
have
to
wait
a
long
time
to
hear
me
say
that
again
Update
John
Moody
Executive
Vice
President
of
Fox
News
If
the
incident
turns
out
to
be
a
hoax
Senator
McCain?s
quest
for
the
presidency
is
over
forever
linked
to
race-baiting
If
only
Yes
the
McCain
camp
shamelessly
pushed
this
story
In
addition
to
all
the
behind-the-scenes
spinning
the
campaign
spokeswoman
Jill
Hazelbacker
put
out
word
that
both
McCain
and
Palin
had
called
teh
pseudo-victim
thus
implicitly
endorsing
her
claims
Calling
her
to
express
sympathy
would
have
been
a
good
thing
to
do
without
prejudice
to
the
question
of
her
veracity
publicizing
those
calls
helped
and
was
intended
to
help
spread
what
had
all
he
marks
of
a
false
story
That
campaign
deserves
to
be
over
But
we
still
have
to
suffer
through
eleven
more
days
And
I
doubt
that
the
tone
of
Fox
News
coverage
will
change
But
go
ahead
Mr
Moody
Suprise
me
