Bloggers
around
the
country
will
participate
in
Write

Marry
Day
on
October
29
2008
posting
on
their
blogs
in
support
of
marriage
equality
for
same-sex
couples
and
against
California's
Proposition
8
Prop
8
is
a
measure
on
California's
November
ballot
that
would
take
away
the
right
of
same-sex
couples
to
marry
The
event
will
give
bloggers
a
chance
to
voice
their
opposition
to
Prop
8
and
highlight
what
they
may
have
already
done
online
or
off
to
stop
the
measure
The
campaign
will
also
educate
California
voters
of
the
need
to
go
all
the
way
down
the
ballot
to
vote
on
the
proposition
Bloggers

proven
themselves

one

organizers
who

the
popular

and
is
Director
of
the

Initiative
They
have
already
helped
raise
awareness
and
money
to
stop
Prop
8
In
this
last
week
before
the
election
they
will
play
a
crucial
role
in
motivating
others
to
take
action
Prop
8
is
an
unfair
and
unnecessary
measure
that
would
eliminate
equal
protections
for
same-sex
couples
and
write
discrimination
into
the
California
state
Constitution

equality

claims
that

Whispers
about
Senate
Minority
Leader
Mitch
McConnell's
R-KY
military
service
during
the
Vietnam
War
have
been
floating
around
Washington
for
years
and
were
reported
in
print
at
least
as
far
back
as
two
campaigns
ago
From
the
Kentucky
Kernel
of
November
1
1996
Senator's
Discharged
Questioned
A
letter
found
in
the
University
of
Kentucky
Library
Department
of
Special
Collections
of
a
request
from
a
former
U.S
Senator
to
the
then
commanding
general
of
Fort
Knox
created
conflicting
stories
Thursday
about
the
military
record
of
Republican
U
S
Sen
Mitch
McConnell
The
letter
was
found
in
the
personal
letters
of
U.S
Sen
John
Sherman
Cooper
a
Republican
from
Kentucky
It
was
written
to
Maj
Gen
A
D
Surles
commanding
general
of
Fort
Knox
McConnell
served
as
an
intern
in
Cooper's
Washington
D.C
office
in
summer
of
1964
He
was
in
boot
camp
at
Ft
Knox
and
a
member
of
the
100th
Division
of
the
U.S
Army
Reserve.McConnell
enlisted
in
March
of
1967
and
was
abruptly
discharged
four
months
later
for
a
minor
medical
condition
optic
neurosis
During
a
time
of
war
one
might
appropriately
presume
the
armed
forces
would
want
to
minimize
the
number
of
departing
soldiers
Again
from
the
Kernel
Dr
Mike
Minix
with
the
department
of
ophthalmology
at
the
UK
Med
Center
explained
that
optic
neuritis
usually
affects
individuals
15-45
years
of
age
According
to
Minix
the
condition
can
usually
be
treated
with
steroids
Within
three-four
weeks
of
having
the
condition
individuals
will
usually
have
their
eyesight
return
to
20-20
vision
or
normal
vision
This
same
type
of
treatment
would
have
been
prescribed
in
1967
although
advancements
have
been
made
in
the
treatment
of
this
eye
condition
he
said
McConnell's
discharge
was
expedited
by
Cooper's
claim
that
the
enlistee
needed
to
be
released
quickly
to
attend
New
York
University
NYU
records
however
indicate
that
McConnell
never
applied
to
the
school
and
at
the
time
of
his
discharge
he
had
already
earned
a
law
degree
from
the
University
of
Kentucky
Why
exactly
would
a
United
States
Senator
write
to
the
Commanding
General
of
one
of
the
nation's
most
important
military
instillations
with
false
information
about
a
member
of
the
US
armed
forces
Click
to
enlarge
A
lot
of
smart
people
have
pursued
this
story
The
common
thread
McConnell's
military
records
That's
because
those
records
are
private
unless
of
course
McConnell
chooses
to
make
them
public
Sen
McConnell
doesn't
even
acknowledge
his
military
service
on
either
his
US
Senate
or
re-election
campaign
websites
so
it's
probably
no
surprise
that
he's
kept
those
records
under
lock
and
key
for
years
So
why
revisit
this
story
and
why
revisit
it
now
Like
when
I
investigated
and
reported
on
Larry
Craig
after
26
years
of
rumors
I've
turned
fresh
eyes
on
this
case
and
recently
noticed
an
interesting
inconsistency
with
McConnell's
public
Army
record
In
particular
there
is
a
differing
answer
to
a
section
of
his
records
titled
Transcript
of
Court
Martial
While
every
other
section
of
McConnell's
records
without
information
simply
n/a
this
particular
section
uniquely
states
not
on
file
Does
that
mean
a
McConnell
court
martial
file
exists
Only
the
Senator
knows
I
also
have
reviewed
copies
of
phone
records
showing
a
flurry
of
calls
from
the
office
of
McConnell's
patron
in
the
Senate
Sen
Cooper
in
the
days
immediately
preceding
McConnell's
discharge
The
calls
abruptly
stopped
as
McConnell
was
released
from
the
service
It
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
the
UK
archives
show
that
despite
a
frequent
correspondence
during
the
years
prior
to
his
discharge
it
was
three
years
after
McConnell's
discharge
before
they
exchanged
letters
again
Is
there
a
smoking
gun
on
any
story
about
McConnell
While
for
a
host
of
reasons
it's
not
possible
to
talk
about
the
documents
I
possess
there
certainly
are
enough
serious
and
legitimate
questions
about
his
military
service
that
deserve
answers
not
just
to
me
but
to
every
citizen
of
Kentucky
I've
taken
six
trips
to
the
state
in
the
last
several
months
to
investigate
these
questions
I've
visited
a
slew
of
towns
spoken
with
dozens
of
people
and
spent
hours
poring
over
archived
public
records
Under
what
appears
more
and
more
likely
under
an
Obama
administration
McConnell
the
Senate
Minority
Leader
is
poised
to
become
the
highest-ranking
Republican
in
the
country
He
deserves
the
same
level
of
scrutiny
as
other
top
elected
officials
The
apparent
standard
bearer
of
his
party
this
anti-gay
politician
sets
policies
and
national
priorities
that
have
a
far-reaching
impact
on
us
all
The
American
people
deserve
to
know
the
truth
about
this
man
and
what
these
records
indicate
from
his
past
They
say
experience
shapes
your
perspective
on
things
Could
such
experiences
explain
McConnell's
uneven
treatment
of
the
sex
scandals
of
Republican
Senators
Larry
Craig
and
David
Vitter
received
a
great
deal
of
attention
last
year
McConnell
was
quick
to
throw
Larry
Craig
under
the
bus
yet
threw
his
support
behind
adulterer
and
prostitute
client
David
Vitter
Even
the
Kentucky
MSM
is
covering
the
asking
of
these
questions
McConell's
military
record
attacked
Elections
should
be
about
informed
choices
He's
obviously
not
proud
of
his
record
Sen
McConnell
isn't
or
he
would
have
shown
it
by
now
Stumbo
said
Something
isn't
correct
about
it
that
might
cause
a
lot
of
people
including
veterans
to
take
a
second
look
at
him
McConnell
enlisted
in
the
Army
Reserve
in
July
1967
at
the
height
of
the
Vietnam
War
but
received
a
medical
discharge
after
less
than
six
months
for
an
eye
condition
called
optic
neuritis
according
to
limited
information
that
has
been
made
public.No
matter
how
you
slice
it
McConnell's
story
just
doesn't
add
up
That's
why
I've
encouraged
him
to
consider
the
facts
and
truth
his
allies
not
a
problem
He
should
come
clean
with
the
American
people
A
speedy
release
of
his
records
and
openness
with
the
public
is
the
only
thing
that
will
help
clear
this
matter
up
once
and
for
all

A

I
happen
to
live
down
the
street

one

I

phrases
My
friends
to

I
haven't
felt
such
pity
for
anyone
since
the
late
Adm
James
Stockdale
humiliated
himself
as
Ross
Perot's
running
mate
And
I
am
sorry
to
have
to
say
it
but
Stockdale
had
also
distinguished
himself
in
America's
most
disastrous
and
shameful
war
and
it
didn't
qualify
him
then
and
it
doesn't
qualify
McCain
now
With
McCain
the

Virgil
Goode's
district
newspaper
moved
the
story
Goode
linked
to
movie
about
homosexuality
In
2003
the
same
year
Eden's
Curve
was
produced
Goode
earmarked
150,000
in
federal
taxpayer
funds
to
Danville's
North
Theatre
The
Danville
Register
Bee
at
the
time
questioned
Goode's
perceived
favoritism
with
these
projects
because
Duncan
and
Goode's
wife
Lucy
are
both
on
the
board
of
the
North
Theatre
In
2003
Duncan
told
the
Register
Bee
he
didn't
see
any
conflict
with
the
earmarked
dollars
I
don't
even
know
how
a
question
of
a
conflict
even
arises

When

is

Virgil

Anti-gay
Congressman
How
does
Virgil
Goode
R-VA
square
his
condemnation
of
gay
and
lesbian
Americans
while
helping
to
make
Eden's
Curve
asks
Mike
Stark
as
part
of
this
story
of
anti-gay
hypocrisy
and
that
good
old
Washington
power
tool
money
Welcome
to
a
special
BlogActive
Investigation
by
Mike
Stark
of
Accountability
Moments
If
nothing
else
Virgil
Goode
is
consistent
Since
the
107th
Congress
that's
back
to
2001
he
has
scored
a
zero
every
year
on
the
Human
Rights
Campaign
Legislative
scorecard
You
almost
have
to
TRY
to
do
that
So
how
does
an
anti-gay
Republican
US
Congressman
come
to
support
a
movie
that
is
filled
with
lots
of
gay
sex
and
lots
of
drug
use
Well
the
best
place
to
start
is
with
Linwood
Duncan
Goode's
Press
Secretary
Linwood
is
gay
an
open
secret
in
DC
and
has
aspirations
to
be
a
movie
star
In
2003
Ed
Henry
then
with
Roll
Call
reported
about
Linwood
and
his
dreams
of
the
silver
screen
Who
knew
that
Linwood
Duncan
the
unassuming
press
secretary
for
Rep
Virgil
Goode
R-Va
has
been
dabbling
in
acting
on
the
side
and
turns
up
with
a
bit
part
in
the
new
movie
Eden's
Curve
Duncan
has
played
everyone
from
Sherlock
Holmes
to
Sir
Thomas
More
in
dozens
of
shows
in
the
D.C
and
Charlottesville
Va
areas
He
was
approached
by
a
longtime
friend
Jerry
Meadors
screenwriter
and
producer
for
Eden's
Curve
You're
thinking
what's
the
big
deal
Who
cares
if
Roll
Call
wrote
about
a
movie
starring
a
right-wing
Congressional
staffer
that
was
especially
popular
at
gay
and
lesbian
film
festivals
across
the
country
because
the
lead
character
gets
mixed
up
in
relationships
with
his
male
roommate
I'll
tell
you
who
cares
The
anti-earmark
conservatives
care
and
the
anti-gay
troglodytes
care
A
LOT
You
read
it
here
first
After
his
press
secretary
got
his
first
film
acting
break
in
a
movie
filled
with
gay
sex
and
drug
use
the
conservative
Republican
Congressman
moved
an
earmark
for
150,000
to
the
very
theater
run
by
the
movie's
producer
And

Can

150,000
earmark
was

Monday
whether
he
had
carried
on
an

with

quiet
then
called
