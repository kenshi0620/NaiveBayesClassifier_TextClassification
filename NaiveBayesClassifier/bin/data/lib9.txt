under

ever
wonder
why
in
the
bible
they
dont
make
exclusions
to
that
rule
you
ever
wonder
why
they
dont
have
a

about
Jesus
denying

the

church
needs
some
serious
self

of

One
Mother's
Stand
by
McCabe
3:24:00
PM
The
president
says
he
feels
compassion
for
me
but
the
best
way
to
show
that
compassion
is
by
meeting
with
me
and
the
other
mothers
and
families
who
are
here
Our
sons
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
and
we
want
answers
All
we're
asking
is
that
he
sacrifice
an
hour
out
of
his
five-week
vacation
to
talk
to
us
before
the
next
mother
loses
her
son

do

want
more
by

12:52:00
AM
its
been
almost
two
months
since
i
last
posted
sad
i
know
but
heres
the
thing
do
you
want
more
general
hair
tearing
out
frustration
has
in
part
kept
me
from
posting
and
on
the
converse
to
an
extent
kept
me
from
reading
the
news
because
every
time
i
read
the
news
i
want
to
tear
my
hair
out
more
and
then
since
i
stopped
posting
for
a
while
it
became
kinda
awkward
the
blog
became
sort
of
that
friend
you
stopped
talking
to
for
no
good
reason
and
with
every
passing
second
it
just
got
more
awkward
to
start
up
a
conversation
well
anywho
im
back
you
can
shoot
me
but
i
wont
die

Court
to
Decide
if
Colleges
Can
Bar
Military
Recruiters
by
McCabe
6:55:00
PM
well
this
will
be
quite
interesting
im
not
sure
exactly
where
i
stand
right
now
because
i
can
easily
see
both
sides
of
the
argument
government
wants
quid
pro
quo
universities
dont
want
to
have
their
students
killed
is
the
military
the
government
thats
basically
what
it
comes
down
to
how
do
we
view
the
government
of
america
or
rather
how
do
the
supreme
court
justices
as
a
prop
of
the
military
whos
main
purpose
is
recruiting
and
enlisting
men
and
women
to
carry
guns/whatever
they
want
them
to
do
or
is
the
government
an
enterprise
to
better
the
lives
of
americans
and
has
as
one
of
its
entities
a
group
capable
of
military
action
where
does
the
military
fit
into
the
american
psyche
if
at
all
feel
free
to
respond

when
i
read
stories
like
this
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
my
mind
and
my
mouth
for
that
matter
is
ass
holes
those
effing
ass
holes
the
men
who
died
the
effing
boys
who
died
one
was
freaking
19
years
old
less
than
1
year
older
than
me
the
boys
who
died
did
not
deserve
to
die
for
your
bull
shit
illegitimate
mistake
of
a
war
and
to
effing
boot
you
cant
even
provide
the
foot
soldiers
that
are
waging
a
war
for
your
precious
black
gold
with
even
decent
armour
if
you
assholes
didnt
have
your
head
so
far
up
your
oil-heavy
broker's
ass
you
would
see
the
lives
you
tear
apart
every
day
with
your
crusade
for
effing
glorious
wealth
george

i
hate
you
i
will
not

until
you
