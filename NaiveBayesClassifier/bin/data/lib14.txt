Bill

Describes
VRWC
in
NY
Times
Piece
Today
Sounding
like
a
Seeing
the
Forest
regular
in
A
Party
Inverted
former
Senator
Bill
Bradley
today
describes
how
the
Right
has
built
a
network
of
organizations
that
have
become
the
foundation
for
the
Republican
Party
and
how
this
structure
supports
their
candidates
outside
of
the
election
cycle
This
is
a
must-read
To
further
the
party's
ideological
and
political
goals
Republicans
in
the
1970's
and
1980's
built
a
comprehensive
structure
based
on
Powell's
blueprint
Visualize
that
structure
as
a
pyramid
You've
probably
heard
some
of
this
before
but
let
me
run
through
it
again
Big
individual
donors
and
large
foundations
the
Scaife
family
and
Olin
foundations
for
instance
form
the
base
of
the
pyramid
They
finance
conservative
research
centers
like
the
Heritage
Foundation
the
Cato
Institute
and
the
Intercollegiate
Studies
Institute
entities
that
make
up
the
second
level
of
the
pyramid
The
ideas
these
organizations
develop
are
then
pushed
up
to
the
third
level
of
the
pyramid
the
political
level
There
strategists
like
Karl
Rove
or
Ralph
Reed
or
Ken
Mehlman
take
these
new
ideas
and
through
polling
focus
groups
and
careful
attention
to
Democratic
attacks
convert
them
into
language
that
will
appeal
to
the
broadest
electorate
That
language
is
sometimes
in
the
form
of
an
assault
on
Democrats
and
at
other
times
in
the
form
of
advocacy
for
a
new
policy
position
The
development
process
can
take
years
And
then
there's
the
fourth
level
of
the
pyramid
the
partisan
news
media
Conservative
commentators
and
networks
spread
these
finely
honed
ideas.He
describes
how
this
structure
supports
candidates
The
Republicans
have
this
massive
structure
in
place
so
it
doesn't
really
matter
who
they
run
As
I
have
said
here
just
look
at
who
they
run
and
tell
me
they
are
better
candidates
At
the
very
top
of
the
pyramid
you'll
find
the
president
Because
the
pyramid
is
stable
all
you
have
to
do
is
put
a
different
top
on
it
and
it
works
fine
It
is
not
quite
the
right
wing
conspiracy
that
Hillary
Clinton
described
but
it
is
an
impressive
organization
built
consciously
carefully
and
single-mindedly
The
Ann
Coulters
and
Grover
Norquists
don't
want
to
be
candidates
for
anything
or
cabinet
officers
for
anyone
They
know
their
roles
and
execute
them
because
they're
paid
well
and
believe
I
think
in
what
they're
saying
True
there's
lots
of
money
involved
but
the
money
makes
a
difference
because
it
goes
toward
reinforcing
a
structure
that
is
already
stable
To
understand
how
the
Democratic
Party
works
invert
the
pyramid
Imagine
a
pyramid
balancing
precariously
on
its
point
which
is
the
presidential
candidate
Democrats
who
run
for
president
have
to
build
their
own
pyramids
all
by
themselves
There
is
no
coherent
larger
structure
that
they
can
rely
on
Unlike
Republicans
they
don't
simply
have
to
assemble
a
campaign
apparatus
they
have
to
formulate
ideas
and
a
vision
too
Many
Democratic
fundraisers
join
a
campaign
only
after
assessing
how
well
it
has
done
in
assembling
its
pyramid
of
political
media
and
idea
people
There
is
no
clearly
identifiable
funding
base
for
Democratic
policy
organizations
and
in
the
frantic
campaign
rush
there
is
no
time
for
patient
long-term
development
of
new
ideas
or
of
new
ways
to
sell
old
ideas
Campaigns
don't
start
thinking
about
a
Democratic
brand
until
halfway
through
the
election
year
by
which
time
winning
the
daily
news
cycle
takes
precedence
over
building
a
consistent
message
The
closest
that
Democrats
get
to
a
brand
is
a
catchy
slogan.This
understanding
of
how
much
the
Right
is
doing
outside
of
the
election
cycle
that
directly
affects
elections
is
so
important
to
get
From
Win
or
Lose
The
Right's
machine
is
not
oriented
around
the
election
cycle
it
is
constant
yet
this
is
why
they
win
elections
Their
organizations
provide
a
drumbeat
of
propaganda
all
year
every
year
working
with
the
latest
PR
and
marketing
techniques
utilizing
the
latest
research
into
the
psychology
of
persuasion
exploiting
the
latest
trends
etc
Because
its
marketing
is
constant
their
politicians
have
it
easy
they
just
show
up
and
echo
the
ideology
that
this
machine
has
been
pumping
out
and
ride
along
on
the
rest
of
the
resulting
public
opinion
Their
politicians
are
almost
interchangable
their
work
having
been
already
done
for
them
by
the
organizations
they
have
only
to
show
up
and
say
the
right
things
and
they
have
an
automatic
base
of
support
Moderate
and
Progressive
politicians
on
the
other
hand
have
to
develop
their
positions
each
election
cycle
largely
on
their
own
and
communicate
their
ideas
themselves
Everyone
blames
the
Democratic
Party
for
lack
of
vision
lack
of
marketing
etc
when
the
problem
really
is
that
there
is
not
a
comparable
network
of
moderate
and
progressive
ADVOCACY
MARKETING
AND
COMMUNICATIONS
organizations
that
are
OUTSIDE
of
the
party
apparatus
supporting
it
feeding
it
ideas
foot
soldiers
and
voters
Organizations
on
the
Right
like
the
Heritage
Foundation
provide
talking
points
training
media
skills
and
most
important
farm
teams
EMPLOYMENT
for
thousands
of
foot
soldiers
for
the
Right
Almost
everyone
on
the
Right
is
paid
and
paid
well
which
serves
to
buy
their
loyalty
to
the
core
group
of
funders
their
ideology
and
their
goals
They
follow
a
long-term
approach
which
is
why
recruiting
lots
of
young
people
and
finding
them
paid
positions
as
foot
soldiers
is
an
important
part
of
their
operation
Eventually
these
people
will
become
activists
candidates
etc
And
by
having
an
employed
stable
of
professional
pundits
speakers
activists
etc
they
are
able
to
bring
their
wurlitzer
to
bear
on
any
issue
at
any
time
as
necessary
So
the
question
here
is
why
doesn't
our
side
have
a
similar
infrastructure
in
place
I've
spent
a
lot
of
time
studying
this
problem
and
have
developed
some
theories
And
I
have
some
ideas
about
how
to
begin
to
counter
what
the
Right
is
doing.Now
go
here
and
give
them
some
money
so
they
can
fight
the
Right
here
to
study
up
on
what
has
been
happening
to
us
and
here
to
read
up
on
Progressive
Infrastructure
to
give
our
side
a
voice

Blog
Change
Coming
Friday
On
Friday
Seeing
the
Forest
is
going
to
switch
over
to
its
new
site
That
site
will
be
at
Seeingtheforest.com
The
blog
you
are
reading
now
is
located
at
seetheforest.blogspot.com
and
I
currently
have
a
redirect
set
up
for
Seeingtheforest.com
that
sends
everyone
here
On
Friday
we
leave
Blogger
and
blogspot
and
all
the
problems
behind
for
good
I
will
change
the
name
servers
for
SeeingtheForest.com
to
point
to
the
new
blog
Many
of
you
won't
have
to
do
anything
because
you'll
just
be
sent
to
the
new
location
automatically
But
people
who
have
bookmarks
set
to
seetheforest.blogspot.com
will
continue
to
come
to
this
site
I
suspect
that
most
blogs
that
link
to
Seeing
the
Forest
are
linking
to
that
incorrect
address
So
if
you
find
yourself
wondering
why
Seeing
the
Forest
is
not
being
updated
it
is
because
you
are
looking
at
the
old
blogspot
site
missing
out
on
all
the
fun
I
know
that
some
of
you
fear
change
and
a
few
of
you
can
be
very
excitable
so
I
have
worked
hard
to
make
sure
the
new
blog
looks
just
like
the
current
one
Yes
I
messed
up
a
perfectly
good
template
to
do
that
Over
time
I
promise
to
make
it
look
better
But
I
just
had
to
get
away
from
blogger
before
anything
else
And
I
know
that
many
of
you
depend
on
Seeing
the
Forest
for
your
very
life
essence
Yes
I
recognize
and
respect
and
shoulder
the
tremendous
responsibility
that
you
have
entrusted
me
with
With
which
you
have
entrusted
me
So
I
will
make
sure
that
there
are
posts
here
on
Thursday
and
posts
there
on
Friday
and
continuity
of
the
flow
will
be
assured
AND
I
will
make
sure
that
anyone
who
comes
here
to
the
blogger
location
will
be
able
to
get
to
the
new
location
On
top
of
that
I
have
made
sure
that
all
the
links
and
archives
at
the
new
location
are
correct
So
you
can
find
old
Seeing
the
Forest
posts
to
read
on
slower
days
and
relive
better
times

I'll
switch

Not

If

Insulting
Bloggers
The
National
Press
Club
Welcomes
Jeff
Gannon
You've
heard
of
Jeff
Gannon
He's
the
right-wing
male
prostitute
that
the
White
House
was
using
as
a
shill
to
deflect
critical
press
questions
Well
now
the
National
Press
club
is
including
him
on
a
panel
1st
paragraph
only
as
a
BLOGGER
And
of
course
they
aren't
putting
any
actual
bloggers
on
the
panel
Yes
the
same
day
that
the
prestigious
Washington
D.C
journalism
organization
plans
to
present
a
lunch
talk
by
former
Washington
Post
executive
editor
Ben
Bradlee
it
will
also
allow
the
former
White
House
reporter/sex
site
operator
to
be
on
a
panel
discussing
bloggers
and
online
journalism
Gannon
whose
real
name
is
James
Guckert
resigned
his
job
with
the
conservative
Talon
News
last
month
after
it
was
revealed
he
had
used
a
pseudonym
had
little
journalism
background
and
had
ties
to
male
escort
Web
sites.Responging
to
this
The
Agonist
has
organized
An
Open
Letter
To
The
National
Press
Club
Members
of
The
National
Press
Club
We
the
undersigned
bloggers
are
very
concerned
about
how
liberal
political
bloggers
are
being
systematically
under-represented
and
belittled
in
the
mainstream
media
academic
settings
and
media
forums
By
being
intentionally
excluded
away
from
these
venues
we
are
effectively
pushed
out
of
the
discourse
of
opinion-leaders
The
result
is
that
the
conventional
wisdom
about
blogging
politics
and
journalism
as
it
concerns
liberal
blogs
becomes
a
feedback
loop
framed
by
the
Conservatives
and
their
media
allies
Indeed
just
a
few
weeks
ago
The
Brookings
Institution
hosted
a
panel
that
originally
included
no
liberal
political
bloggers
and
yet
while
including
numerous
conservative
political
operatives
in
the
event
We
registered
our
protest
and
the
Brookings
Institution's
response
was
simply
to
invite
a
few
liberal
political
bloggers
to
attend
yet
not
sit
on
the
panel
as
we
had
originally
insisted
upon
Today
however
we
are
faced
with
an
entirely
new
situation
that
is
more
insult
than
misrepresentation
The
discredited
conservative
media
operative
Jeff
Gannon
nee
Guckert
has
been
invited
to
sit
on
a
panel
at
the
prestigious
National
Press
Club
to
talk
about
the
scandal
surrounding
his
access
to
the
White
House
and
more
generally
the
similarities
and
differences
between
bloggers
and
journalists
Guckert's
token
liberal
counterpart
will
be
a
gossip
blogger
and
sex
comedy
blogger
While
we
have
nothing
but
the
greatest
respect
for
Mr
Graff
and
Ms
Cox
we
believe
that
neither
represents
bloggers
who
write
about
hard-nosed
politics
And
as
for
Mr
Guckert
he
isn't
a
blogger
he's
barely
a
journalist
and
not
a
single
political
blogger
involved
with
the
Gannon/Guckert
scandal
or
otherwise
has
been
invited
to
sit
on
the
panel
to
counter
Mr
Guckert's
arguments
Therefore
we
the
undersigned
bloggers
respectfully
but
firmly
insist
that
a
serious
political
blogger
such
as
John
Aravosis
of
Americablog.org
be
included
on
the
panel
to
fairly
and
accurately
represent
our
industry
and
us
Mr
Aravosis
has
agreed
to
our
request
that
he
serve
on
the
panel
as
our
representative
and
is
available
should
such
an
invite
be
forthcoming
This
situation
is
simply
unacceptable
We
will
push
back
against
the
growing
bias
and
sloppiness
we
see
in
the
mainstream
media
as
it
concerns
serious
political
blogging
If
we
do
not
we
will
never
achieve
any
semblance
of
balance
in
the
media
If
we
do
not
we
abdicate
our
ability
to
tell
our
own
side
of
the
story
If
we
do
not
we
leave
it
to
others
to
define
us
and
defame
us
Please
call
Julie
Shue
at
the
The
National
Press
Club
and
politely
insist
that
they
include
John
Aravosis
of
Americablog.org
at
their
event
Here
are
there

Moderates
Academics
and
Democrats
Recently
on
Kos
and
MYDD
there's
been
a
discussion
of
the
left
blogosphere
which
traces
back
to
an
old
post
by
Kevin
Drum
The
gist
of
the
discussion
is
here
If
you
remove
Atrios
the
left
blogosphere
is
neatly
divided
into
two
mutually-linking
spheres
the
moderate/intellectual
academicky
types
Drum
DeLong
Yglesias
TPM
Tapped
Crooked
Timber
and
the
left
activist
types
Kos
MyDD
Digby
Left
Coaster
Pandagon
only
this
one
surprised
me
a
bit
Even
at
the
modest
5-link
level
none
of
these
blogs
link
to
anyone
on
other
side.Here
are
a
few
points
I'd
like
to
add
to
the
discussion
The
moderation
of
the
journalists
TAPPED
Marshall
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
career
path
for
committed
aggressive
liberal
Democrats
is
pretty
puny
What
you
see
on
TV
on
the
talk
shows
and
on
most
of
the
newspapers
is
almost
entirely
conservative
Republicans
centrists
of
both
parties
and
apolitical
professionals
Beyond
ideology
ambitious
journalists
can't
afford
to
offend
important
people
in
the
biz
even
if
they
are
egregiously
dishonest
and
from
time
to
time
all
of
them
make
a
point
of
saying
nice
things
about
whoever
they
think
is
the
least
loathesome
guy
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
Bob
Somerby
is
the
person
they
don't
dare
to
be
Recently
he
applauded
a
statement
of
Josh
Marshall's
about
the
dismal
state
of
reporting
on
this
issue
or
that
but
pointed
out
that
Marshall
had
failed
to
name
any
names
Somerby
is
almost
always
right
but
he
names
names
and
has
made
too
many
enemies
The
people
at
TAPPED
have
slammed
Somerby
whenever
they've
gotten
the
chance
and
lo
Nick
Confessore
just
got
hired
by
the
New
York
Times
I
think
that
the
collegiality
of
academia
combined
with
excessive
doses
of
Orwell
and
Gandhi
tend
to
incapacitate
academics
for
the
kind
of
gutter
fighting
you
need
when
you're
facing
Rush
Limbaugh
Karl
Rove
and
Grover
Norquist
I
think
that
the
habits
and
ways
characteristic
of
academic
institutions
are
the
problem
and
I
think
that
many
of
these
habits
and
ways
are
also
characteristic
of
the
various
other
kinds
of
large
institutions
where
Democrats
tend
to
make
their
careers
The
Republicans
hire
semi-criminal
entrepreneurs
and
it
works
for
them
Finally
Ivy-League
whiz
kids
bring
a
lot
to
the
party
but
I
think
that
they're
too
influential
They
tend
to
have
a
pretty
limited
class
experience
and
even
the
ones
who
come
from
non-elite
backgrounds
can
be
careerists
intent
on
escaping
from
their
past
To
put
it
simply
I
think
that
the
Democrats
should
hire
more
people
from
SW
Texas
State
and
fewer
from
Harvard
Before
I
get
accused
of
being
a
know-nothing
Maoist-Populist
wrecker
I
don't
think
that
anyone
should
be
purged
because
of
their
background
But
I
do
think
that
there's
been
a
skew
in
the
Democratic
Party
which
should
be
corrected
The
Democrats
populist
roots
are
still
featured
at
Roosevelt-Kennedy
nostalgia
fests
but
are
not
very
evident
in
the
party's
real-time
activities
Republican
populism
is
fake
but
it
works
And
finally
as
always
I
think
that
the
big
fact
of
today's
political
world
is
that
there
are
no
good
guys
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
and
that
Democrats
should
quit
looking
for
them
Temporarily

of
retirement

Government
DID
Help
Saudis
Leave
After
9/11
New
Details
on
F.B.I
Aid
for
Saudis
After
9/11
The
episode
has
been
retold
so
many
times
in
the
last
three
and
a
half
years
that
it
has
become
the
stuff
of
political
legend
in
the
frenzied
days
after
Sept
11
2001
when
some
flights
were
still
grounded
dozens
of
well-connected
Saudis
including
relatives
of
Osama
bin
Laden
managed
to
leave
the
United
States
on
specially
chartered
flights
Now
newly
released
government
records
show
previously
undisclosed
flights
from
Las
Vegas
and
elsewhere
and
point
to
a
more
active
role
by
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
in
aiding
some
of
the
Saudis
in
their
departure
The
F.B.I
gave
personal
airport
escorts
to
two
prominent
Saudi
families
who
fled
the
United
States
and
several
other
Saudis
were
allowed
to
leave
the
country
without
first
being
interviewed
the
documents
show.The
key
for
me
line
in
Michael
Moore's
Fahrenheit
911
movie
was
Imagine
how
the
press
and
conservatives
would
react
if
after
the
Oklahoma
City
bombing
we
learned
that
Bill

had
helped
get
Timothy

by
Norman
Spinrad
author
of
among
others
the
classic
SF
novels
Bug
Jack
Barron
and
The
Iron

In
it
he
details
the
sorry
state
of
science
fiction
publishing
one
look
at
the
lousy
design
of
the
IASFM
web
site
is
worth
a
thousand
words
on
the
economic
state
of
the
industry
not
to
mention
the
lack
of
interior
illustrations
in
recent
issues
and
a
very
sad
and
woleful
tale
it
is
Major
publishers
count
themselves
lucky
to
distribute
15,000
copies
of
a
mass
market
publication
Small
press
publishers
deem
1,000
copies
a
major
success
Major
publishers
seem
to
be
in
the
process
of
dropping
literarily
ambitious
science
fiction
from
their
SF
lines
I
see
the
best
minds
of
my
generation
and
the
ones
that
followed
surrendering
into
small
press
publication
in
order
to
be
published
at
all
or
adapting
their
talents
to
fantasy
or
in
my
case
historical
fiction
to
earn
a
living
to
be
sure
but
also
to
reach
a
readership
of
any
meaningful
size
The
ultimate
result
in
his
view
will
be
the
death
of
science
fiction
as
we
know
it
and
the
loss
of
our
society's
primary
vehicle
for
cultural
transformation
Here's
what
he
has
to
say
on
the
subject
Science
fiction
can
envision
not
just
technology
and
science
beyond
that
presently
existing
in
the
universe
of
the
reader
but
cultures
evolved
beyond
our
own
and
create
a
belief
in
the
reader
that
such
things
are
possible
indeed
must
demonstrate
that
they
cohere
with
the
realm
of
the
possible
in
order
to
do
so
And
if
one
believes
that
something
is
possible
and
it
really
is
one
can
be
moved
to
attempt
to
make
it
so
Thus
science
fiction
is
not
only
a
visionary
literature
that
can
transcend
the
culture
in
which
it
is
created
but
a
transformational
literature
that
can
and
has
from
time
to
time
evolved
those
cultures
onward
An
inherently
revolutionary
literature
in
the
macrocosm
and
the
microcosm
For
while
it
is
said
that
no
consciousness
can
comprehend
a
consciousness
evolved
beyond
its
own
science
fiction
readers
are
gifted
with
that
comprehension
all
the
time
by
writers
who
create
such
fictional
characters
And
by
inhabiting
the
consciousness
of
such
characters
armed
with
the
belief
that
they
exist
in
the
realm
of
the
possible
cannot
readers
aspire
to
attain
the
next
level
A
revolutionary
literature
A
visionary
literature
A
transformational
literature
The
one
and
the
only
If
you
have
no
means
of
imagining
and
communicating
a
vision
of
something
above
and
beyond
the
present
state
you
end
up
with
a
culture
with
no
means
of
even
conceptualizing
it
let
alone
calling
it
into
being
You
can
log
one
more
negative
side
effect
of
corporate
consolidation
and
media
monopolies
the
potential
death
of
our
culture's
ability
to
evolve
and
respond
to
new
challenges

the
fence
he
participated
in

street
protests
during

just
before
he

this
column
There's
a
hint
earlier
on
that
perhaps
some
of
the
small
press
publishers
can
grow
themselves
into
independent
publishers
perhaps
the
answer
to
the
call
to
revolution
he
ends
the
column
with
is
for
us
the
readers
to
set
up
our
own
self-contained
economic
ecology

the

such
as
Chelsea
Green
her
company
grow
even
writing
these
authors
and
getting
no
response
from
any
of
them
Its
a
serious
question
how
addicted
are
we
to
the
corporate
culture
we
inhabit
Can
we
really
envision
an
alternative
One
for
which
we'd
honestly
be
willing
to
put
our
money
where
our
mouth
is
If
folks
as
eminent
as
the
ones
Bruce
mentions
in
his
column
can't
do
so
what
does
it
say
about
the
chances
of
the
rest
of
us

Dear
Progressive
Bloggers
You're
doing
it
again
You're
not
seeing
what
is
really
going
on
You
are
missing
the
bigger
picture
You
are
looking
at
trees
and
missing
the
forest
Do
you
really
after
all
this
time
and
all
these
defeats
think
the
Right
is
stupid
You
mock
the
Republicans
for
blatantly
acting
politically
and
ignore
that
they
ARE
ACTING
POLITICALLY
In
other
words
they're
acting
in
the
way
that
will
in
the
long
term
gain
them
more
support
for
their
candidates
and
issues
You
mock
their
politicians
for
flocking
to
this
because
of
a
Republican
talking
points
memo
telling
them
this
will
gain
them
a
political
advantage
yet
you
do
not
see
that
THIS
WILL
GAIN
THEM
POLITICAL
ADVANTAGE
You're
nitpicking
details
and
ignoring
the
larger
narrative
They
are
trying
to
save
this
poor
woman
They
are
defending
this
poor
woman's
family
Meanwhile
you
are
pointing
out
discrepancies
in
the
finer
details
What
about
her
husband
you
ask
when
they
talk
about
her
parents
She
can't
feel
pain
you
say
when
they
accuse
Democrats
of
starving
her
to
death
How
many
people
hear
that
they
are
trying
to
save
this
poor
woman
Everyone
How
many
people
over
time
will
pay
attention
to
the
nitpicking
details
You
THINK
what
the
Republicans
are
doing
is
unpopular
with
the
public
because
you
see
the
issue
details
in
the
polls
and
think
they
matter
Polls
say
people
wouldn't
want
to
live
if
they
were
in
her
situation
Polls
say
the
state
should
have
precedence
over
the
Feds
But
have
you
seen
polls
that
reflect
the
larger
narrative
that
the
Republican
machine
is
spreading
Do
the
polls
ask
if
Republicans
are
trying
to
save
this
poor
woman's
life
while
Democrats
are
trying
to
kill
her
What
do
you
think
those
polls
would
say
You
point
out
how
hypocritical
the
Republicans
are
being
without
thinking
about
WHY
Stop
arguing
details
getting
all
caught
up
and
pinned
down
Start
arguing
the
larger
narrative
Tune
in
to
Limbaugh
Go
read
the
Right's
press
They
are
escalating
this
Ask
yourself
why
And
watch
your
backs
Update
Never
mind
polls
showing
the
public
thinks
Congress
shouldn't
interfere
feels
they
would
want
to
die
in
the
same
situation
etc
Those
are
narrow
issue
points
WE
ALREADY
KNOW
that
we
win
on
issues
But
they
win
on
the
larger
strategic
narratives
We
know
all
these
things
and
here
we
are
doing
it
all
over
again
We're
arguing
the
details
of
their
lies
instead
of
reaching
the
broader
general
public
with
a
larger
narrative
that
reinforces
public
acceptance
of
the
benefits
of
underlying
Progressive
values

Church
Accused
Of
Political
Activity
The
IRS
is
accusing
a
church
of
violating
its
tax-exempt
status
for
engaging
in
political
activities
Read
the
next
line
only
if
you
are
sitting
down
They
are
making
the
accusation
because
of
an
appearance
by
a
Democratic
candidate
Yes
you
heard
me
right
The
IRS
has
notified
a
Liberty
City
church
that
it
is
under
investigation
for
possibly
engaging
in
political
activity
putting
its
tax-exempt
status
into
question
The
probe
is
related
to
an
appearance
last
October
by
Democratic
presidential
candidate
John
Kerry
and
several
black
leaders
including
U.S
Rep
Kendrick
Meek
of
Miami
the
Rev
Al
Sharpton
and
the
Rev
Jesse
Jackson."The
agencies
of
the
government
are
being
used
to
enforce
a
one-party
state
Churches
and
religious
leaders
publicly
support
the
Republican
Party
with
impunity
Catholic
Bishops
and
Southern
Baptists
tell
their
flocks
it
is
a
sin
to
vote
for
Democrats
but
this
is
allowed
And
just
to
drive
the
point
home
the
government
investigates
a
church
because
it
allowed
a
Democrat
to
speak
The
IRS
is
also
investigating
the
NAACP
for
political
activity
Not
the
Heritage
Foundation
Cato
American
Enterprise
Institute
or
any
of
the
500
other
organizations
in
the
conservative
movement
network
financed
to
the
tune
of
400
million
a
year
that
are
the
core
of
the
Republican
Party
Nope
not
them
Next
it
will
be
jobs
If
you
are
a
Democrat
you
don't
get
hired
don't
get
promoted
etc

Drives
Me
Crazy
See
the
updates
at
the
bottom
of
this
post
I
am
upset
by
the
tone
of
John's
post
below
I
just
got
home
from
a
very
long
day
and
will
get
some
sleep
and
think
about
what
I
want
to
say
about
it
Update
It
was
the
language
directed
at
a
person
that
bothered
me
John
addressed
this
Everything
is
OK
now
Also
I
think
hope
Kevin's
post
might
have
been
misinterpreted
But
misinterpreted
or
not
Kevin
quoted
and
did
not
address
Milbank
mentioning
a
press
that
brought
the
Clinton
scandals
to
light
GOOD
LORD
THERE
WERE
NO
CLINTON
SCANDALS
Just
one
guy
got
a
blow
job
That's
it
After
all
of
the
accusations
and
investigations
investigations
that
distracted
from
real
issues
and
threats
not
a
SINGLE
accusation
turned
out
to
have
any
merit
at
all
and
not
a
SINGLE
member
of
the
administration
was
found
to
have
done
anything
wrong
The
investigations
were
so
thorough
and
the
members
of
the
Clinton
administration
were
so
clean
that
one
guy
was
found
to
have
overbilled
clients
years
earlier
and
was
sent
to
Federal
prison
for
a
long
time
for
it
That's
the
whole
thing
Saying
there
were
Clinton
scandals
is
a
right-wing
talking
point
It
is
part
of
a
strategic
campaign
of
lies
to
discredit
legitimate
government
and
pave
the
way
for
the
right-wing/corporate
takeover
of
the
country
that
we
have
seen
occur
Aside
from
anything
else
in
the
post
Kevin
should
have
picked
that
up
and
called
Milbank
on
that
Milbank
should
have
understood
what
he
was
saying
These
are
the
kinds
of
things
we
should
all
be
aware
of
now
I
can't
address
the
rest
of
what
Kevin
was
saying
because
I'm
not
sure
what
he
was
saying
Kevin
drives
me
crazy
that
way
but
I
have
learned
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
because
he
IS
on
our
side
Update
Digby
writes
about
the
Clinton
Scandals
aspect
of
this
The
Clinton
scandals
were
contrived
political
character
assassination
that
were
investigated
to
the
tune
of
70
million
dollars
by
numerous
Republican
congressional
committees
and
Republican
special
prosecutors
and
WERE
PROVED
TO
BE
WITHOUT
MERIT
The
mainstream
press
were
not
muckrakers
they
were
willing
whores
and
shills
for
a
partisan
agenda
They
obsessed
over
a
decades
old
land
deal
the
firing
of
some
employees
in
the
travel
office
some
bozo
in
the
basement
reading
FBI
files
and
Clinton's
sex
life
among
many
other
trivial
charges
None
of
them
came
to
anything
These
facts
are
clear
And
I
mean
right
wing
generated
gossip
because
it's
clear
that
they
will
not
breathlessly
pursue
a
Republican
sex
scandal
with
equal
fervor
even
when
it
features
a
gay
prostitute
in
the
conservative
White
House
press
room
who
plastered
pictures
of
his
erections
all
over
the
internet
It's
been
clear
for
more
than
a
decade
that
the
mainstream
media
responds
almost
unthinkingly
to
the
deafening
sounds
of
the
right
wing
noise
machine
and
now
seems
paralyzed
by
the
power
the
Republican
establishment
exerts
over
it.So
here
we
are
We
all
watched
the
media
go
after
Clinton
who
ran
the
most
honest
public-serving
dedicated
and
intelligent
government
possibly
in
our
nation's
entire
history
We
all
watched
them
repeat
and
echo
every
single
accusation
and
lie
no
matter
how
ridiculous
And
now
we
all
watch
the
very
same
media
provide
cover
for
outright
theft
of
the
country's
savings
absolute
corporate
crony
corruption
even
wars
of
aggression
and
torture
But
it's
the
way
it
is
and
how
long
do
we
continue
to
whine
and
complain
about
it
before
we
start
DOING
something
about
it
John
is
right
they
have
taken
over
with
The
Party
increasingly
using
the
power
and
resources
of
the
state
to
enforce
one-party
rule
The
country
is
drifting
toward
corporate
fascism
and
the
question
is
how
repressive
and
violent
might
they
get
toward
us
the
enemy
within
But
the
Soviet
Union
fell
and
Marcos
and
the
Shah
and
other
entrenched
one-party
states
have
fallen
So
we
can't
give
up
hope
We
have
to
try
to
inform
the
public
and
resist
the
Right's
takeover
as
best
we
can
Giving
up
really
is
not
an
option
in
my
opinion

WHY
I
QUIT
Below
slightly
edited
is
what
I
wrote
in
response
to
this
post
by
Kevin
Drum
in
which
he
said
I
continue
to
believe
that
on
a
list
of
problems
with
the
American
media
ideological
bias
barely
cracks
the
top
ten
Remember
guys
in
theory
Kevin
is
on
our
side
This
kind
of
post
is
why
I
think
that
Kevin
is
worthless
and
a
good
part
of
the
reason
why
I
gave
up
on
blogging
the
Democratic
Party
and
the
US
Kevin
thinks
what
he
thinks
and
he's
always
thought
what
he
thought
and
please
don't
disturb
him
with
reality
The
Washington
Monthly
has
had
this
attitude
written
into
its
charter
for
decades
No
one
connected
with
that
journal
is
allowed
to
think
differently
Though
Kevin
already
thought
that
way
and
isn't
being
coerced
Kevin
you
it's
NOT
SYMMETRICAL
And
everyone
knows
it's
not
except
you
and
other
of
your
ilk
There's
a
hefty
conservative
media
in
this
country
and
there's
a
big
moderate
neutral
media
in
this
country
but
there's
only
a
puny
liberal
media
A
little
radio
almost
no
TV
or
cable
and
no
national
newspaper
Kevin
doesn't
see
this
because
he
thinks
that
he
is
the
real
left
and
that
everyone
to
his
left
is
just
plain
crazy
It's
hopeless
guys
Bush
won
and
Kevin
hasn't
even
noticed
yet
P.S
I
just
realized
that
part
of
the
problem
is
that
Kevin
is
unable
to
understand
the
idea
that
there
could
be
neutral
bias
or
centrist
bias
To
him
bias
is
only
right
left
bias
and
he's
very
happy
that
the
left
is
as
feeble
as
it
is
because
that
means
half
the
bias
is
gone
P.P.S
Someone
whose
opinion
I
greatly
respect
Dave
Johnson
believes
that
I
went
over
the
top
when
I
described
Kevin
Drum
as
Probably
he's
right
I
spent
a
year
trying
to
get
Kevin's
attention
via
civil
communication
and
it
proved
to
be
a
waste
of
time
so
I
escalated
I
basically
think
that
the
game
is
over
and
that
we're
headed
for
a
one-party
state
and
in
that
context
I
found
it
infuriating
to
read
Kevin
playing
the
same
old
moral-parity
game
and
worrying
that
liberals
might
start
acting
as
mean
as
conservatives
do
Most
of
the
Democratic
Party
seems
oblivious
to
what's
happening
So
is
this
an
apology
Who
cares
The
game
is
over
Bush
won
and
we
lost
He's
going
to
remake
the
world
and
we're
going
to
sit
and
watch

Life
Disruption
Our

is
selling
the
duplex
we
have
lived
in
for
7
years
We
have
been
given
a
60-day
notice
to
move
out
because
the
realtor
says
it
will
sell
quicker
if
it
is
empty
An

as
compared

with

We

and
have

We

so
it
will
be
hard
to
find
a

to
live
Our
whole

is
disrupted
My
wife's
mother
in
England
faced
a
similar
situation
Her
landlord
wanted
to
sell
But
England
has
some
remnants
of
socialism
so
the
landlord
was
required
to
relocate
them
into
a
similar
home
with
similar
rent
and
pay
the
moving
costs
The
idea
was
that
accepting
rent
for
providing
a
home
brought
an
obligation
to
actually
provide
a
home

In
covering
the
Iraq
war
last
year
73
percent
of
the
stories
on
Fox
News
included
the
opinions
of
the
anchors
and
journalists
reporting
them
a
new
study
says
By
contrast
29
percent
of
the
war
reports
on
MSNBC
and
2
percent
of
those
on
CNN
included
the
journalists
own
views
These
findings
the
figures
were
similar
for
coverage
of
other
stories
seem
to
challenge
Fox's
slogan
of
we
report

decide
says
the
Project
for
Excellence
in
Journalism
In
a
617-page
report
the
group
also
found
that
Fox
is
more
deeply
sourced
than
its
rivals
while
CNN
is
the
least
transparent
about
its
sources
of
the
three
cable
channels
but
more
likely
to
present
multiple
points
of
view
The
project
defines
opinion
as
views
that
are
not
attributed
to
others

Government
Spent
254
Million
Promoting
Bush's
Re-Election
From
this
story
Under
Bush
a
New
Age
of
Prepackaged
TV
News
Some
reports
were
produced
to
support
the
administration's
most
cherished
policy
objectives
like
regime
change
in
Iraq
or
Medicare
reform
Others
focused
on
less
prominent
matters
like
the
administration's
efforts
to
offer
free
after-school
tutoring
its
campaign
to
curb
childhood
obesity
its
initiatives
to
preserve
forests
and
wetlands
its
plans
to
fight
computer
viruses
even
its
attempts
to
fight
holiday
drunken
driving
They
often
feature
interviews
with
senior
administration
officials
in
which
questions
are
scripted
and
answers
rehearsed
Critics
though
are
excluded
as
are
any
hints
of
mismanagement
waste
or
controversy.One
specific
example
is
the
effort
to
promote
Bush's
scam
Medicare
bill
Note
how
the
taxpayer-funded
ads
were
coordinated
with
Bush
campaign
themes
Her
Medicare
report
for
example
was
distributed
in
January
2004
not
long
before
Mr
Bush
hit
the
campaign
trail
and
cited
the
drug
benefit
as
one
of
his
major
accomplishments
The
script
suggested
that
local
anchors
lead
into
the
report
with
this
line
In
December
President
Bush
signed
into
law
the
first-ever
prescription
drug
benefit
for
people
with
Medicare
In
the
segment
Mr
Bush
is
shown
signing
the
legislation
as
Ms
Ryan
describes
the
new
benefits
and
reports
that
all
people
with
Medicare
will
be
able
to
get
coverage
that
will
lower
their
prescription
drug
spending
The
segment
made
no
mention
of
the
many
critics
who
decry
the
law
as
an
expensive
gift
to
the
pharmaceutical
industry
The
G.A.O
found
that
the
segment
was
not
strictly
factual
that
it
contained
notable
omissions
and
that
it
amounted
to
a
favorable
report
about
a
controversial
program
And
yet
this
news
segment
like
several
others
narrated
by
Ms
Ryan
reached
an
audience
of
millions
According
to
the
accountability
office
at
least
40
stations
ran
some
part
of
the
Medicare
report
Video
news
releases
distributed
by
the
Office
of
National
Drug
Control
Policy
including
one
narrated
by
Ms
Ryan
were
shown
on
300
stations
and
reached
22
million
households.Marketing
people
know
that
254
million
buys
a
lot
of
exposure
This
reported
254
million
is
only
money
spent
by
the
government
on
pro-Bush
PR
It
does
not

Skank
Bolton
I've
been
grousing
to
myself
as
I
so
often
do
about
yet
another
Bush
appointment
John
Bolton
as
U.S
Ambassador
to
the
U.N
This
was
announced
after
Rice
swept
across
Europe
full
of
protestations
that
the
U.S
would
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
work
respectfully
with
others
Well
that
didn't
last
long
Bolton
Only
a
punk
would
nominate
Bolton
Now
I
read
a
story
that
lends
substance
to
my
churning
and
inchoate
disgust
This
article
recounts
the
sorry
history
of
the
biological
weapons
treaty
Work
on
an
enforcement
mechanism
for
this
treaty
began
in
1995
After
initially
signalling
support
the
Bush
Administration
sabotaged
it
at
the
11th
hour
sending
Bolton
after
six
years
of
work
with
the
message
that
the
U.S
did
not
support
an
enforcement
protocol
This
was
really
about
the
U.S
claiming
full
freedom
to
do
any
and
all
work
on
bio
weapons
which
it
chose
Academic
experts
were
horrified
and
predicted
a
bio
weapons
arms
race
Here
is
where
it
gets
interesting
A
year
later
China
discovered
SARS
and
tried
to
hide
it
Three
months
later
terrified
of
the
possibilities
of
its
spreading
throughout
China
and
the
world
it
notified
the
World
Health
Organization
which
immediately
organized
an
emergency
response
on
a
scale
unprecedented
for
any
new
illness
The
WHO
too
was
obviously
terrified
SARS
was
brought
under
control
but
within
the
WHO
suppressed
by
pressure
from
a
certain
superpower
was
an
analysis
of
the
SARS
virus
showing
it
to
be
an
artificial
creation
designed
to
kill
fast
and
furiously
The
conclusion
was
that
it
had
somehow
escaped
from
a
military
lab
which
explained
why
for
three
months
the
Chinese
authorities
had
hoped
to
counter
the
threat
ultimately
in
vain
In
the
end
the
Chinese
were
only
too
happy
to
have
the
analysis
suppressed
and
the
superpower
in
question
averted
a
major
worldwide
debate
on
the
need
for
a
bioweapons
treaty
with
an
enforcement
mechanism
I
wish
this
were
only
about
Bolton
Clearly
he
is
a
substantial
contributor
to
the
decline
of
international
cooperation
Unfortunately
the
real
story
is
the
resulting
decline
in
security
which
effects
each
one
of
us

The

are
run
by
the
same
guys
who
sell
toothpaste
They
show
you
an
image
of
a
sports
hero
or
a
sexy
model
or
a
car
going
up
a
sheer
cliff
or
something
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
commodity
but
it's
intended
to
delude
you
into
picking
this
one
rather
than
another
one
Same
when
they
run
elections
But
they're
assigned
that
task
in
order
to
marginalize
the
public
and
furthermore
people
are
pretty
well
aware
of
it
For
many
years
election
campaigns
here
have
been
run
by
the
public
relations
industry
and
each
time
it's
with
increasing
sophistication
Quite
naturally
the
industry
uses
the
same
technique
to
sell
candidates
that
it
uses
to
sell
toothpaste
or
lifestyle
drugs
The
point
is
to
undermine
markets
by
projecting
imagery
to
delude
and
suppressing
information-and
similarly
to
undermine
democracy
by
the
same
method

Fighting
Back
Narrow
Issues
vs
Core
Values
In
I
Have
a
Nightmare
Nicholas
Kristoff
writes
about
the
essay
The
Death
of
Environmentalism
seemingly
without
having
read
it
to
the
end
Kristoff
writes
that
the
environmental
movement
lost
credibility
by
making
alarming
claims
that
haven't
come
true
He
writes
The
Death
of
Environmentalism
notes
that
a
poll
in
2000
found
that
41
percent
of
Americans
considered
environmental
activists
to
be
extremists
There
are
many
sensible
environmentalists
of
course
but
overzealous
ones
have
tarred
the
entire
field."Is
Kristoff
unaware
that
there
is
a
well-funded
right-wing
movement
in
this
country
that
uses
lies
smears
and
humiliation
as
a
primary
tactic
to
sway
public
opinion
Extremist
is
the
wording
the
Right
uses
to
discredit
environmentalists
and
Rush
Limbaugh
uses
to
describe
environmentalists
on
his
20-some-million-listener
radio
show
No
wonder
41
percent
of
Americans
use
the
word
But
Kristoff
unintentionally
echoes
the
conventional
wisdom
of
the
Right's
smear
campaign
it's
environmentalists
fault
people
think
they're
extremists
because
they
scream
the
sky
is
falling
like
Chicken
Littles
It's
like
saying
if
only
Jews
blacks
gays
women
etc
didn't
act
that
way
people
wouldn't
hate
them
What
I
took
from
the
The
Death
of
Environmentalism
was
that
the
authors
think
money
spent
promoting
environmental
issues
might
be
better
spent
in
the
current
climate
of
public
attitudes
on
fighting
the
Right
at
a
deeper
level
promoting
core
Progressive
values
to
the
general
public
to
foster
development
of
a
sustainable
political
coalition
to
elect
candidates
who
support
environmentalism
Read
the
essay
judge
for
yourself
From
its
conclusions
While
it's
obvious
that
conservatives
control
all
three
branches
of
government
and
the
terms
of
most
political
debates
it's
not
obvious
why
This
is
because
environmentalists
and
other
liberals
have
convinced
themselves
that
in
politics
the
issues
matter
and
that
the
public
is
with
us
on
categories
such
as
the
environment
and
jobs
and
heath
care
What
explains
how
we
can
simultaneously
be
winning
on
the
issues
and
losing
so
badly
politically
Conservative
foundations
and
think
tanks
have
spent
40
years
getting
clear
about
what
they
want
their
vision
and
what
they
stand
for
their
values
Environmental
groups
have
spent
the
last
40
years
defining
themselves
against
conservative
values
like
cost-benefit
accounting
smaller
government
fewer
regulations
and
free
trade
without
ever
articulating
a
coherent
morality
we
can
call
our
own
Most
of
the
intellectuals
who
staff
environmental
groups
are
so
repelled
by
the
right's
values
that
we
have
assiduously
avoided
examining
our
own
in
a
serious
way
Environmentalists
and
other
liberals
tend
to
see
values
as
a
distraction
from
the
real
issues
environmental
problems
like
global
warming
If
environmentalists
hope
to
become
more
than
a
special
interest
we
must
start
framing
our
proposals
around
core
American
values
and
start
seeing
our
own
values
as
central
to
what
motivates
and
guides
our
politics
Doing
so
is
crucial
if
we
are
to
build
the
political
momentum
a
sustaining
movement
to
pass
and
implement
the
legislation
that
will
achieve
action
on
global
warming
and
other
issues.Read
the
entire
essay
It
represents
an
important
turning
point
in
Progressive
thinking
about
promoting
narrow-interest
issues

Square
Liberalism
Ibsen's"Enemy
of
the
People
The
plays
of
Henrik
Ibsen
dominated
European
drama
for
half
a
century
and
to
this
day
much
of
theatre
can
be
thought
of
dialectically
as
anti-Ibsen
James
Joyce
in
his
teens
was
an
Ibsenist
who
taught
himself
Dano-Norwegian
in
order
to
read
the
plays
in
the
original
and
in
the
stories
in
Dubliners
to
say
nothing
of
some
of
his
youthful
works
you
can
still
see
signs
of
Ibsen's
realism
though
without
Ibsen's
reformist
message
According
to
Kenneth
Rexroth
the
slang
word
square
came
from
squarehead
the
seaman's
ethnic
slur
for
the
relatively-stodgy
Scandinavians
among
them
and
Ibsen
was
the
squarest
person
in
the
world
For
him
right
was
right
truth
was
truth
and
if
there's
a
problem
something
should
be
done
about
it
The
Enemy
of
the
People
was
probably
Ibsen's
squarest
play
Doctor
Stockman
a
highly-respected
M.D
and
community
leader
in
a
small
Norwegian
town
discovers
that
the
mineral
waters
of
the
town's
soon-to-be-opened
health
spa
have
been
made
toxic
by
bacterial
contamination
He
starts
to
get
the
word
out
and
proposes
a
solution
but
as
the
play
progresses
his
friends
and
allies
including
the
moderate
reformists
and
liberals
turn
against
him
one
by
one
At
the
end
of
the
play
he
stands
alone
having
been
officially
declared
an
enemy
of
the
people
Recently
the
dramatist
Christopher
Hampton
retranslated
the
play
From
his
Introduction
However
sympathetic
he
feels
for
Dr
Stockman's
cause
Ibsen
is
too
subtle
and
profound
a
dramatist
not
to
know
that
there
are
few
figures
more
infuriating
than
the
man
who
is
always
right
Stockmann's
sincerity
naivety
and
courage
co-exist
with
an
innocent
vanity
an
inability
to
compromise
and
an
indifference
to
the
havoc
caused
in
the
life
of
his
family
and
friends
as
well
as
his
own
by
his
dogged
pursuit
of
principle
Hampton
is
wrong
Ibsen
was
a
square
and
he
wrote
the
play
to
show
that
Doctor
Stockman
was
right
and
that
his
cowardly
corrupt
thuggish
enemies
were
wrong
Everyone
in
town
except
Stockman
was
willing
to
market
a
toxic
health
spa
to
sick
people
An
Enemy
of
the
People
is
a
square
play
Partly
for
that
reason
it
may
not
be
Ibsen's
best
play
but
the
moral
of
the
story
is
absolutely
clear
Like
a
parson
bowdlerizing
Shakespeare
Hampton
felt
the
need
to
misrepresent
Ibsen
in
order
to
make
him
palatable
to
the
cynical
modern
audience
I
have
speculated
elsewhere
that
we
may
now
be
living
in
a
post-ethical
age
I
didn't
say
in
so
many
words
that
I
think
that
this
is
a
bad
thing
but
it
is
Democrats
and
liberals
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
make
a
strong
moral
statement
to
the
voters
and
this
is
because
the
so-called
Left
has
been
dominated
by
a
combination
of
shrewd
careerist
inside
players
and
hedonistic
personal
liberationists
preaching
relativism
It
should
have
been
possible
to
achieve
tolerance
and
diversity
without
making
moral
relativism
into
an
absolute
principle
but
that's
the
strategy
that
ended
up
being
chosen
The
outcome
has
been
crippling
There
are
square
arguments
for
liberalism
but
in
the
world
of
today
only
the
cynical
Rovian
right
can
to
appeal
to
squares

Blow
To
Small
Business
Creation
I
predict
that
the
new
bankruptcy
bill
will
have
a
damping
effect
on
the
formation
of
small
businesses
and
this
will
be
one
more
blow
to
job
creation
This
bill
makes
it
just
too
much
of
a
risk
to
borrow
money
to
open
a
laundromat
or
buy
a
Subway
sandwich
franchise
I
have
a
friend
who
is
a
dentist
He
has
been
hoping
to
one
day
open
a
practice
with
his
wife
also
a
dentist
But
that
takes
money
Hearing
about
the
bankruptcy
bill
he
said
this
might
just
clinch
it
that
they
won't
be
opening
that
private
practice
This
is
what
got
me
thinking
about
the
effect
this
could
have
on
a
national
scale
scaring
people
away
from
their
dream
of
one
day
having
their
own
independent
business

Saddam
Capture
Another
Lie
Ex-Marine
Says
Public
Version
of
Saddam
Capture
Fiction
A
former
U.S
Marine
who
participated
in
capturing
ousted
Iraqi
President
Saddam
Hussein
said
the
public
version
of
his
capture
was
fabricated
Ex-Sgt
Nadim
Abou
Rabeh
of
Lebanese
descent
was
quoted
in
the
Saudi
daily
al-Medina
Wednesday
as
saying
Saddam
was
actually
captured
Friday
Dec
12
2003
and
not
the
day
after
as
announced
by
the
U.S
Army
I
was
among
the
20-man
unit
including
eight
of
Arab
descent
who
searched
for
Saddam
for
three
days
in
the
area
of
Dour
near
Tikrit
and
we
found
him
in
a
modest
home
in
a
small
village
and
not
in
a
hole
as
announced
Abou
Rabeh
said
We
captured
him
after
fierce
resistance
during
which
a
Marine
of
Sudanese
origin
was
killed
he
said
He
said
Saddam
himself
fired
at
them
with
a
gun
from
the
window
of
a
room
on
the
second
floor
Then
they
shouted
at
him
in
Arabic
You
have
to
surrender
There
is
no
point
in
resisting
Later
on
a
military
production
team
fabricated
the
film
of
Saddam's
capture
in
a
hole
which
was
in
fact
a
deserted
well

Do
Dems
Ban
Pro-Life
Convention
Speakers
The
subject
of
whether
Democrats
ban
pro-life
speakers
at
their
conventions
is
going
around
again
This
originated
after
anti-choice
Pennsylvania
Governor
Casey
was
not
allowed
to
address
the
1992
Democratic
National
Convention
because
he
refused
to
endorse
then-Governor
Clinton
for
President
No
More
Mister
Nice
Blog
has
a
great
post
on
the
subject
and
he
uses
the
magic
words
conventional
wisdom
Kevin
Drum
has
recently
written
about
it
as
have
Atrios
and
Digby
It
so
happens
that
the
myth
that
Democrats
don't
allow
pro-life
speakers
at
their
conventions
came
up
at
a
dinner
party
at
the
home
of
some
strongly
Christian
friends
just
before
last
year's
election
These
friends
tend
to
be
Democratic
voters
but
had
been
getting
handouts
and
magazines
at
their
church
designed
to
persuade
them
to
vote
Republican
One
thing
my
friends
had
heard
repeatedly
was
particularly
influential
They
were
saying
they
were
likely
to
vote
for
Bush
because
Democrats
don't
allow
pro-life
people
to
speak
at
their
conventions
I
also
hear
this
repeated
all
the
time
and
it
has
become
conventional
wisdom
You
probably
know
that
the
Republicans
usually
add
that
Republicans
are
the
party
of
the
big
tent
In
fact
you
probably
hear
this
repeated
word-for-word
because
that's
how
these
things
work
The
Democrats
don't
allow
and
Republicans
are
party
of
big
tent
seems
to
be
a
powerful
influential
combination
for
persuading
potential
voters
But
I
didn't
realize
just
how
powerful
an
effect
these
words
had
on
people
until
that
dinner
party
So
I
did
some
research
Here
is
the
record
Pro-Life
Democrats
speaking
at
the
2004
convention
Two
members
of
Democrats
for
Life
were
among
speakers
at
the
party's
convention
Rep
Jim
Turner
of
Texas
was
speaking
in
the
context
of
his
role
as
ranking
minority
member
of
the
Homeland
Security
Committee
Rep
Jim
Langevin
of
Rhode
Island
introduced
Ron
Reagan
also
pro-life
who
spoke
in
favor
of
embryonic
stem-cell
research.2000
Convention
The
Catholic
Herald
Eight
years
after
he
was
denied
a
forum
at
the
Democratic
convention
the
late
Pennsylvania
Governor
Robert
P
Casey
was
given
a
few
moments
in
the
national
spotlight
On
the
closing
day
of
the
Democratic
National
Convention
in
Los
Angeles
the
governors
two
sons
got
the
chance
to
make
their
fathers
points
about
the
sanctity
of
life
With
just
a
few
sentences
each
the
brothers
two
of
eight
siblings
described
their
father
as
a
proud
pro-life
Democrat
who
believed
every
life
born
and
unborn
is
sacred
That's
why
he
was
a
Democrat

I
welcome
you
to
the
City
of
Angels
with
all
its
vibrant
religious
ethnic
and
racial
diversity
I
come
to
this
great
convening
out
of
respect
for
our
nation's
democratic
traditions
I
come
as
a
pastor
not
a
politician
an
advocate
of
values
not
candidates
As
you
gathered
your
people
into
the
land
that
was
promised
to
them
you
called
them
to
heed
your
voice
and
follow
your
commandments
These
commandments
are
at
once
simple
and
profound
To
love
God
above
all
else
and
to
love
our
neighbor
as
ourselves
We
have
been
called
to
choose
life
and
to
serve
the
least
of
these
In
the
span
of
just
three
weeks
our
nation's
major
political
parties
will
have
gathered
at
their
conventions
to
select
their
candidates
for
the
upcoming
presidential
campaign
We
pray
tonight
that
your
Spirit
will
inspire
all
candidates
regardless
of
party
to
embody
in
their
words
actions
and
policies
values
that
protect
all
human
life
establish
peace
promote
justice
and
uphold
the
common
good
For
it
is
in
you
O
God
that
we
trust
In
You
O
God
we
trust
that
you
will
keep
us
ever
committed
to
protect
the
life
and
well-being
of
all
people
but
especially
unborn
children
the
sick
and
the
elderly
those
on
skid
row
and
those
on
death
row
We
make
our
prayer
in
your
name
Amen.1996
Democratic
Convention
Congressman
Tony
Hall
of
Ohio
Mr
Chairman
and
fellow
Democrats
I
have
the
high
honor
of
speaking
to
you
today
about
an
issue
that's
very
dear
to
my
heart
the
needs
of
the
vulnerable
in
our
nation
the
poor
the
sick
the
elderly
the
children
and
the
unborn
The
moral
test
of
government
Hubert
Humphrey
said
is
how
that
government
treats
those
that
are
in
the
dawn
of
life
the
children
those
who
are
in
the
twilight
of
life
the
elderly
and
those
who
are
in
the
shadows
of
life
the
sick
I'm
a
pro-life
Democrat
I'm
one
of
about
40
Democrats
in
the
Congress
And
many
of
us
have
felt
left
out
by
our
party's
position
on
abortion
for
many
years
But
this
year
is
different
For
the
first
time
the
Democratic
Party
has
included
in
our
Platform
a
conscience
clause
on
this
divisive
issue
It
says
the
Democratic
Party
therefore
recognizes
that
individual
members
have
a
right
to
abide
by
their
conscience
on
this
difficult
issue
and
are
welcome
participants
at
every
level
of
the
party
The
Democratic
Party
is
indeed
the
party
of
true
inclusions
And
it
is
the
party
where
every
American
can
feel
welcome
and
at
home
We
Democrats
believe
that
our
government
and
our
whole
society
will
be
judged
on
how
we
treat
the
least
of
these
among
us
So
we
renew
our
pledge
to
be
a
voice
for
the
voiceless
and
we
reaffirm
our
commitment
to
the
principle
that
public
service
is
not
an
end
in
itself
but
rather
a
means
to
serve
others
With
God's
help
let
us
make
the
United
States
the
compassionate
and
tolerant
nation
it
was
established
to
be
Thank
you
very
much."So
the
fact
is
that
the
Democratic
Party
conventions
HAVE
had
so-called
pro-life
speakers
including
the
2000
invocation
by
a
Catholic
Archbishop
who
is
obviously
against
abortion
talking
about
protecting
unborn
children
And
the
fact
remains
that
Gov.Casey
did
refuse
to
endorse
the
nominee
that
year
Add
to
this
that
his
kids
were
allowed
to
give
a
pro-life
speech
at
the
next
convention
Democrats
simply
do
NOT
ban
pro-life
speakers
But
they
DO
ban
speakers
who
refuse
to
endorse
the
nominee
As
my
dinner-party
friends
can
testify
the
story
carries
great
weight
in
persuading
people
to
not
support
Democrats
by
convincing
them
that
Democrats
are
elitists
who
ban
pro-life
speakers
banning
people
who
are
like
them
while
Republicans
are
inclusive
big
tent
people
embracing
people
who
are
like
them
So
it
is
greatly
to
the
benefit
of
the
Republicans
that
the
lie
continue
to
circulate
Repetition
is
the
key
to
making
people
believe
things
This
is
an
urban
myth
that
is
useful
and
powerful
so
it
continues
to
be
repeated
This
is
another
example
of
the
use
of
repetition
of
simple
phrases
to
create
conventional
wisdom
or
what
we
call
truisms
Such
conventional
wisdoms
include
phrases
like
Social
Security
is
going
broke
He
gassed
his
own
people
and
Children
trapped
in
failing
public
schools
Finally
let
me
remind
you
of
the
Seeing
the
Forest
rule
when
Republicans
accuse
others
it
probably
means
it
is
something
they
are
doing
From
a
pre-convention
Washington
Times
a
pro-Republican
newspaper
story
More
than
half
the
Republicans
in
the
House
have
signed
a
formal
complaint
to
President
Bush
about
the
failure
to
give
prominent
conservative
pro-life
party
members
even
one
prime-time
speaking
role
at
the
Republican
National
Convention

Surprise
America's
priorities
not
on
radar
of
Republicratic
Party
The
Program
on
International
Policy
Attitudes
PIPA
just
release
the
results
of
a
poll
on
the
budgetary
priorities
of
the
average
American
citizen
Just
to
show
you
how
profoundly
out
of
touch
the
leadership
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
in
Washington
is
let
me
ask
this
question
when
was
the
last
time
you
heard
a
spokesperson
or
even
a
leading
light
of
either
party
suggest
cutting
the
defense
budget
by
anything
approaching
31
the
overall
average
amount)?(*1
Who
would
think
from
the
natterings
of
our
pundit
class
that
65
of
the
American
public
Democrats
and
Republicans
alike
would
favor
cutting
the
defense
budget
and
redirecting
a
significant
proportion
of
the
resulting
savings
into
social
services
and
deficit
reduction
efforts
I
found
out
about
this
via
an
article
on
Truthout
my
mother
sent
it
to
me
this
afternoon
Here's
the
article's
sub-header
Would
reduce
deficit
cut
defense
sharply
and
increase
spending
on
education
job
training
renewable
energy
veterans
Sounds
like
a
program
I
could
get
behind
This
is
all
the
more
astounding
considering
the
ongoing
effort
by
The
Mighty
Wurlitzer
to
confound
and
confuse
the
American
public
It
appears
all
they've
managed
to
do
is
confuse
and
confound
our
political
ruling
class
and
the
media
elite
that
cover
them
but
on
the
other
hand
I
guess
that's
all
they
need
to
do
right
At
least
until
those
of
us
at
the
bottom
of
the
political
food
chain
start
voting
people
out
of
office
on
a
regular
basis
If
there
is
a
single
politician
in
Washington
who
has
suggested
reallocating
our
budgetary
priorities
in
the
manner
outlined
in
this
article
or
anything
even
reasonably
close
I'd
like
to
know
because
I
certainly
haven't
seen
anything
to
that
effect
My
guess
is
there
isn't
Even
among
the
progressives

The
Green
Party's
platform
in
both
2000
and
2004
called
for
cutting
the
defense
budget
by
50
here's
the
relevant
language
from
the
2004
platform
Our
defense
budget
has
increased
out
of
all
proportion
to
any
military
threat
to
the
United
States
and
to
our
domestic
social
economic
and
environmental
needs
The
United
States
government
must
reduce
our
defense
budget
to
half
of
its
current
size
The
2005
defense
budget
is
estimated
at
around
425
billion
and
that
does
not
take
into
account
military
expenditures
not
placed
under
the
defense
budget
Take
a
look
at
the
Green
Party's
platform
and
see
what
you
think
even
though
I
don't
agree
with
all
of
it(*2
I
think
there's
a
ton
of
stuff
in
there
to
like
and
that
is
far
more
in
alignment
with
the
values
of
the
average
American
exclusive
of
a
few
hot
button
issues
than
not
2
I
think
the
steady-state
economy
stuff
is
based
on
the
faulty
assumption
that
economic
growth
is
dependent
on
the
ever
increasing
consumption
of
natural
resources
as
a
technologist
whose
career
has
been
built
on
automating
systems
to
enable
more
to
be
done
with
less
I
think
I
have
plenty
of
evidence
to
argue
otherwise

Credit
Cards
In
case
you
haven't
heard
there's
a
new
bankruptcy
bill
making
its
way
through
Congress
Read
up
on
it
here
here
and
here
Kevin
Drum
points
out
that
Bottom
line
credit
card
companies
now
make
half
their
profits
from
penalties
and
late
fees
They
actively
seek
out
customers
who
are
likely
to
miss
payments
and
end
up
in
a
penalty
fee
spiral
and
they
make
a
fortune
from
them.""And
where
does
the
bankruptcy
bill
come
into
this
Credit
card
companies
want
the
ability
to
make
risky
loans
but
they
also
want
federal
protection
that
protects
them
from
bearing
the
risk
that
goes
along
with
making
those
loans
That's
a
pretty
cushy
setup
as
long
as
you
can
buy
yourself
enough
politicians
to
make
it
happen
Apparently
they
can."He
also
writes
here
about
amendments
offered
by
Democrats
that
Republicans
voted
down
and
other
details
The
poor
get
shafted
the
very
real
crisis
of
medical
bankruptcy
is
ignored
the
rich
are
allowed
loopholes
that
let
them
off
the
hook
and
credit
card
companies
can
continue
on
their
merry
way
knowing
they
won't
have
to
pay
the
price
for
their
own
folly."I
stopped
using
credit
cards
several
years
ago
It's
AMAZING
how
good
it
feels
to
be
free
of
monthly
payments
and
interest
charges
Why
would
I
want
to
contribute
to
the
machine
If
I
can't
just
pay
for
something
I
just
don't
buy
it

Bloggers

Here
is
another
story
that
needs
to
gain
wider
attention
Brit
Hume

Resign
Oliver
Willis
has
been
on
this
for
25
days
and
we
should
all
join
him
by
blogging
about
it
writing
letters
and
making
phone
calls
Here's
the
background
On
February
3rd
Hume
intentionally
manipulated
the
words
of
the
32nd
president
Franklin
Delano
Roosevelt
to
make
it
appear
as
if
FDR
supported
privatization
of
social
security
This
is
a
brazen
falsehood
President
Roosevelt's
grandson
James
Roosevelt
Jr
describes
Hume's
journalistic
malfeasance
as
an
an
outrageous
distortion
We
agree.This
is
far
more
serious
than
anything
Dan
Rather
was
accused
of
But
Hume
is
getting
away
with
it
because
we
aren't
making
enough
noise
Go
read
about
it
and
make
some
noise

The

of

government
programs
can
be

affirmative
good
Social
Security
works
It's
more
efficient
more
fair
and
more
inexpensive
than
any
of
the
alternatives
People
apparently
instinctively
know
this
Since
the
Republicans
decided
to
bring
this
to
the
forefront
we
should
take
credit
for
it
and
piggyback
our
new
progressive
ideas
on
its
back
It's
been
so
long
since
anyone
had
the
nerve
to
do
it
that
it
sounds
downright
fresh
Just
as
in
the
1930's
the
Republicans
of
today
simply
don't
believe
in
the
idea
of
a
moral
and
decent
society
Their
policy
is
to
align
themselves
with
powerful
moneyed
forces
to
tilt
the
playing
field
in
their
favor
and
let
everybody
else
fend
for
themselves
That's
the
essence
of
the
argument
and
one
that
I
think
we
can
win
if
we
care
to
wage
it.Digby
finds
words
from
FDR
that
do
sound
fresh
and
inspiring
There's
more
good
stuff
so
go
read
And
in
Mr
Positive
Digby
writes
I
still
maintain
that
whenever
somebody
says
that
we
must
present
an
alternative
we
should
say
We
have
presented
the
alternative
It's
called
Social
Security
It
works
very
very
well
and
Democrats
are
damned
proud
to
have
created
it."And
in
Listening
To
Liberals
Digby
writes
And
here
is
one
liberal
who
doesn't
believe
that
everything
that
comes
out
of
the
unregulated
free
market
is
good
culturally
For
instance
I
think
that
right
wing
talk
radio
is
the
biggest
cultural
pollutant
in
our
society
I
can't
conceive
of
anything
more
pernicious
than
hours
and
hours
of
eliminationist
rhetoric
lies
and
propaganda
being
pumped
into
people's
cars
offices
and
homes
throughout
the
country
Somehow
I
just
can't
get
as
worked
up
about
fictional
cable
television
shows
that
feature
nudity
and
profanity
when
real
live
Americans
spend
the
day
listening
to
people
talk
about
me
in
ways
that
sound
an
awful
lot
like
they'd
like
to
kill
me.All

2005
Social
Security
and
2018
President
Bush
was
on
the
news
talking
about
the
crisis
that
Social
Security
faces
in
2018
I
haven't
heard
the
truth
about
this
repeated
often
enough
so
here
it
is
Everyone
who
makes
90,000
or
less
pays
a
big
chunk
of
their
income
into
the
Social
Security
Trust
Fund
This
money
was
supposed
to
be
saved
to
pay
for
our
retirement
Bush
called
this
saved-up
retirement
money
the
people's
money
and
used
it
to
pay
for
huge
tax
cuts
for
the
rich
So
while
OUR
taxes
were
supposed
to
be
building
up
a
huge
reserve
for
OUR
retirement
Bush
has
been
giving
it
to
the
rich
It
is
projected
that
Social
Security
will
stop
bringing
in
extra
revenue
in
approx
2018
This
is
where
the
money
that
was
supposed
to
be
saved
comes
into
play
Bush
spent
it
and
doesn't
want
to
pay
it
back
THAT
is
why
he
says
there
is
a
crisis
in
2018
Bush
says
this
is
Social
Security's
problem
He
calls
it
a
crisis
and
says
we
need
to
cut
benefits
I
think
it
is
Social
Security's
problem
like
it's
the
bank's
problem
if
I
can't
come
up
with
the
mortgage
payment
and
I
tell
the
bank
they
need
to
lay
people
off
so
they
don't
need
my
money

CNET
The
coming
crackdown
on
blogging
Declan
McCullagh's
latest
is
an
interview
with
Bradley
Smith
a
Republican
FEC
commissioner
about
the
potential
effects
of
being
forced
to
apply
McCain-Feingold
campaign
donation
regulations
to
the
Internet
Here's
the
first
paragraph
In
just
a
few
months
he
warns
bloggers
and
news
organizations
could
risk
the
wrath
of
the
federal
government
if
they
improperly
link
to
a
campaign's
Web
site
Even
forwarding
a
political
candidate's
press
release
to
a
mailing
list
depending
on
the
details
could
be
punished
by
fines
Apparently
perhaps
because
of
the
Talon
News/GOPUSA
scandal
the
regulatory
issue
has
produced
a
partisan
split--there
was
a
3-3
vote
to
not
to
appeal
the
Internet
related
portion
of
Judge
Kollar-Kotelly's
latest
order
I'm
not
sure
what
the
Democratic
Party
appointees
rationale
for
this
vote
was
they're
not
quoted
but
at
least
on
the
surface
the
postulated
outcome
is
fairly
alarming
links
to
candidate
websites
being
categorized
as
campaign
donations
along
with
forwarding
press
releases
to
email
lists
for
example
UPDATE:Ellen
Weintraub
who
is
apparently
acting
as
a
spokesperson
for
the
Democratic
Party
FEC
appointees
has
this
to
say
about
the
issue

Fighting
Back
Here
is
a
comment
I
left
over
at
Digby's
blog
Edited
to
make
me
look
better
I
come
out
of
marketing
and
marketing
people
know
that
if
you
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
repeat
something
over
and
over
it
will
effectively
get
many
if
not
most
people
to
think
that
whatever
you
are
saying
is
true
That's
why
people
think
that
one
soap
is
better
than
another
or
Shell
is
better
than
the
no-brand
discount
gas
station
etc
And
the
Right
has
spent
a
lot
of
money
billions
and
built
up
the
channels
for
repeating
things
over
and
over
It's
really
a
very
simple
basic
thing
if
you
think
about
it
They
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
repeat
a
core
ideology
and
people
start
to
accept
it
Duh
So
what
do
we
do
about
it
We
start
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
repeat
over
and
over
that
Progressive
solutions
are
better
for
regular
people
And
we
learn
how
to
do
it
with
modern
marketing
methods
We
learn
how
to
craft
a
message
specifically
for
this
demographic
or
that
demographic
etc
We
learn
how
to
craft
our
message
into
language
that
resonates
emotionally
etc
We
fund
organizations
that
train
Progressives
in
media
techniques
so
they
come
across
better
on
TV
We
do
all
the
things
the
Right
is
doing
which
are
all
the
things
modern
corporations
do
to
sell
soap
to
you
It
really
is
just
like
selling
soap
But
I
think
the
core
is
that
we
have
to
start
repeating
the
UNDERLYING
message
that
Progressive
values
benefit
regular
people
THEN
we
tie
narrow
issues
to
those
underlying
values
That
is
the
key
thing
the
Right
has
learned
about
how
to
sell
their
issues
They
start
by
selling
the
ideas
that
underly
the
issues
After
people
come
to
accept
these
underlying
ideas
THEN
they
tie
it
to
the
issues
And
all
of
this
gets
your
candidates
elected
So
spending
money
on
this
is
better
and
longer
lasting
than
money
spent
on
election
cycle
stuff

Corporate
Radio
vs
fringe
rock
and
pop
Mark
Morford's
latest
column
All
Hail
The
Death
of
Radio
is
a
long
rant
about
the
utter
suckage
of
corporate
radio
His
usual
brilliant
dissection
of
the
pathetic
I
sent
him
a
note
about
KPIG
Here's
what
KPIG
says
about
themselves
http://www.kpig.com/info.html
What
is
KPIG
We're
an
anachronism
a
throwback
to
the
days
when
real
DJs
picked
out
the
music
and
listeners
expected
something
more
from
a
radio
station
than
just
a
couple
of
hundred
songs
repeated
over
and
over
with
some
big
voice
guy
yelling
about
how
great
it
all
is
We're
also
to
the
amazement
of
all
of
the
radio
professionals
who
make
the
rules
we
thumb
our
noses
at
very
successful
though
we
try
not
to
let
it
go
to
our
heads
And
yes
they
are
successful
with
a
weak
signal
they
regularly
challenge
ClearChannel
stations
for
top
ratings
in
their
local
market
this
link
R&R
labels
it
a
Triple
A
station
which
is
defined
thusly
http://www.radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/format?code=aaa
Radio
Station
Format
Definitions
Adult
Album
Alternative
Triple-A
stations
target
an
adult
audience
with
a
large
variety
of
music
that
hovers
on
the
fringe
of
mainstream
pop
and
rock
including
Americana
alternative
rock
alternative
country
blues
folk
and
world
music
The
selections
stay
away
from
rap
or
any
of
the
hard
stuff
Typical
artists
heard
on
AAA
stations
include
Shawn
Colvin
Eric
Clapton
Amiee
Mann
David
Gray
Bob
Dylan
Cowboy
Junkies
Dave
Mathews
Band
U2
Tracy
Chapman
R.E.M
Train
Blues
Traveler
Cold
Play
Depeche

Interesting
so
all
these
bands
and
singers
are
on
fringe
of
mainstream
pop
and
rock
Tracy
Chapman
R.E.M
Bob
Dylan
Dave
Mathews

U2
Depeche

Says
a
lot
about
corporate
radio
doesn't
it
Incidentally
these
aren't
the
bands
that
KPIG
typically
plays
95
of
the
time
when
I
tune
them
in
I
hear
something
I've
never
heard
before
and
sometimes
I
even
like
it
Mark
Morford
says
that
this
recently
happened
to
him
for
the
first
time
since
1996
Corporate
America's
lack
of
imagination
and
risk-aversion
is
costing
it
a
fortune
and
improvershing
our
culture
in
the
process
as
KPIG's
success
demonstrates
by
contrast

that

They
claimed
that

would
ENABLE
the

So
now
none

are
encrypted
and
pretty
much
anyone
can
listen
in.The

If

it
means
they
are
DOING

They
accused

on
everyone's
conversations
So
today
no
one
has
encryption
with
the
result
that
anyone
can
listen

how

A

A

is
going

I
mean
a

Speculators
Seeing
Gold
in

Boom
in

Prices
for
Homes
In
several
metropolitan
areas
from
Miami
to
Riverside
Calif
where
the
real
estate
market
is
white
hot
rapidly
rising
prices
are
luring
a
growing
number
of
ordinary
people
into
buying
and
selling
residences
they
do
not
intend
to
occupy
despite
warnings
from
some
economists
that
prices
cannot
continue
to
rise
as
steeply
as
they
have
in
the
last
few
years
Like
the
day
traders
of
the
1990's
dot-com
boom
people
are
investing
in
a
market
that
seems
to
just
go
up
These
buyers
some
of
whom
lost
money
when
the
stock
market
crashed
five
years

believe
real

is
a
safer
bet

million

investors
are
piling
into
the
market
brokers
say
They
rent
it
out
for
2,225
a
month
about
1,000
less
than
their
mortgage
and
maintenance
costs
The
couple
hope
to
make
up
the
shortfall
when
they
sell
the
condo
in
a
few
years
It
seems
that
real
estate
always
goes
up
in
the
long
term
Ms
Finley
said
With
more
than
60,000
units
in
some
phase
of
development
in
the
Miami
area
the
supply
may
be
greater
than
the
ultimate
demand
said
Michael
Y
Cannon
managing
director
of
Integra
Realty
Resources-South
Florida
a
market
analyst
A
similar
situation
in
1986
sent
the
market
spiraling
and
it
took
seven
years
to
recover
For
now
investors
like
the
Lidskys
are
still
buying
They
intend
to
buy
at
least
one
more
unit
their
sixth
in
less
than
a
year
in
another
condo.Oh
it's
going
to
be
bad
Really
really
bad

I'm
taking
another
break
I
won't
be
posting
for
awhile
while
I'm
thinking
things
over
In
the
past
I've
always
come
back
eventually
but
I'm
not
promising
anything
I
really
dread
the
next
four
years
I
expect
the
worst
from
Bush
specifically
war
fever
plus
McCarthyism
There
have
been
a
number
of
positive
changes
in
the
Democratic
party
but
Democrats
as
a
group
still
don't
seem
prepared
for
what's
going
to
happen
and
it
may
be
too
little
too
late
At
the
beginning
of
my
blogging
career
I
was
happy
just
to
vent
but
over
the
last
year
or
so
I've
tried
to
figure
out
a
way
to
make
something
of
my
political
writing
That
really
hasn't
happened
I
still
seem
to
be
speaking
to
the
same
small
audience
of
people
who
basically
already
agree
with
me
without
really
getting
my
message
out
the
generic
Democrats
or
the
big-time
bloggers
much
less
the
party
leadership
I
will
always
be
angry
about
the
crappy
2004
campaign
the
overpaid
consultants
and
the
unresponsive
and
bureaucratic
Democratic
Party
and
Kerry
campaign
and
especially
the
New
Dems
who
are
only
now
finally
realizing
that
perhaps
their
destruction
of
the
left
wing
of
the
Democratic
party
left
them
vulnerable
to
attack
Lieberman's
hot
wet
kiss
with
Bush
at
the
State
of
the
Union
speech
was
just
the
killing
blow
I
noticed
that
Martin
Peretz
has
just
offered
the
Democrats
some
helpful
advice
The
man
who
gave
us
Michael
Kelly
Charles
Krauthammer
Mickey
Kaus
and
Andrew
Sullivan
The
neocon
who
stayed
behind
to
fight
a
rear-guard
battle
against
the
enemy
and
subvert
him
i.e
us
The
fifth
columnist
The
media
is
hopeless
and
we
need
something
completely
new
a
new
national
newspaper
new
national
TV
and
cable
networks
and
a
new
national
radio
network
Radio
is
only
halfway
there
and
the
others
don't
exist
at
all
It
would
all
cost
about
half
a
billion
and
while
people
tell
me
that
the
money
is
out
there
I
don't
see
much
happening
Right
now
there
is
no
career
track
for
openly
liberal
openly
Democratic
media
people
You
can
sit
back
and
watch
all
of
them
fudging
refusing
to
burn
bridges
and
primping
their
moderation
cred
hoping
for
that
invitation
to
go
on
TV
or
maybe
even
to
write
for
the
Times
eventually
like
the
liberal
Kristoff
I
might
also
mention
that
there's
a
considerable
pool
of
talented
bloggers
out
here
who've
been
self-financing
all
along
while
the
dud
consultants
have
been
pulling
down
six-figure
incomes
for
losing
over
and
over
again
After
awhile
that
kind
of
thing
gets
old
and
I
know
of
at
least
two
well-respected
bloggers
who
are
just
plain
flat
broke
Republican
bloggers
seem
to
get
support
although
they
don't
necessarily
tell
anyone
about
it
I
think
that
the
academic
and
administrative
roots
of
most
Democratic
leaders
disable
them
for
the
hoodlum
politics
of
today
They're
used
to
describing
reality
as
it
is
at
a
given
moment
managing
things
keeping
the
lid
on
and
judging
people
by
their
credentials
They're
cool
and
civil
and
don't
know
how
to
respond
to
deliberate
provocation
or
to
people
whose
goal
is
to
shake
things
up
and
change
things
The
Republicans
by
contrast
hire
semi-criminal
entrepreneurs
and
give
them
a
chance
to
show
what
they
can
do
And
the
Republicans
win
The
whole
reality-based
slogan
is
utter
crap
Democrats
deal
with
the
world
as
it
is
and
Republicans
deal
with
the
world
as
it
can
be
made
to
be
That's
why
the
Democrats
are
always
blindsided
and
why
the
Republicans
always
win
The
Democrats
are
yesterday
and
the
Republicans
are
tomorrow
The
point
is
not
to
understand
the
world
but
to
change
it
And
for
those
who
don't
understand
it
yet
character
means
among
other
things
macho
The
can-do
hands-on
do-what-you-gotta-do
thing
The
academic
habit
of
discussing
everything
to
death
is
not
what
you're
looking
for
in
the
man
in
charge
Macho
Margaret
Thatcher
had
it
Indira
Gandhi
had
it
Golda
Meir
had
it
It's
not
just
a
guy
thing
The
United
States
has
been
taken
over
by
a
cult
the
hardcore
30
who
think
that
that
nuclear
war
is
a
fun
idea
that
France
is
an
enemy
nation
that
the
Confederacy
was
perfectly
wonderful
that
Armageddon
is
coming
soon
and
is
something
to
pray
for
and
that
the
federal
government
should
be
starved
to
death
They're
the
bad
guys
but
the
ones
who
you
really
have
to
blame
are
the
ones
who
don't
bother
and
don't
care
the
cynics
the
apathetic
the
non-voters
the
game-players
the
media
careerists
and
the
self-described
moderates
By
the
time
those
guys
get
the
idea
it
will
probably
be
too
late
The
American
people
have
spoken
and
sometimes
you
end
up
feeling
that
the
problem
is
really
them
P.S
I
meant
to
say
this
the
first
time
the
absence
of
a
liberal
Democratic
media
career
track
also
pulls
Democratic
political
pros
and
even
Democratic
politicians
to
the
right
They
always
have
to
think
about
what
they
do
afterwards
so
they
don't
want
to
burn
any
bridges
either
Bill
O'Reilly
Chris
Matthews
Susan
Estrich
and
George
Stephanopolous
are
the
worst
examples
I
can
think
of
but
there
are
tons
of
them

New
Report
Social
Security
Administration
Politicized
The
Stakeholder
talks
about
a
new
report
on
the
politicization
of
the
Social
Security
Administration
From
the
post
Pelosi
Waxman
SSA
Politicized
The
report
based
on
a
review
of
over
4,000
pages
of
Social
Security
documents
from
1995
to
2005
reveals
that
the
agency
has
systematically
altered
agency
publications
press
releases
PowerPoint
presentations
website
content
and
even
its
annual
statements
to
foster
the
impression
that
Social
Security
is
unsustainable
and
must
change
The
agency's
new
pessimistic
tone
and
emphasis
echo
President
Bush's
warnings
about
the
future
of
Social
Security."This
is
a
blatantly
illegal
use
of
a
government
agency
to
promote
a
political
party
unprecedented
in
American
history
but
who
will
do
anything
about
it
The
Republicans
in
Congress
will
block
any
attempts
at
oversight
The
Justice
Department's
job
now
is
to
enforce
Party
ideology
instead
of
American
laws
The
Federalist
Society
judges
are
in
place
to
block
any
non-Party
law
enforcement
attempts
The
media
is
intimidated
and
non-functional
you
probably
won't
even
see
anything
about
this
report
in
the
mainstream
press
We
are
the
frog
in
the
water
as
it
heats
and
the
water
is
starting
to
bubble
now
It
has
been
coming
on
slowly
and
seems
like
just
a
very
small
step
away
from
the
tricks
and
schemes
we
were
reading
about
a
month
ago
But
think
back
Before
Bush
came
along
the
idea
of
a
government
agency
telling
the
public
to
support
one
political
party's
ideology
over
another's
while
Congress
refused
to
do
anything
about
it
was
unimaginable
in
America
This
is
how
things
like
the
Soviet
Union
come
about
when
government
agencies
ignore
the
country's
laws
and
promote
The
Party
and
get
away
with
it
Look
where
we
are
with
Party
control
over
all
agencies
of
government
government-sanctioned
torture
a
press
that
reflects
the
ideology
of
one
and
only
one
side
and
our
country
committing
wars
of
aggression
When
do
they
start
on
us
Go
read
the
report
at
The
Stakeholder
And
watch
your
backs

Priorities
Rolling
Stone
via
A
review
of
fines
levied
by
other
federal
agencies
suggests
that
the
government
may
be
taking
swear
words
a
bit
too
seriously
If
the
bill
passes
the
Senate
Bono
saying
fucking
brilliant
on
the
air
would
carry
the
exact
same
penalty
as
illegally
testing
pesticides
on
human
subjects
And
for
the
price
of
Janet
Jackson's
wardrobe
malfunction
during
the
Super
Bowl
you
could
cause
the
wrongful
death
of
an
elderly
patient
in
a
nursing
home
and
still
have
enough
money
left
to
create
dangerous
mishaps
at
two
nuclear
reactors
Actually
you
might
be
able
to
afford
four
nuke
malfunctions
The
biggest
fine
levied
by
the
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
last
year
was
only
60,000
