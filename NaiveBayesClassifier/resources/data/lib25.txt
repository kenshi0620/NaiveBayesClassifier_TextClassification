Getting
Idaho
out
of
the
1970s
by

Here's
a
fun
fact
about
Republican
candidate
for
Senate
in
Idaho
Jim
Risch
He's
either
really
really
bad
at
math
or
a
liar
Jim
Risch
Republican
The
focus
has
been
on
the
17
percent
of
the
people
who
do
not
have
insurance
It's
important
to
note
that
83
percent
of
Americans
do
have
insurance
they've
either
gone
and
bought
it
themselves
or
they've
negotiated
with
their
employer
for
it
or
they've
simply
looked
for
a
job
where
they
get
health
insurance
as
a
benefit
In
an
interview
Risch
insisted
that
83
percent
of
Americans
have
private
insurance
and
the
remainder
are
covered
by
Medicare
Medicaid
or
emergency
rooms
When
a
reporter
suggested
that
his
figure
included
those
on
Medicare
and
Medicaid
Risch
said
No
you're
wrong
That
is
private
insurance
And
that's
surprising
isn't
it
I
supposed
we
can't
rule
out
the
possibility
that
he's
both
really
really
bad
at
math
and
a
liar
Or
it
could
be
that
2008
just
hasn't
caught
up
with
him
yet
The
reporter
working
this
story
actually
does
the
math
for
him
However
the
U.S
Census
reports
that
just
67.5
percent
of
Americans
were
covered
by
private
health
insurance
in
2007
including
the
59.3
percent
covered
by
employer-based
insurance
The
Census
reported
that
15.3
percent
of
Americans
about
45.7
million
people
had
no
health
coverage
in
2007
which
means
84.7
percent
had
coverage
of
some
type
including
Medicare
and
Medicaid
Risch
said
The
83
percent
have
grown
up
in
a
free
market
system
that
includes
free
choice
by
people
and
I'm
not
one
that
is
going
to
use
the
excuse
that
17
percent
are
uninsured
to
throw
out
the
current
system
for
the
83
percent
He
added
I'm
not
going
to
go
to
a
single-payer
system
period
I
am
not
going
to
go
to
a
system
where
the
government
takes
over
your
health
insurance
or
your
health
care
I'm
not
going
there
Because
I
think
that
people
can
do
better
for
themselves
at
almost
anything
than
the
federal
government
can
do
for
them
Contrast
that
with
Democrat
Larry
LaRocco
who
held
a
special
forum
in
Boise
today
with
Sen
Ron
Wyden
specifically
on
the
subject
of
the
need
for
health
care
reform
Larry
LaRocco
Democrat
I
believe
that
this
is
the
next
economic
crisis
that
we're
going
to
face
in
our
country
because
the
cost
of
health
care
is
outstripping
inflation
So
I
have
a
plan
and
I've
thought
it
through
I
think
it's
a
fairly
detailed
plan
I
will
fight
for
it
but
I
will
work
with
anybody
in
the
Senate
Democrat
or
Republican
who
wants
to
improve
the
system
and
move
toward
universal
health
care
and
build
an
American-based
system
that's
affordable
in
quality
The
prescriptions
for
my
plan
are
to
eliminate
pre-existing
conditions
to
have
portability
of
our
health
care
plan
so
you
can
take
it
from
job
to
job
to
focus
on
prevention
Also
so
that
you
as
an
individual
if
you're
out
of
work
you
can
deduct
your
premiums
from
your
taxes
And
it
also
focuses
on
medical
records
and
it
focuses
in
here
on
the
underserved
areas
of
Idaho
that
need
doctors
and
they
need
nurses
This
is
the
way
that
we're
going
to
tackle
this
LaRocco's
detailed
plan
is
posted
on
his
Web
site
Risch
has
a
Web
site
surprisingly
Here's
his
health
care
plan
Yeah
it's
a
little
um
thin
He
does
however
talk
about
the
importance
of
healthy
marriages
and
strong
families
in
Idaho
LaRocco
recognizes
the
scope
of
the
problem
and
actually
brought
Sen
Ron
Wyden
to
Boise
today
for
a
90
minute
forum
with
leaders
in
the
state's
business
and
health
care
communities
along
with
state
and
local
government
representatives
It
was
one
of
the
most
substantive
discussions
I've
seen
this
election
season
and
it
was
proof
that
while
Jim
Risch
might
still
be
living
in
the
1970s
the
people
that
have
to
try
to
provide
health
care
to
Idaho's
citizens
are
dealing
with
all
the
ugly
realities
of
2008
including
an
awful
lot
of
uninsured
people
There's
no
question
who
would
serve
Idaho
better
and
who
would
be
a
better
ally
for
Barack
Obama
and
a
Democratic
majority
in
Congress
in
trying
to
achieve
significant
health
care
reform
That
would
be
the
guy
who
recognizes
not
only
that
we've
got
a
serious
problem
but
the
scope
of
it
Update
LaRocco

on

Universal
Registration
by

Fri
Oct
31
2008
at
07:30:03
AM
PDT
Last
week
the
always
insightful
Rick
Hasen
of
the
Election
Law
blog
penned
a
piece
in
Salon
regarding
the
need
for
a
simplified
fair
and
universal
voter
registration
system
The
entire
piece
is
a
must
read
but
this
part
was
particularly
pragmatic
and
it
reiterates
ideas
that
many
of
us
in
the
election
reform
community
have
been
advocating
for
a
while
The
solution
is
to
take
the
job
of
voter
registration
for
federal
elections
out
of
the
hands
of
third
parties
and
out
of
the
hands
of
the
counties
and
states
and
give
it
to
the
federal
government
The
Constitution
grants
Congress
wide
authority
over
congressional
elections
The
next
president
should
propose
legislation
to
have
the
Census
Bureau
when
it
conducts
the
2010
census
also
register
all
eligible
voters
who
wish
to
be
registered
for
future
federal
elections
High-school
seniors
could
be
signed
up
as
well
so
that
they
would
be
registered
to
vote
on
their
18th
birthday
When
people
submit
change-of-address
cards
to
the
post
office
election
officials
would
also
change
their
registration
information
This
change
would
eliminate
most
voter
registration
fraud
Government
employees
would
not
have
an
incentive
to
pad
registration
lists
with
additional
people
in
order
to
keep
their
jobs
The
system
would
also
eliminate
the
need
for
matches
between
state
databases
a
problem
that
has
proved
so
troublesome
because
of
the
bad
quality
of
the
data
The
federal
government
could
assign
each
person
a
unique
voter-identification
number
which
would
remain
the
same
regardless
of
where
the
voter
moves
The
unique
ID
would
prevent
people
from
voting
in
two
jurisdictions
such
as
snowbirds
who
might
be
tempted
to
vote
in
Florida
and
New
York
States
would
not
have
to
use
the
system
for
their
state
and
local
elections
but
most
would
choose
to
do
so
because
of
the
cost
savings
In
the
Atlanta-Journal
Constitution
Rob
Richie
and
Adam
Fogel
of
FairVote
make
a
similar
point
emphasis
added
Blaming
ACORN
for
our
voter
registration
system
is
a
classic
failure
of
missing
the
forest
for
the
trees
Amidst
accusations
of
ACORN
putting
our
democracy
in
jeopardy
few
are
asking
why
private
groups
are
even
in
the
business
of
voter
registration
drives
The
answer
is
that
the
United
States
is
one
of
the
few
democracies
where
the
federal
government
doesn't
assume
responsibility
for
establishing
full
and
accurate
voter
rolls
and
it
just
isn't
working
Nearly
a
third
of
eligible
voters
aren't
registered
to
vote
and
our
turnout
rates
are
among
the
lowest
in
the
world
The
problem
is
our
opt-in
self-initiated
voter
registration
system
Right
now
the
onus
is
on
citizens
to
update
their
information
ensure
correct
spelling
and
cancel
old
registrations
when
they
move
Implementing
a
few
common
sense
reforms
would
go
a
long
way
in
solving
our
voter
registration
problems
and
lessen
the
necessity
of
groups
seeking
to
register
so
many
new
voters
every
four
years
One
example
is
seeking
to
register
every
citizen
before
they
reach
voting
age
by
following
the
lead
of
Hawaii
and
Florida
in
allowing
16-year-olds
to
register
to
vote
with
their
names
automatically
added
to
the
voter
rolls
when
they
reach
18
This
change
would
ideally
be
twinned
with
systematic
registration
of
young
people
in
high
schools
and
at
driver's
license
agencies
and
voter's
ed
classes
on
the
mechanics
of
participation
in
communities
Other
sensible
proposals
include
Election
Day
registration
and
moving
to
making
voter
registration
permanent
through
automatic
updates
of
registration
with
changes
of
address
More
broadly
it's
time
for
the
government
to
take
on
the
responsibility
of
establishing
full
and
accurate
voter
rolls
This
goal
is
not
rocket
science
it's
the
international
norm
and
the
very
best
way
to
prevent
voter
registration
fraud
and
our
low
rates
of
voter
registration
This
is
the
supreme
blowback
resulting
from
the
GOP's
ACORN
smear
By
so
vigorously
highlighting
the
very
real
problems
with
third-party
registration
model
the
GOP
has
unwittingly
provided
the
best
argument
in
favor
of
having
the
government
step
in
and
facilitate
a
universal
registration
system
And
so
the
irony
is
that
in
trying
to
suppress
voter
turnout
by
calling
even
valid
registrations
into
question
Republicans
have
opened
the
door
to
a
long-overdue
discussion
on
how
best
to
reform
our
inherently
flawed
voter
registration
system
in
order
to
ensure
that
every
American
who
has
the
right
to
vote
may
do
so
without
redtape
barriers
Universal
registration
is
one
of
the
top
items
on
what
we're
can
call
a
Voter's
Bill
of
Rights
that
should
be
embraced
by
Congress
after
the
election
more
on
this
in
the
weeks
to
follow
but
it
would
include
among
other
things
ballot
simplification
auditable
paper
trails
etc

From
CBS/NY
Times
All
told
59
percent
of
voters
surveyed
said
that
Ms
Palin
was
not
prepared
for
the
job
up
9
percentage
points
since
the
beginning
of
the
month
Nearly
a
third
of
voters
polled
said
that
the
vice-presidential
selection
would
be
a
major
factor
influencing
their
vote
for
president
and
those
voters
broadly
favored
Senator
Barack
Obama
In
a
possible
indication
that
the
choice
of
Ms
Palin
has
hurt
Mr
McCain's
image
voters
said
that
they
had
much
more
confidence
in
Mr
Obama
to
pick
qualified
people
to
serve
in
his
administration
than
they
did
in
Mr
McCain
and
The
survey
found
that
opinions
of
Mr
Obama
and
Mr
McCain
have
hardened
considerably
as
9
in
10
voters
who
said
that
they
had
settled
on
a
candidate
indicated
that
their
minds
were
made
up
a
growing
number
of
them
called
it
extremely
important
that
their
candidate
win
the
election
on
Tuesday
About
half
of
each
of
the
candidate's
supporters
said
that
they
were
scared
of
what
the
other
candidate
would
do
if
elected
Just
4
percent
of
voters
were
undecided
and
when
they
were
pressed
to
say
whom
they
were
leaning
toward
the
shape
of
the
race
remained
essentially
the
same
and
Mr
McCain's
renewed
efforts
to
recast
himself
as
the
candidate
of
change
he
and
Ms
Palin
sometimes
refer
to
themselves
as
a
couple
of
mavericks
have
apparently
faltered
Sixty-four
percent
of
voters
polled
said
that
Mr
Obama
would
bring
about
real
change
if
elected
while
only
39
percent
said
that
Mr
McCain
would
And
despite
Mr
McCain's
increased
efforts
to
distance
himself
from
President
Bush
a
majority
still
said
that
he
would
generally
continue
President
Bush's
policies
Not
good
for
Palin-McCain

A
Diageo/Hotline
poll
conducted
among
800
Hispanic
voters
in
Colorado
Nevada
and
New
Mexico
finds
that
Barack
Obama
leads
John
McCain
among
Hispanic
voters
in
the
race
for
the
Presidency
by
a
43-point
margin
with
6
of
voters
saying
they
are
undecided
Worse
Amy
Walter
Editor-in-Chief
of
the
Hotline
commented
That
McCain
is
unfavorably
viewed
by
an
overwhelming
majority
of
Hispanics
in
the
Southwest
is
bad
news
for
his
election
chances
in
this
fast
growing
part
of
the
country
But
the
worst
part
for
the
GOP
is
that
the
party
as
a
whole
is
seen
unfavorably
by
these
voters
This
is
Obama's
firewall
and
these
numbers
show
you
why
Those
are
19
EVs
that
used
to
belong
to
the
GOP
More
on
the
undecideds
from
Mark
Blumenthal
Charles
Franklin's
finding
The
model
predicts
that
the
totally
undecided
voters
in
this
sample
will
split
54
percent
for
Obama
and
46
percent
for
McCain
more
details
on
Franklin's
model
here
Of
course
this
result
is
far
from
the
final
word
on
this
subject
The
pollsters
at
Gallup
ABC/Washington
Post
Research2000
Rasmussen
Reports
and
three
other
organizations
have
been
collecting
similarly
large
pools

This
is
it
The
last
day
And
if
you
want
one
final
bit
of
motivation
to
get
Bob
Lord
to
our
100,000
goal
12,000
to
go
the
conservative
Arizona
Republic
has
offered
it
There
is
little
doubt
that
Democrats
generally
will
do
well
Tuesday
And
if
District
3
voters
are
dissatisfied
with
Shadegg's
conservative
politics
Lord
may
join
a
large
freshman
class
of
Democrats
But
local
voter
dissatisfaction
is
one
thing
What
Moulitsas
seeks
has
the
unseemly
scent
of
wild-eyed
vengeance
The
fellow
is
looking
for
GOP
bodies
over
which
to
stand
The
Arizona
Republic
has
urged
District
3
voters
to
re-elect
Shadegg
As
Kos
himself
notes
Shadegg
is
the
topmost
conservative
in
the
House
But
now
we
add
another
reason
to
support
the
incumbent
Politics
isn't
or
shouldn't
be
blood
sport
Re-elect
John
Shadegg
and
give
an
out-of-state
political
barbarian
something
to
weep
about
on
Election
Day
Phoenix's
top
newspaper
is
apparently
run
by
wingnut
bloggers
and
like
wingnut
bloggers
they
live
in
mortal
fear
of
losing
Shadegg's
extremist
right-wing
conservatism
from
Congress
Of
course
the
Republic
is
already
weeping
Arizona
has
gone
from
a
6-2
Republican
delegation
in
the
U.S
House
to
4-4
last
cycle
and
will
lose
at
least
one
seat
this
year
the
open
AZ-01
seat
The
newspaper
is
increasingly
out
of
touch
with
its
readers
witness
its
wholehearted
endorsement
of
McCain
while
their
state
flirts
with
abandoning
their
native
son
for
Obama
The
thought
of
the
wingnutosphere
wailing
at
Shadegg's
loss
was
delicious
enough
The
Arizona
Republican
has
just
upped
the
ante
I
want
to
see
those
wingnuts
crying
as
well
If
Shadegg
survives
we'll
have
plenty
to
celebrate
regardless
This
is
a
tough
Republican
district
with
a
well-funded
entrenched
incumbent
Our
odds
have
always
been
tough
so
we're
targeting
it
as
a
cherry
on
top
For
conservatives
however
keeping
this
seat
would
be
about
the
only
bright
spot
of
what
will
be
a
brutal
night
If
we
take
this
one
away
from
them
a
bad
night
will
become
hellish
and
spirits
will
be
crushed
So
let's
close
strong
for
Bob
Lord
Gary
Trauner
10,000
or
so
to
go
on
that
goal
and
the
rest
of
the
great
candidates
and
causes

The
time
for
procrastination
is

A

Jane
Hamsher
at
Firedoglake
Gort
has
been
abducted
multiply
replicated
and
is
now
being
abused
by
the
McCain
campaign
team
in
its
final
desperate
effort
to
add
four
more
years
to
the
Cheney-Bush
catastrophe
We've
got
only
one
day
left
to
raise
money
and
only
four
more
days
to
knock
on
doors
make
phone
calls
and
boost
voter
turnout
to
a
48-year
record
The
turnout
of
the
voting-age
population
was
63.1
in
1960
In
2004
it
was
55.3
The
low
point
was
49.1
in
1996
The
Field
Poll
released
in
California
Thursday
indicated
that
Barack
Obama
is
poised
to
win
California
by
the
largest
margin
of
any
president
since
Franklin
D
Roosevelt
in
1936
The
Democratic
presidential
candidate
leads
Republican
rival
John
McCain
by
22
percentage
points
55-33
among
likely
voters
in
California
If
that
margin
holds
Tuesday
he
would
set
a
post-World
War
II
record
for
a
presidential
victor
in
the
state
Not
even
landslide
victories
in
1980
and
1984
by
Ronald
Reagan
a
former
California
governor
came
close
The
Field
Poll
found
that
helping
drive
the
momentum
for
Obama
are
independents
who
are
expected
make
up
one-in-four
voters
this
election
An
astounding
two-thirds
of
decline-to-state
voters
back
Obama
compared
with
just
16
percent
for
McCain
Closely
contested
ballot
propositions
notably
Proposition
8
which
would
ban
gay
marriages
could
be
affected
Recent
polls
show
Democrats
are
heavily
opposed
to
Proposition
8
but
not
in
numbers
as
large
as
their
support
for
Obama
More
than
two-thirds
of
Republicans
support
the
ban
suggesting
party
affiliation
is
a
key
determinant
But
DiCamillo
said
only
about
one-third
of
the
electorate
is
expected
to
be
Republican
Opponents
of
the
measure
are
counting
on
a
large
youth
voter
turnout
to
defeat
it

supporters
of

Wow
Audience
members
escorted
out
of
Sen
John
McCain's
R-Ariz
campaign
event
in
Cedar
Falls
questioned
why
they
were
asked
to
leave
Sunday's
rally
even
though
they
were
not
protesting
David
Zarifis
director
of
public
safety
for
the
University
of
Northern
Iowa
said
McCain
staffers
requested
UNI
police
assist
in
escorting
out
about
four
or
five
people
from
the
rally
prior
to
McCain's
speech
When
I
started
talking
to
them
it
kind
of
became
clear
that
they
were
kind
of
just

John
McCain
and
Sarah
Palin
have
based
their
entire
campaign
on
a
series
of
nasty
false
personal
attacks
on
Barack
Obama
Their
bet
has
been
that
Americans
are
a
fearful
frightened
bunch
who
won't
be
willing
to
vote
for
a
new
direction
But
the
McCain-Palin
calculus
couldn't
have
been
more
wrong
their
bet
is
going
to
fail
and
fail
badly
When
it
does
fail
it
will
leave
the
Republican
Party
with
nothing
John
McCain
will
almost
certainly
outperform
Barry
Goldwater
in
this
election
in
terms
of
his
share
of
the
vote
yet
he
will
leave
his
party
in
far
worse
shape
than
did
Goldwater
At
least
Goldwater
left
his
party
with
a
devoted
base
of
conservative
activists
energized
by
his
commitment
to
conservative
ideology
McCain
meanwhile
has
stood
for
nothing
other
than
attacks
on
Barack
Obama
He
has
taken
a
Republican
brand
that
had
been
shattered
by
George
W
Bush
and
done
nothing
to
repair
it
leaving
his
party
with
no
more
of
a
clue
about
how
to
address
the
needs
of
ordinary
Americans
than
they
had
when
this
election
cycle
began
The
fact
that
almost
nobody
in
McCain's
party
seems
to
understand
the
devastating
consequences
of
this
failure
is
a
strong
indication
that
Republicans
will
be
stuck
in
the
political
wilderness
for
many
years
to
come

NC-Sen
Following
Elizabeth
Dole's
horrendous
Godless
ad
Kay
Hagan
has
a
rapid
response
on
the
air
That's
a
hell
of
an
ad
Two
polls
released
today
show
Hagan
leading
Rasmussen
and
National
Journal
one
shows
her
trailing
by
four
That
one
is
the
venerable
Mason-Dixon...but
their
results
are
far
out
of
line
with
all
other
recent
NC
polls
and
their
most
recent
result
from
another
race
Chambliss/Martin
in
Georgia
also
shows
a
big
Republican
lead
out
of
line
with
other
polling
So
feel
free
to
take
with
salt
KY-Sen
Bruce
Lunsford
has
a
new
one
on
the
air
as
well
with
a
familiar
politician
starring
in
it
Swing
State
Project's
James
L
calls
it
an
extraordinary
sign
of
the
times
that
Hillary
Clinton
is
now
considered
a
political
star
in
a
red
state
like
Kentucky
I'm
inclined
to
agree
Meanwhile
internal
polling
has
the
race
at
47
for
McConnell
45
for
Lunsford
FL-25
Here's
a
terrific
video
from
Joe
Garcia's
campaign
Garcia
and
Annette
Taddeo
held
an
event
with
several
veterans
on
Monday
with
Rep
Silvestre
Reyes
a
decorated
Vietnam
veteran
and
several
other
veterans
at
which
Fuller
Haring
spoke
Naturally
the
best
response
of
the
Diaz-Balart
camp
was
to
call
this
a
desperate
gimmick
which
merely
serves
to
underscore
Mario
Diaz-Balart's
underlying
disdain
for
the
service
of
Haring
and
other
veterans
VA-02
Mark
Warner
cuts
an
ad...for
Glenn
Nye
OH-02
Jean
Schmidt
says
she'll
run
a
positive
campaign...and
lies
through
her
damned
teeth
Needless
to
say
the
ad
is
composed
of
also-lies
On
October
29
Schmidt
launches
most
baseless
ad
yet
falsely
maligning
Wulsin's
medical
career
These
false
allegations
were
thoroughly
reviewed
by
the
State
Medical
Board
of
Ohio
a
non-partisan
panel
of
experts
who
determined
that
the
allegations
have
no
merit
and
required
no
further
action
The
Cincinnati
Enquirer
described
Schmidt's
charges
as
stretching
the
truth

Plumber

op
earlier
this

According
to
the

Joe

but
according
to
Joe
they
never
followed
up
with
him
after
making

Either
way
it
led
to
one
of

moments
of

who
announced
Joe's

only
to
quickly
discover
that

was

Listening
to
the
Locals
Georgia
by

Thu
Oct

05:26:47
PM
PDT
In
the
final
days
of
an
election
there
is
so
much
information
from
so
many
races
it's
difficult
to
stay
on
top
of
every
story
and
understand
the
subtle
dynamics
often
at
play
on
the
ground
Thankfully
we
have
an
expansive
50-state
blogosphere
to
match
our
50-state
strategy
Over
the
last
two
weeks
of
the
campaign
we've
asked
leaders
of
the
state
blogospheres
to
provide
insight
into
late
developments
and
share
the
stories
of
their
states
in
a
series
we're
calling
Listening
to
the
Locals
SusanG
Pain
is
inevitable
Suffering
is
optional
Kathleen
Casey
As
a
Georgia
Democrat
I
recall
that
reality
all
to
clearly
on
Nov
8th
2006
While
most
of
the
country
was
riding
the
wave
of
Democratic
resurgence
in
the
Congress
Georgia
had
re-elected
the
first
Republican
Governor
since
Reconstruction
and
Republicans
easily
rolled
up
the
Lt
Governorship
It
was
a
bitter
crescendo
to
a
creeping
sting
of
losses
An
ending
to
a
gradual
decline
in
the
electoral
success
of
the
once
dominate
Democratic
Party
of
Georgia
The
question
was
not
one
of
pain
it
was
of
the
scope
of
suffering
to
come
Just
how
long
would
it
take
for
our
state
party
to
turn
around
at
precisely
the
time
that
our
national
party
was
busy
building
a
new
majority
My
name
is
Jon
Flack
and
I
write
as
flackattack
at
the
Georgia
progressive
blog
Tondee's
Tavern
The
national
media
and
blogoshere
has
unexpectedly
showered
attention
on
Georgia
lately
and
yeah
we
were
a
bit
caught
by
surprise
ourselves
I've
come
to
think
about
this
years
election
as
an
accelerating
event
to
the
plans
laid
down
after
our
06
loses
Georgia
exemplifies
in
practice
the
convergence
of
a
state
party
focused
on
it's
own
159
county
strategy
and
a
presidential
campaign
committed
to
a
50
state
one
Add
to
the
mix
an
economic
factor
and
what
you
have
is
a
state
that
might
just
pull
off
a
few
surprises
on
the
4th
The
Fundamentals
Of
Our
Party
Are
Strong
After
the
2006
elections
our
state
party
also
held
an
election
to
chose
the
next
state
chair
With
the
election
of
Jane
V
Kidd
the
DPG
set
in
motion
a
plan
to
grow
the
party
in
the
field
It
has
harvested
some
pretty
impressive
results
Note
that
this
kind
of
159
county
strategy
was
in
motion
before
Campaign
for
Change
came
to
town
Consider
The
state
party
has
run
a
fulltime
canvass
since
last
August
and
a
call
center
since
February
At
this
time
in
2007
the
DPG
had
18,000
IDs
in
the
voter
file
Today
they
have
over
1
million
At
the
beginning
of
2008
the
DPG
invested
for
the
first
time
in
field
offices
When
you
start
to
ponder
the
place
we
find
ourselves
in
today
it's
hard
to
argue
that
the
re-building
of
the
party
infrastructure
coupled
with
the
rapid
intensification
of
early
investment
by
the
Obama
campaign
has
enhanced
our
capacity
to
be
competitive
Whether
or
not
we
all
get
an
early
nights
sleep
with
a
predictive
victory
in
Georgia
this
election
has
boosted
the
efforts
to
create
a
lasting
ability
to
run
and
win
as
Democrats
all
across
the
Peach
State
The
Early
Voting
Avalanche
There
have
been
countless
mentions
of
the
early
vote
here
on
kos
and
in
the
media
generally
Yes
the
polls
are
filled
and
the
lines
are
long
and
yes
MisHandle
is
responsible
for
making
it
worse
African
American
turnout
has
been
and
continues
to
be
very
impressive
Here
is
a
little
peek
under
the
covers
of
more
goodness
beyond
the
top-line
numbers
released
by
the

strong
against

by

the

and
the
recently

Freedom's

Personally
I
share
the
view
that
we
are
looking
at
a
early
December
run-off
for
a
filibuster
proof
majority
in
the
Senate
Hang
in
to
your
hats
folks
This
one
has
legs
Make
no
mistake
Chambliss
and
his
crew
are
worried
In
my
neck
of
the
woods
Forsyth
County
just
yesterday
the
always
classy
Chambliss
had
this
to
say
The
Republican
is
outwardly
confident
but
there's
urgency
in
his
voice
as
he
tours
North
Georgia
trying
to
boost
turnout
in
his
predominately
white
base
The
other
folks
are
voting
he
bluntly
tells
supporters
Take
that
in
as
you
like
Below
the
radar
sits
a
couple
of
races
that
are
particularly
interesting
Both
races
are
hard
fought
battles
with
Democratic
challengers
with
little
resources
They
represent
the
kind
of
fighting
spirit
we
are
seeing
from
candidates
across
the
state
The
most
surprising
and
refreshing
is
PSC
candidate
Jim
Powell
Powell
won
his
primary
with
over
80
of
the
vote
after
Secretary
of
State
MisHandel
threw
Powell
from
the
ballot
over
a
bogus
residence
challenge
um
I
see
a
pattern
here
Powell
sued
was
reinstated
and
continues
to
fight
on
in
the
face
of
a
still
unresolved
case
that
sits
before
the
state
supreme
court
All
that
to
face
Lauren
Buba
McDonald
a
party
switcher
and
former
shill
for
energy
companies
PSC
commissioner
whose
has
come
back
for
another
bite
of

after

failed
run
for
state
Senate
Bill
Gillespie
in

has
the
unenviable
task
of
running
against
Rep
Jack
Slappy
Kingston
Bill
is
the
real
deal
and
is
perhaps
the
strongest
Democratic
challenger
the
1st
has
seen
in
decades
This
is
what
the
Savannah
Daily
News
had
to
say
Frankly
Jack
began
to
lose
our
support
last
Feb
27
when
he
appeared
on
the
Dan
Abrams
show
and
said
it
was
okay
to
question
Sen
Barack
Obama's
patriotism
because
he
doesn't
regularly
wear
an
American
flag
lapel
pin
Yet
he
continues
to
use
such
tactics
seeking
to
smear
his
opponent
Bill
Gillespie
in
this
race
accusing
him
of
lying
about
his
educational
degrees
and
other
achievements
despite
two
news
organizations
having
confirmed
that
Gillespie's
resum
is
accurate
Savannahian
Bill
Gillespie
is
a
highly
educated
fiscally
conservative
Democrat
a
war
hero
of
the
Iraq
War
a
recipient
of
the
Bronze
Star
and
a
candidate
with
a
vision
of
how
to
bring
jobs
back
to
the
1st
District
in
manufacturing
alternative
energy
and
the
timber
industry
Whatever
happens
in
Georgia
on
election
night
the
energy
and
hard
work
of
thousands
will
live
on
in
a
re-born
party
looking
at
long
term
success
Thanks
