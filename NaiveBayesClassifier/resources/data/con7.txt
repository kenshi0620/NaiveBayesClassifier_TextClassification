Obama
and
the
Politics
of
Crowds
The
masses
greeting
the
candidate
on
the
trail
are
a
sign
of
great
unease
By
FOUAD
AJAMI
There
is
something
odd
and
dare
I
say
novel
in
American
politics
about
the
crowds
that
have
been
greeting
Barack
Obama
on
his
campaign
trail
Hitherto
crowds
have
not
been
a
prominent
feature
of
American
politics
We
associate
them
with
the
temper
of
Third
World
societies
We
think
of
places
like
Argentina
and
Egypt
and
Iran
of
multitudes
brought
together
by
their
zeal
for
a
Peron
or
a
Nasser
or
a
Khomeini
In
these
kinds
of
societies
the
crowd
comes
forth
to
affirm
its
faith
in
a
redeemer
a
man
who
would
set
the
world
right
Martin
Kozlowski
As
the
late
Nobel
laureate
Elias
Canetti
observes
in
his
great
book
Crowds
and
Power
first
published
in
1960
the
crowd
is
based
on
an
illusion
of
equality
Its
quest
is
for
that
moment
when
distinctions
are
thrown
off
and
all
become
equal
It
is
for
the
sake
of
this
blessed
moment
when
no
one
is
greater
or
better
than
another
that
people
become
a
crowd
These
crowds
in
the
tens
of
thousands
who
have
been
turning
out
for
the
Democratic
standard-bearer
in
St
Louis
and
Denver
and
Portland
are
a
measure
of
American
distress
On
the
face
of
it
there
is
nothing
overwhelmingly
stirring
about
Sen
Obama
There
is
a
cerebral
quality
to
him
and
an
air
of
detachment
He
has
eloquence
but
within
bounds
After
nearly
two
years
on
the
trail
the
audience
can
pretty
much
anticipate
and
recite
his
lines
The
political
genius
of
the
man
is
that
he
is
a
blank
slate
The
devotees
can
project
onto
him
what
they
wish
The
coalition
that
has
propelled
his
quest
African-Americans
and
affluent
white
liberals
has
no
economic
coherence
But
for
the
moment
there
is
the
illusion
of
a
common
undertaking
Canetti's
feeling
of
equality
within
the
crowd
The
day
after
the
crowd
will
of
course
discover
its
own
fissures
The
affluent
will
have
to
pay
for
the
programs
promised
the
poor
The
redistribution
agenda
that
runs
through
Mr
Obama's
vision
is
anathema
to
the
Silicon
Valley
entrepreneurs
and
the
hedge-fund
managers
now
smitten
with
him
Their
ethos
is
one
of
competition
and
the
justice
of
the
rewards
that
come
with
risk
and
effort
All
this
is
shelved
as
the
devotees
sustain
the
candidacy
of
a
man
whose
public
career
has
been
a
steady
advocacy
of
reining
in
the
market
and
organizing
those
who
believe
in
entitlement
and
redistribution
A
creature
of
universities
and
churches
and
nonprofit
institutions
the
Illinois
senator
with
the
blessing
and
acquiescence
of
his
upscale
supporters
has
glided
past
these
hard
distinctions
On
the
face
of
it
it
must
be
surmised
that
his
affluent
devotees
are
ready
to
foot
the
bill
for
the
new
order
or
are
convinced
that
after
victory
the
old
ways
will
endure
and
that
Mr
Obama
will
govern
from
the
center
Ambiguity
has
been
a
powerful
weapon
of
this
gifted
candidate
He
has
been
different
things
to
different
people
and
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
tell
this
coalition
of
a
thousand
discontents
and
a
thousand
visions
the
details
of
his
political
programs
redistribution
for
the
poor
postracial
absolution
and
modernity
for
the
upper
end
of
the
scale
It
was
no
accident
that
the
white
working
class
was
the
last
segment
of
the
population
to
sign
up
for
the
Obama
journey
Their
hesitancy
was
not
about
race
They
were
men
and
women
of
practicality
they
distrusted
oratory
they
could
see
through
the
falseness
of
the
solidarity
offered
by
this
campaign
They
did
not
have
much
but
believed
in
the
legitimacy
of
what
little
they
had
acquired
They
valued
work
and
its
rewards
They
knew
and
heard
of
staggering
wealth
made
by
the
Masters
of
the
Universe
but
held
onto
their
faith
in
the
outcomes
that
economic
life
decreed
The
economic
hurricane
that
struck
America
some
weeks
ago
shook
them
to
the
core
They
now
seek
protection
the
shelter
of
the
state
and
the
promise
of
social
repair
The
bonuses
of
the
wizards
who
ran
the
great
corporate
entities
had
not
bothered
them
It
was
the
spectacle
of
the
work
of
the
wizards
melting
before
our
eyes
that
unsettled
them
Daniel
Patrick
Moynihan
the
late
Democratic
senator
from
New
York
once
set
the
difference
between
American
capitalism
and
the
older
European
version
by
observing
that
America
was
the
party
of
liberty
whereas
Europe
was
the
party
of
equality
Just
in
the
nick
of
time
for
the
Obama
candidacy
the
American
faith
in
liberty
began
to
crack
The
preachers
of
America's
decline
in
the
global
pecking
order
had
added
to
the
panic
Our
best
days
were
behind
us
the
declinists
prophesied
The
sun
was
setting
on
our
imperium
and
rising
in
other
lands
A
younger
man
cool
and
collected
carrying
within
his
own
biography
the
strands
of
the
world
beyond
America's
shores
was
put
forth
as
a
herald
of
the
change
upon
us
The
crowd
would
risk
the
experiment
There
was
grudge
and
a
desire
for
retribution
in
the
crowd
to
begin
with
Akin
to
the
passions
that
have
shaped
and
driven
highly
polarized
societies
this
election
has
at
its
core
a
desire
to
settle
the
unfinished
account
of
the
presidential
election
eight
years
ago
George
W
Bush's
presidency
remained
for
his
countless
critics
and
detractors
a
tale
of
usurpation
He
had
gotten
what
was
not
his
due
more
galling
still
he
had
been
bold
and
unabashed
and
taken
his
time
at
the
helm
as
an
opportunity
to
assert
an
ambitious
doctrine
of
American
power
abroad
He
had
waged
a
war
of
choice
in
Iraq
This
election
is
the
rematch
that
John
Kerry
had
not
delivered
on
In
the
fashion
of
the
crowd
that
seeks
and
sees
the
justice
of
retribution
Mr
Obama's
supporters
have
been
willing
to
overlook
his
means
So
a
candidate
pledged
to
good
government
and
to
ending
the
role
of
money
in
our
political
life
opts
out
of
public
financing
of
presidential
campaigns
What
of
it
The
end
justifies
the
means
Save
in
times
of
national
peril
Americans
have
been
sober
really
minimalist
in
what
they
expected
out
of
national
elections
out
of
politics
itself
The
outcomes
that
mattered
were
decided
in
the
push
and
pull
of
daily
life
by
the
inventors
and
the
entrepreneurs
and
the
captains
of
industry
and
finance
To
be
sure
there
was
a
measure
of
willfulness
in
this
national
vision
for
politics
and
wars
guided
the
destiny
of
this
republic
But
that
American
sobriety
and
skepticism
about
politics
and
leaders
set
this
republic
apart
from
political
cultures
that
saw
redemption
lurking
around
every
corner
My
boyhood
and
the
Arab
political
culture
I
have
been
chronicling
for
well
over
three
decades
are
anchored
in
the
Arab
world
And
the
tragedy
of
Arab
political
culture
has
been
the
unending
expectation
of
the
crowd
the
street
we
call
it
in
the
redeemer
who
will
put
an
end
to
the
decline
who
will
restore
faded
splendor
and
greatness
When
I
came
into
my
own
in
the
late
1950s
and
60s
those
hopes
were
invested
in
the
Egyptian
Gamal
Abdul
Nasser
He
faltered
and
broke
the
hearts
of
generations
of
Arabs
But
the
faith
in
the
Awaited
One
lives
on
and
it
would
forever
circle
the
Arab
world
looking
for
the
next
redeemer
America
is
a
different
land
for
me
exceptional
in
all
the
ways
that
matter
In
recent
days
those
vast
Obama
crowds
though
have
recalled
for
me
the
politics
of
charisma
that
wrecked
Arab
and
Muslim
societies
A
leader
does
not
have
to
say
much
or
be
much
The
crowd
is
left
to
its
most
powerful
possession
its
imagination
From
Elias
Canetti
again
But
the
crowd
as
such
disintegrates
It
has
a
presentiment
of
this
and
fears
it
Only
the
growth
of
the
crowd
prevents
those
who
belong
to
it
from
creeping
back
under
their
private
burdens
The
morning
after
the
election
the
disappointment
will
begin
to
settle
upon
the
Obama
crowd
Defeat
by
now
unthinkable
to
the
devotees
will
bring
heartbreak
Victory
will
steadily
deliver
the
sobering
verdict
that
our
troubles
won't
be
solved
by
a
leader's
magic

in

fear
for

Speeding
puppet
in
the
front

a
British
car
makes
muppets
of
the
German
police
By
Allan
Hall
German
police
are
appealing
for
help
in
finding
a
British
driver
making
muppets
out
of
them
Speed
cameras
in
the
state
of
Bavaria
have
captured
an
Audi
car
breaking
the
speed
limit
several
times
with
a
Muppet
Show
character
appearing
to
be
at
the
wheel
Only
after
examining

camera
photos
more
closely
did
they
realise
it
was

car
with

plates
A

camera
captures
the
driver
dressed
as
Animal
from
The

Only
a
blur
was
captured
in
the
driving
seat
because
the

are

The
puppet
in
question
is
Animal
the

Show's

Dr

and
The

German
police
have
logged
the

of

with
its

registration
bureau
for
fines
but
as
the
car
is
not
listed
in
Germany
they
are
powerless
to
pursue
the
matter
unless
they
snag
the
driver
in
a

stop
We
do

ask
the
public
to

identify
the
driver
as

Back
in
the
days
of
the
Vietnam
war
many
of
us
saw
the
anti
war
movement
as
not
so
much
anti
war
as
pro
Communist
Bill
Ayers
by
his
actions
and
writings
since
then
has
proven
that
view
to
be
exactly
right
Bill
Ayers
an
admirer
of
Hugo
Chavez
along
with
Nancy
Pelosi
and
the
Hollywood
elitists
have
done
the
same
Obama
is
his
own
book
says
he
searched
out
and
became
friends
with
Marxist
professors
Awhile
ago
I
posted
that
I
though
Obama
was
Hugo
Chavez
in
disguise
without
the
red
shirt
but
what
has
shocked
me
is
how
many
in
the
Democrat
Party
will
accept
and
promote
Communist
theory
as
if
it
didn't
have
a
history
of
internal
conflicts
with
freedom
Chavez
and
Danny
Ortega
put
opposition
journalists
and
politicians
in
jail
because
they
pose
a
threat
to
their
power
If
Obama
is
elected
we
will
start
seeing
the
same
here
If
you
think
we
have
free
speech
now
just
try
to
excersize
it
on
the
college
campus
or
the
black
community
It
will
get
worse

Samuel

said
today
in
Columbus
during
his
first
campaign
appearance

of
Republican
presidential
nominee
John

U.S

owners
on

tour
to
back

to

justice
done

Wurzelbacher
expressed
fears
that

under

He
also
agreed
with
a
man
in
the
audience
that
a
vote
for
Obama
is
a
vote
to
the
death
of
Israel
Portman
disagreed
with
that
statement
The
Obama
campaign
has
said
its
candidate
is
not
espousing
socialist
views
but
a
shift
in
tax
policy
to
cut
middle-class
taxes
and
raise
them
slightly
on
those
earning
more
than
250,000

Police

Wurzelbacher's
information
on

Department
of
Job
and
Family
Services
approved
a
check
on
Wurzelbacher
through
the
state's
child-support
computer
system
Director
Helen
Jones-Kelley
said
that
after
a
team
meeting
she
OK'd
the
check
because
the
department
often
runs
inquiries
to
check
for
unpaid
child
support
on
people
thrust
into
the
public
spotlight
Wurzelbacher
said
he
has
custody
of
his
13-year-old
son
and
neither
pays
nor
receives
child
support
leaving
him
puzzled
about
why
he
would
be
checked
Jones-Kelley
said
there
were
no
political
motivations
behind
the
check
The
Democratic
appointee
has
contributed
the
maximum
2,300
to
the
Obama
campaign
this
year
according
to
Federal
Election
Commission
records
Ohio
Senate
President
Bill
M
Harris
R-Ashland
wrote
Democratic
Gov
Ted
Strickland
that
he
was
disturbed
by
Jones-Kelley's
actions
and
statements
He
asked
for
records
and
an
explanation
Ohioans
are
once
again
questioning
the
stewardship
of
their
information
Harris
wrote
today
He
also
said
he
did
not
share
Strickland's
confidence
that
there
were
no
political
overtones
to
the
Wurzelbacher
check
State
Rep
William
G
Batchelder
R-Medina
called
for
the
director
to
be
placed
on
leave
until
the
investigation
is
complete
Strickland
spokesman
Keith
Dailey
attributed
the
Republicans
actions
to
baseless
political
attacks
amid
a
campaign
in
which
McCain
trails

If
you
think
Obama
wants
to
just
share
America's
wealth
with
Americans
you're
wrong
He
thinks
America
is
too
rich
and
is
therefore
required
to
turn
over
some
large
portion
of
its
wealth
to
the
rest
of
the
starving
world
He
wouldn't
send
his
half-brother
in
Kenya
10
but
you
will
be
forced
to
sent
something
It's
the
Leftist
way

Audio
Barack
Obama
admitted
that
he
was
drawn
to
Marxists
during
his
college
days
He
wrote
about
it
To
avoid
being
mistaken
for
a
sellout
I
chose
my
friends
carefully
The
more
politically
active
black
students
The
foreign
students
The
Chicanos
The
Marxist
professors
and
structural
feminists
He
even
talked
about
it

Bill

about
Obama's
Affinity
to
Marxists
today
at
Americans
Election
HQ
Barack
Obama
laughs
off
charges
of
socialism
Joe
Biden
scoffs
at
references
to
Marxism
Both
men
shrug
off
accusations
of
liberalism
But
Obama
himself
acknowledges
that
he
was
drawn
to
socialists
and
even
Marxists
as
a
college
student
He
continued
to
associate
with
Marxists
later
in
life
even
choosing
to
launch
his
political
career
in
the
living
room
of
a
self-described
Marxist
William
Ayers
in
1995
when
Obama
was
34
Obama's
affinity
for
Marxists
began
when
he
attended
Occidental
College
in
Los
Angeles
To
avoid
being
mistaken
for
a
sellout
I
chose
my
friends
carefully
the
Democratic
presidential
candidate
wrote
in
his
memoir
Dreams
From
My
Father
The
more
politically
active
black
students
The
foreign
students
The
Chicanos
The
Marxist
professors
and
structural
feminists
Obama's
interest
in
leftist
politics
continued
after
he
transferred
to
Columbia
University
in
New
York
He
lived
on
Manhattan's
Upper
East
Side
venturing
to
the
East
Village
for
what
he
called
the
socialist
conferences
I
sometimes
attended
at
Cooper
Union
After
graduating
from
Columbia
in
1983
Obama
spent
a
year
working
for
a
consulting
firm
and
then
went
to
work
for
what
he
described
as
a
Ralph
Nader
offshoot
in
Harlem
In
search
of
some
inspiration
I
went
to
hear
Kwame
Toure
formerly
Stokely
Carmichael
of
Black
Panther
fame
speak
at
Columbia
Obama
wrote
in
Dreams
which
he
published
in
1995
At
the
entrance
to
the
auditorium
two
women
one
black
one
Asian
were
selling
Marxist
literature
Obama
supporters
point
out
that
plenty
of
Americans
flirt
with
radical
ideologies
in
college
only
to
join
the
political
mainstream
later
in
life
But
Obama
who
made
a
point
of
noting
how
carefully
he
chose
his
friends
in
college
also
chose
to
launch
his
political
career
in
the
Chicago
living
room
of
Ayers
a
domestic
terrorist
who
in
2002
proclaimed
I
am
a
