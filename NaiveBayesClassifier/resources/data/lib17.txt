Rep
Raymond's
Video
Blog
Yesterday
Rep
Raymond
D-Laredo
became
the
first
Texas
state
representative
to
have
a
bilingual
video
blog
Traditionally
the
Legislature
is
slow
to
adopt
new
technology
e.g
recording
all
votes
so
seeing
a
member
adopt
this
tool
is
great
He
expects
to
film
two
per
week
but
I
hope
he
makes
the
time
to
film
more
I
also
really
dig
that
it
is
in
Spanish
as
well
Technology
has
given
us
an
opportunity
to
keep
our
constituents
more
fully
informed
on
the
important
issues
facing
our
state
With
this
new
tool
I
hope
to
bring
more
insight
into
the
legislative
process
and
make
it
easier
to
stay
informed
even
if
you
are
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
the
Capitol
Rep
Raymond
said
These
firsts
are
important
because
it
changes
our
expectation's
of
our
elected
officials
Ideally
the
more
contact
virtual
and
physical
they
have
with
their
constituency
the
more
responsive
they
will
become

McCall
throws
support
to
Pitts
From
a
press
conference
just
held
in
the
Appropriations
committee
room
McCall
has
given
his
support
to
Pitts
Pitts
claims
to
have
the
votes
to
win
the
Speakership
but
will
not
release
the
names
of
his
supporters
He
didn't
want
to
impose
on
his
supporters
the
wrath
and
phone
calls
from
the
Speaker
and
his
phone
bankers
Shrewd
move
by
not
releasing
the
names
Absolutely
Dems
probably
aren't
too
happy
but
it's
better
than
Craddick
However
having
a
secret
ballot
is
key
to
making
this
work
Looks
like
this
might
come
to
real
vote
on
the
house
floor
but
I
wouldn't
put
it
past
Craddick
to
start
really
cracking
some
skulls

Thanks
God
for
New

According
the
latest
issue
of
Education
Week
Texas
is
not
rated
as
last
on
the
Chance
for
Success
Index
see
map
We
are
rated
number
48
with
Mississippi
doing
better
The
new
Chance-for-Success
Index
developed
for
the
report
by
the
Editorial
Projects
in
Education
Research
Center
provides
a
state-focused
perspective
on
the
importance
of
education
throughout
a
person's
lifetime
The
index
is
based
on
13
indicators
that
highlight
whether
young
children
get
off
to
a
good
start
succeed
in
elementary
and
secondary
school
and
hit
crucial
educational
and
economic
benchmarks
as
adults
The
report
notes
that
Virginian
children
have
the
best
chance
of
succeeding
in
life
If
you
want
proof
of
that
just
visit
our
Austin-based
Virginian
transplant
Eileen
Tell
me
she
is
not
a
success
ok
maybe
not
a
dancing
but
she
is
always
good
for
a
laugh
and
you
don't
need
to
be
able
to
dance
to
be
successful
So
how
do
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
that
list
Chris
Swanson
who
conducted
the
research
says
in
the
case
of
the
worst
performers
it's
not
just
family
factors
at
work
It's
just
a
steady
stream
of
early
disadvantage
followed
by
ineffective
schools
followed
by
limited
opportunities
in
the
labor
force

Why
New
Years
is
important
I
think
most
holidays
are
silly
However
I
think
New
Years
is
important
In
spite
of
time
being
all
just
make
believe
it
is
important
to
us
as
a
whole
have
a
specific
start
and
stop
point
It
allows
us
to
take
an
accounting
and
have
a
pause
to
give
us
the
chance
to
change
course
You
are
who
you
choose
to
be
If
you
want
to
be
something
different
better
faster
or
slower
it
is
your
choice
You
are
in
full
control
Stop
being
such
a
chickenshit
Nothing
great
was
ever
achieved
by
being
timid
For
our
Lege
that
will
begin
in
earnest
in
one
week
you
have
the
chance
to
change
These
past
elections
should
be
the
Chuck
Norris
round
house
kick
to
your
head
that
jostles
you
from
your
partisan
slumber
Choose
to
do
what
is
best
for
you
district
and
the
people
of
Texas
because
we
have
started
to
hold
you
accountable
Just
ask
Gene
Seaman
For
TRS
we
will
be
broadcasting
with
a
more
blue-state
sensibility
due
to
geographic
influences
More
on
that
later

Year

Martha
Wong
lies
in
first
TV
spot
cuts
health
care
to
the
needy
Link
Lawmaker's
ad
touts
programs
she
voted
to
cut
As
contemporary
of
the
Wohlgeumuth
Rep
Martha
Wong
R-Houston
began
her
television
campaign
by
lying
through
her
teeth
State
Rep
Martha
Wong
says
in
her
first
TV
ad
of
the
season
that
she
helped
expand
health
care
to
the
poor
but
the
two-term
lawmaker
has
cast
several
votes
to
cut
such
programs
As
the
ad
shows
scenes
of
children
an
announcer
says
that
Wong
helped
the
truly
needy
gain
access
to
government
health
care
programs
like
Medicaid
Medicare
and
the
Children's
Health
Insurance
Program
During
her
first
term
in
2003
the
Houston
Republican
voted
for
a
state
budget
that
cut
almost
1
billion
from
health
programs
She
also
supported
a
major
restructuring
of
the
popular
CHIP
program
that
included
new
asset
tests
increases
in
co-payments
and
premiums
and
a
requirement
that
families
reapply
every
six
months
instead
of
once
a
year
Programs
like
CHIP
were
gutted
by
making
it
harder
and
more
expensive
for
the
working
poor
to
get
health
coverage
for
their
children
By
cutting
the
CHIP
program
Texas
left
hundreds
of
milllions
of
dollars
of
federal
matching
fund
on
the
table
We
has
a
chance
for
our
federal
tax
dollars
to
come
back
to
Texas
but
people
like
Wong
voted
to
allow
the
federal
government
to
keep
the
matching
funds
Thanks
for
making
Texas
a
donor
state
That
is
not
fically
responsilble
It
is
mean
and
stupid
Fact
check
In
2003
Wong
voted
for
a
state
budget
that
cut
1
billion
from
health
care
programs
She
also
voted
for
a
bill
that
changed
the
qualifications
for
CHIP
and
authorized
private
eligibility
call
centers
that
have
been
plagued
with
problems
this
year
and
caused
some
children
to
be
wrongly
denied
coverage
There
are
about
200,000
fewer
children
on
the
program
now
than
in
2003
Good
thing
Wong
has
a
real
opponent
in
Ellen
Cohen
Why
don't
you
all
check
her
out
volunteer
some
time
and
donate
to
Cohen
so
she
can
get
the
truth
out

Kinky
Racist
Via
AP
Newswire
A
Houston-area
lawmaker
said
Tuesday
that
she
is
vehemently
insulted
by
independent
gubernatorial
candidate
Kinky
Friedman's
derogatory
comments
about
Hurricane
Katrina
evacuees
Friedman
last
week
attributed
a
spike
in
Houston's
crime
rate
to
the
crackheads
and
thugs
who
evacuated
New
Orleans
He
has
demonstrated
a
total
lack
of
human
sensitivity
said
state
Rep
Senfronia
Thompson
D-Houston
The
people
of
Katrina
have
lost
everything
and
are
suffering
not
only
from
the
loss
of
loved
ones
but
the
trauma
of
the
event
itself
What
has
precipitated
from
this
tragedy
is
behavior
that
results
from
a
disastrous
event
What
a
dirtbag
It
reminds
me
of
the
comments
about
Katrina
victims
by
Barbara
Bush
Almost
everyone
I've
talked
to
says
We're
gonna
move
to
Houston
What
I'm
hearing
which
is
sort
of
scary
is
they
all
want
to
stay
in
Texas
Everybody
is
so
overwhelmed
by
the
hospitality
and
so
many
of
the
people
in
the
arenas
here
you
know
were
underprivileged
anyway
This
is
working
very
well
for
them
The
philosophical
question
is
do
racist
people
know
they
are
racists
or
are
they
just
too
stupid
to
breathe
The
time
is
nigh
We
must
help
Chris
Bell
win
this
one
Here
is
how
you
do
it
Talk
to
your
friends
and
family
if
they
have
a
pick
for
Governor
yet
Convince
them
why
Chris
Bell
will
be
the
best
choice
for
them
and
Texas
Make
sure
they
are
registered
to
vote
If
not
get
them

You
two
should
talk
Here's
an
idea
that
will
make
Republicans
foolish
and
greedy
if
they
oppose
it
Increase
the
minimum
wage
Democratic
gubernatorial
nominee
Chris
Bell
yesterday
said
that
as
Governor
he
would
push
for
increasing
the
state
minimum
wage
to
7
an
hour
over
three
years
and
indexing
it
to
the
Consumer
Price
Index
thereafter
Mr
Bell
introduced
similar
legislation
in
Congress
Congress
has
not
raised
the
federal
minimum
wage
since
1997
Since
then
18
states
and
the
District
of
Columbia
have
raised
their
state
minimum
wages
Four
states
Florida
Oregon
Vermont
and
Washington
have
indexed
their
state
minimum
wages
to
provide
for
automatic
annual
increases
According
to
the
Center
for
Public
Policy
Priorities
198,000
workers
make
the
minimum
wage
in
Texas
more
than
any
other
state
Most
87.5
percent
are
age
20
years
or
older
and
40
percent
are
the
sole
breadwinners
for
their
families
Ten
percent
of
the
state's
workforce
900,000
workers
would
receive
a
pay
raise
if
the
minimum
wage
rose
to
7
an
hour
When
the
Perry's
campaign
was
approached
with
this
idea
their
response
sounded
like
this
flippity-flop
Perry
Press
Secretary
Kathy
Walt
said
eh
maybe
Perry
Campaign
Mouthpiece
Robert
Black
said
hells
no
paraphrasing
mine
Let's
do
the
math
Minimum
wage
is
5.15
per
hr
x
40
hr
work
week
x
4
weeks
in
month
a
whopping
824.00
That
is
824.00
before
taxes
If
increased
to
7.00
an
hour
worker
would
a
36
increase
in
their
salary
Now
the
296
before
taxes
again
may
not
seem
like
a
lot
of
money
but
it
would
if
it
takes
you
over
a
week
to
earn
it
I
think
its
very
fair
to
bump
up
the
minimum
wage
Don't
let
people
Bill
Hammond
of
the
indicted
Texas
Association
of
Business
scared
you
into
to
thinking
otherwise
22
other
states
and
the
District
of
Columbia
have
increased
their
minimum
wage
because
they
are
tired
of
Congress
ineptitude
and
corruption
If
I
have
to
pay
a
few
pennies
more
so
peoples
lives
can
be
a
little
less
harder
then
I
have
no
problem
with
that
The
folks
at
the
Center
for
Public
Policy
Priorities
have
done
all
the
heavy
lifting
on
issues
of
poverty
and
low
wages
Check
them
out
They
are
very
good
at
what
they
do

Ciro
Rodriguez
bows
out
A
little
birdie
just
told
me
that
potential
CD
23
candidate
and
former
Congressman
Ciro
Rodriguez
will
not
run
for
Congressional
District
23
This
was
announced
at
the
local
AFL-CIO
meeting
tonight
by
Ciro
himself
I
suspect
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
inability
to
raise
enough
money
in
a
short
period
of
time
It
looks
like
this
race
will
be
between
Lukin
Gilliland
and
Henry
Bonilla
Ladies
and
Gentlemen
it
seems
we
have
a
horse
race
UPDATE
The
Quorum
Report
is
confirming
that
Ciro
is
out
of
the
race
The
question
now
becomes
will
his
name
be
removed
from
the
ballot
If
Rodriguez
name
remains
on
the
ballot
then
it
puts
the
Southside
of
San
Antonio
vote
in
flux
There
will
be
two
known
names
Uresti
and
Rodriguez
that
will
pull
votes
away
from
Bonilla
However
to
win
you
will
need
crossover
votes
from
the
more
conservative
parts
of
the
district
Will
Gilliland
be
able
to
capitalize
from
this
situation
Maybe
I
tend
to
think
this
will
help

This

Perry
wants
to
sell
off
Texas
parkland
After
the
flap
over
Black
Gap
you
figure
Perry
would
learn
a
lesson
or
two
guess
not
Gov
Rick
Perry's
office
worked
aggressively
behind
the
scenes
to
facilitate
the
auction
of
400
acres
of
state
parkland
in
Tarrant
County
to
the
highest
bidder
despite
growing
outcry
over
the
loss
of
Texas
parks
according
to
documents
obtained
by
the
Star-Telegram
While
publicly
distancing
itself
from
the
dealings
the
governor's
office
appears
to
have
privately
pushed
for
an
auction
that
would
guarantee
that
only
one-fourth
of
the
property
remained
green
space
according
to
e-mails
and
documents
obtained
through
the
state's
open-records
law
The
governor's
proposal
would
also
set
aside
several
gas
well
drilling
sites
on
the
400
acres
according
to
the
documents
The
property
is
at
Eagle
Mountain
Lake
just
northwest
of
Fort
Worth
and
has
become
the
subject
of
intense
interest
by
several
residential
developers
This
is
a
terrible
deal
for
Texas
parks
said
Luke
Metzger
an
advocate
with
the
Austin-based
Environment
Texas
Clearly
the
governor's
office
is
talking
out
of
both
sides
of
the
mouth
on
the
one
hand
Governor
Perry
says
he
wants
to
create
a
world-class
parks
system
but
then
behind
closed
doors
he's
pushing
to
develop
and
drill
this
natural
treasure
What
is
it
with
these
Republicans
and
desire
to
sell
off
parkland
First
they
promise
to
protect
and
expand
state
parkland
and
then
they
cut
off
spending
and
put
the
land
on
the
auction
block
Parents
Take
your
children
to
our
parks
soon
Who
knows
how
long
we
will
have
them
at
this
rate

Possible
Candidate
for
CD
23
There
has
been
lots
of
talk
of
who
will
run
against
Republican
Henry
Bonilla
for
Congressional
District
23
The
list
includes
Ciro
Rodriguez
much
to
many
people's
chagrin
Rick
Bolanos
Kyle
Kincaid
former
San
Antonio
mayor
Ed
Garza
state
Rep
Pete
Gallego
Julian
Castro
City
Councilman
Richard
Perez
who
represents
the
Southwest
Side
Richard
Gambitta
a
political
scientist
and
chairman
of
the
political
science
and
geography
department
at
the
University
of
Texas
at
San
Antonio
and
Albert
Uresti
a
retired
San
Antonio
Fire
Department
district
chief
and
brother
of
state
Rep
Carlos
Uresti
A
new
and
interesting
name
has
popped
up
Local
restaurateur
Lukin
Gilliland
Jr
is
reported
to
be
expressing
an
interest
I'm
kicking
this
around
he
said
this
week
but
declined
to
comment
further
Several
Democratic
activists
said
Gilliland
54
had
been
making
the
rounds
of
potential
supporters
for
days
Lukin's
talking
to
a
lot
of
people
making
a
lot
of
phone
calls
local
Democratic
consultant
JoAnn
Ramon
said
Gilliland
is
not
shy
in
giving
money
to
Democrats
and
their
causes
The
Texas
Ethics
Commission
reports
that
Gilliland
has
given
over
31,000
in
the
past
6
years
The
Federal
Election
Commission
reports
that
he
has
given
over
100,000
in
the
past
9
years
Given
that
the
Bonilla
has
2
million
in
the
warchest
being
able
to
self
fund
early
on
is
important
Unfortunately
for
Ciro
Rodriguez
I
think
people
are
tired
and
burned
out
giving
to
Ciro
whose
last
race
against
Henry
Cuellar
was
a
complete
failure
in
spite
of
some
impressive
netroots
support
While
this
a
winnable
district
it
only
can
be
won
with
the
Democrats
uniting
behind
one
candidate
Give
Ciro's
track
record
and
missed
opportunities
many
are
looking
for
someone
else
to
climb
this
mountain
I
hope
people's
hubris
will
not
get
in
the
way
of
a
Democrat
winning
this
seat
ahem
you
know
who
you
are
There
is
nothing
wrong
with
taking
one
for
the
team
As
of
Friday
August
18
only
Bonilla
has
filed
The
deadline
to
file
with
the
Secretary
of

for

The

states
that

Shocking
Here
we

I
hope
the

are
more

the
abridgement

Wanna
help
a
Congressional
campaign
The
Lloyd
Doggett
Re-Election
Campaign
is
seeking
volunteers
and
interns
that
can
assist
Congressman
Doggett
and
the
campaign
staff
with
a
range
of
responsibilities
Join
our
team
and
show
the
Republicans
how
hard
we
Texas
Democrats
fight
and
persevere
despite
their
partisan
redistricting
efforts
Volunteers
are
needed
to
help
with
mailings
phone
banks
canvassing
office/computer
needs
and
other
necessary
tasks
Interns
would
work
directly
with
all
levels
of
campaign
staff
on
important
tasks
and
would
receive
invaluable
experience
on
a
US
Congressional
race
As
an
intern
you
would
need
to
be
able
to
commit
15-20
hours
a
week
until
the
election
If
you
are
interested
in
either
opportunity
please

San
Antonio
candidate
Barbara
Scharf-Zeldes
unveils
1st
deaf
accessible
campaign
in
US
Barbara
ScharfZeldes
candidate
for
Probate
Court
2
in
Bexar
County
San
Antonio
recently
unveiled
the
first
website
of
a
political
candidate
in
the
nation
to
be
deaf
and
hard
of
hearing
accessible
The
site
will
offer
sign
language
for
deaf
and
hard-of-hearing
visitors
Members
from
the
deaf
community
who
have
felt
disenfranchised
from
the
political
process
will
also
be
registering
to
vote
as
part
of
the
announcement
By
registering
they
hope
to
send
a
message
that
they
will
support
candidates
who
believe
in
equal
access
to
the
political
process
for
all
people
In
San
Antonio
an
estimated
116,000
people
are
deaf
or
hard
of
hearing
Most
people
mistakenly
believe
that
if
one
communicates
information
in
writing
to
a
person
who
is
deaf
they
will
understand
what
is
being
written
Statistics
indicate
that
sign
language
is
the
primary
vehicle
for
communication
for
the
deaf
and
that
most
people
who
are
deaf
only
read
on
a
second
or
third
grade
level
This
misinformation
has
been
a
major
obstacle
to
participation
in
the
electoral
process
for
the
deaf
and
hard
of
hearing
Now
that
is
really
reaching
out
to
all
the
voters
I
guess
it
is
also
the
nature
of
the
court
Probate
courts
deal
with
will
estates
appoint
guardian
ad
litems
for
a
orphaned
children
address
eminent
domain
issue
i.e
when
the
government
wants
to
condemn
your
private
property
for
public
use
and
determines
who
get
committed
to
get
help
for
mental
health
problems
For
the
last
13
years
Barbie
has
been
an
attorney
for
San
Antonio
police
officers
and
firefighters
and
their
familes
She
has
guided
them
through
the
difficult
issues
surrounding
wills
their
estates
and
guardianships
for
seniors
and
children
I
can
personally
vouch
for
Barbie
She
very
qualified
and
thoughtful
person
If
you
ever
in
probate
court
it
is
usually
because
of
a
life
altering
event
I
can't
think
of
a
better
person
to
fill
such
an
important
judicial
position
in
the
community

biography
