Ties
in
MO
and
NC
By
Dr
Steven
Taylor
Via
the
Politico
Poll
Dead
heats
in
2
key
swing
states
Barack
Obama
and
John
McCain
are
evenly
matched
in
the
swing
states
of
North
Carolina
and
Missouri
though
Obama
is
strongly
outpacing
McCain
in
two
of
those
states
crucial
battleground
counties
according
to
new
Politico/InsiderAdvantage
polls
In
North
Carolina
Obama
and
McCain
were
tied
with
48
percent
of
the
vote
Only
3
percent
of
voters
in
the
state
remain
undecided
In
Missouri
McCain
led
Obama
50
percent
to
47
percent
an
edge
that
was
within
the
margin
of
error
This
is
good
news
for
the
McCain
camp
and
part
of
the
tightening
that
I
noted
last
night
However
the
bad
news
for
McCain
is
twofold
First
the
very
fact
that
these
states
are
in
play
Bush
states
in
2000
and
2004
and
NC
is
a
reliable
GOP
state
underscores
the
fundamental
difficulties
he
has
Second
Obama
has
reasonable
scenarios
in
which
he
wins
handily
even
without
Indiana
and
North
Carolina
Mccain
however
does
not
The
only
GOP
good
news
would
be
that
if
NC
is
in
fact
tightening
substantially
that
that
would
help
Elizabeth
Dole
retain
her
Senate
seat
she
currently
appears
to
be
in
some
trouble
in
that
regard

More
on
Palin
in
2012
By
Dr
Steven
Taylor
This
time
from
Palin
herself
via
ABC
News
Sarah
Palin
Not
Doing
This
For
Naught
In
an
interview
with
ABC
News
Elizabeth
Vargas
the
Republican
vice-presidential
nominee
was
asked
about
2012
whether
she
was
discouraged
by
the
daily
attacks
on
the
campaign
trail
and
would
instead
pack
it
in
and
return
to
her
home
state
of
Alaska
I
think
that
if
I
were
to
give
up
and
wave
a
white
flag
of
surrender
against
some
of
the
political
shots
that
we've
taken
that
would
bring
this
whole
I'm
not
doing
this
for
naught
Palin
said
That
is
a
rather
curious
response
as
it
is
not
typically
considered
politic
to
speculate
about
post-election
plans
before
all
the
votes
have
been
cast
especially
if
that
speculation
infers
that
one
is
thinking
about
what
happens
if
one
loses
It
is
really
a
rookie
mistake
The
interesting
thing
to
watch
will
be
how
well
see
actually
wears
on
the
base
as
they
have
yet
to
get
a
full
dose
of
her
views
She
remains
in
many
ways
a
Rorschach
candidate
For
example
Polimom
noted
the
other
day
that
Palin's
views
on
immigration
which
were
heretofore
unknown
don't
sit
well
with
some
segments
of
the
base
It
is
easy
for
the
base
to
love
Palin
now
as
they
know
for
sure
she
is
a
rock-solid
pro-lifer
and
yet
no
one
really
knows
for
sure
all
that
much
beyond
that
Political
love
between
a
group
of
voters
and
a
candidate
is
almost
always
inverse
to
the
actual
amount
of
information
that
the
voters
have
about
said
candidate
That
is
not
btw
a
slam
on
Palin
specifically
or
really
a
slam
at
all
Indeed
I
ask
the
reader
what
politician
have
you
actually
liked
more
and
more
that
more
that
one
actually
knew
about
the
life
and
views
of
that
politician
More
knowledge
always
means
more
chances
to
find
fault

On
Race
Tightening
By
Dr
Steven
Taylor
There
has
been
some
talk
of
the
race
between
McCain
and
Obama
tightening
as
we
hit
the
home
stretch
for
example
Chuck
Todd
was
writing
about
it
yesterday
and
I
heard
it
discussed
on
an
NPR
program
I
am
not
sure
which
one
late
this
morning
An
example
of
actual
numbers
from
earlier
in
the
week
the
Gallup
daily
tracking
poll
had
a
two
point
gap
and
then
a
three
point
gap
today
it
is
back
to
five
Such
numbers
along
with
some
internal
polling
has
led
McCain's
pollster
Bill
McInturff
to
put
a
rosier
spin
on
the
numbers
than
has
been
the
case
of
late
some
discussion
of
this
can
be
found
in
Slate
and
a
response
by
pollster
Stan
Greenberg
in
the
form
of
lengthy
letter
to
McInturff
analyzing
the
current
state
of
the
numbers
as
well
as
in
the
Todd
piece
linked
above
All
of
this
tighrening
talk
leads
me
to
make
three
observations
1
Of
course
there
is
some
tightening
of
the
race
at
this
point
As
we
come
closer
to
the
actual
election
we
typically
see
a
narrowing
of
the
gap
between
the
candidates
as
undecided
voters
actually
well
decide
It
is
also
during
this
period
that
polling
in
general
becomes
more
accurate
because
the
data
being
gathered
is
in
the
context
of
an
actual
decision
being
made
rather
than
in
the
context
of
a
decision
that
will
be
made
at
some
point
in
the
future
which
is
convoluted
way
of
saying
that
the
numbers
get
more
accurate
the
closer
to
the
election
that
one
gets
2
It
is
in
the
McCain
camp's
interest
to
play
up
any
shift
in
their
direction
They
are
faced
with
the
daunted
task
of
an
almost
insurmountable
uphill
climb
the
math
is
what
the
math
is
As
such
they
need
to
motivate
their
voters
and
themselves
with
as
much
hope
as
possible
3
Despite
the
notion
that
the
MSM
is
totally
in
the
tank
for
Obama
it
is
in
their
best
interest
to
talk
up
the
horse
race
aspect
of
the
situation
and
to
especially
point
to
any
evidence
of
race-tightening
After
all
who's
going
to
watch
the
news
if
it
is
cast
as
a
fait
accompli
The
MSM's
main
bias
is
not
towards
liberals
it
is
towards
drama
because
drama
brings
eyeballs
to
the
sets
Having
said
all
of
that
the
race
really
doesn't
appear
to
be
tightening
in
a
way
to
suggest
that
it
is
actually
within
McCain's
reach
Whether
one
looks
at
Gallup
Zogby
538
Pollster.com
or
RCP
the
EC
map
looks
rather
Obamish
Again
the
math
is
the
math

If
I
were
in
charge
of
the
McCain
campaign
I'd
be
talking
about
2000
All
of
the
polls
and
academics
had
Gore
winning
but
Bush
won
the
Presidency
I
would
probably
fail
to

And
so
it
Begins
By
Dr
Steven
Taylor
The
recession
that
is
and
actually
that
should
be
began
GDP
report
shows
economy
shrank
in
3Q
The
Commerce
Department
reported
that
the
gross
domestic
product
the
broadest
measure
of
economic
health
fell
at
an
annual
rate
of
0.3
percent
in
the
July-September
period
a
significant
slowdown
after
growth
of
2.8
percent
in
the
prior
quarter
And
that
was
during
the
period
while
some
of
the
stimulus
checks
were
still
coming
out

I'm
saying
this
now
for
the
record
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
OBAMA
recession
We
know
that
the
Dems
are
going
to
blame
their
ineffectiveness
on
inheriting
Bush's
problems
But
since
the
recession
comes
the
day
after
Obama's
infomercial
it
is
clear
he
is
the
responsible
party

Ok
So
now
the
question
is
how
long
will
said
recession
last
I'm
betting
two
quarters
This
would
actually
be
impressive
because
it
would
mean
people
won't
Christmas
shop
us
out
of
this
recession
Sometime
in
spring

home
sales
will
hit
an
uptick
and
then
it's
on
to

I
do
understand
that
however
I
am
sufficiently
convinced
that
things
aren't
likely
to
grow
in
the
4th
qtr
so
I
am
content
to
assert
that
it
has
begun
I
will
be

happy
if
I
am

I
agree
with
you
I
just
wanted
to
mention
the
fact
that
officially
we
find
out
about
these
things
much
later
Sometimes
after

is

True
I
just
fear
that
this
one
may
last
long
enough
that
we
will
know
we
are
in
it
before
it
is
over
Although
may
King
be
right
two
quarters
would
be
a
minor
miracle
and
welcome
news

We've
Officially
Hit
the
Desperation
Phase
By
Dr
Steven
Taylor
Or
at
least
the
ridiculous
phase
Via
Fox
News
Joe
the
Plumber
Backs
Claim
That
Obama
Would
Bring
Death
to
Israel
and
Via
the
Politico
Joe
the
Plumber
pursued
for
record
deal
In
regards
to
the
latter
I
am
mostly
bemused
if
the
man
wants
to
milk
his
fifteen
minutes
of
fame
for
all
it
is
worth
including
a
country
music
album
more
power
to
him
All
I
can
say
is
only
in
America
The
former
however
is
plain
bizarre
as
Joe
made
his
claims
whilst
on
the
trail
with
the
McCain
campaign
The
CSM's
the
vote
blog
elaborates
Joe
the
Plumber
is
now
Joe
the
foreign
policy
advisor
How
did
Joe
the
Plumber
begin
dispensing
foreign
policy
advice
Simple
There
was
a
Joe
the
Plumber
bus
tour
yesterday
in
Ohio
Joe
the
Plumber
aka
Joe
Wurzelbacher
teamed
up
with
Congressman
Rob
Portman
who
was
allegedly
on
McCain's
VP
short
list
and
they
went
to
five
different
towns
in
Ohio
stumping
for
the
Republican
nominee
Wurzelbacher
was
doing
everything
you
do
on
the
campaign
trail
You
know
shaking
hands
talking
to
people
kissing
babies
taking
pictures
saying
a
vote
for
Barack
Obama
dooms
Israel
If
it
wasn't
already
official
I
think
we
can
now
declare
it
the
McCain
campaign
has
hit
the
desperation
phase

I
would
call
it
the
tragic
phase
Or
tragicomic
if
you
prefer
Desperation
began
back
in
the
days
before
the
convention
and
ended
somewhere
over
the
last
few
days
We've
clearly
entered
a
new
phase
now
And
it
isn't
pretty

Mr

was

Yes
tragicomic

Indeed
one
could
argue
that
the

was
the

More
on
Palin
2012
By
Dr
Steven
Taylor
Marc
Ambinder
tries
to
make
Palin
In
2012
The
Argument
and
notes
the
following
She
is
a
favorite
of
talk
radio
and
Fox
News
conservatives
and
speaks
their
language
as
only
a
true
member
of
the
club
can
Her
recent
Limbaugh
interview
was
full
of
dog
whistles
that
any
Dittohead
would
recognize
Including
her
actual
use
of
the
word
ditto
All
true
However
let
me
point
out
that
Jack
Kemp
and
Phil
Gramm
were
Limbaugh
favorites
as
well
Further
the
current
nominee
McCain
unless
we've
already
forgotten
was
decidedly
not
the
fav
of
conservative
talk
radio
As
such
I
see
such
support
as
an
asset
to
be
sure
but
it
is
hardly
sufficient
to
propel
one
to
the
nomination

The
only
way
Palin
will
go
from
punchline
to
mainstream
is
by
getting
out
in
front
of
people
more
She
should
1
run
for
Senator
or
2
get
a
news
program
not
an
infotainment
program
Then
she
needs
to
hit
on
the
issues
she
has
credibility
on
energy
children's
health
issues
etc
If
she
joins
the
right
wing
attack
machine
by
always
guesting
on
Rush
and
Hannity
she
doesn't
have
much
of
a
chance

Win
or
Lose
Many
See
Palin
as
Future
of
Party
Whether
the
Republican
presidential
ticket
wins
or
loses
on
Tuesday
a
group
of
prominent
conservatives
are
planning
to
meet
the
next
day
to
discuss
the
way
forward
and
whatever
the
outcome
Gov
Sarah
Palin
will
be
high
on
the
agenda
This
is
hardly
surprising
and
indeed
it
seems
that
the
signals
from
Palin
and
her
allies
within
the
McCain
campaign
are
such
that
they
know
that
they
are
likely
to
lose
and
so
the
planning
for
next
time
has
begun
While
it
seems
likely
at
least
at
the
moment
that
she
will
be
in
the
GOP
mix
in
2012
I
have
a
very
hard
time
seeing
her
winning
the
nomination
If
anything
all
of
her
weaknesses
will
be
totally
exposed
when
she
moves
from
running
mate
to
prime
candidate
There
is
no
hiding
from
the
press
if
one
is
on
center
stage
Further
one
has
to
have
an
answer
for
a
panoply
of
questions
if
one
is
in
that
position
I
have
to
wonder
in
fact
if
once
the
dust
settles
on
the
current
campaign
if
the
bigwigs
in
the
GOP
upon
due
consideration
decide
that
Palin
is
worth
backing
That
does
remain
to
be
seen
of
course
While
it
is
true
that
the
2012
process
basically
starts
on
November
5th
for
the
party
that
loses
the
election
an
awful
lot
will
happen
between
now
and
then
to
determine
what
kind
of
candidate
will
have
a
shot
at
running
a
serious
bid
for
the
nomination
let
alone
who
will
have
a
real
shot
at
winning
Not
only
is
it
likely
that
Romney
and
Huckabee
will
launch
a
second
bid
there
are
other
out
there
who
are
not
immediately
obvious
candidates
Palin
herself
is
the
embodiment
of
the
fact
that
one
never
knows
for
sure
who
will
be
prominent
in
presidential
politics
four
years
down
the
road
A
lot
of
this
too
had
to
do
with
what
direction
the
Republican
Party
will
go
Many
will
take
the
lesson
of
2008
assuming
defeat
that
McCain
wasn't
authentic
enough
as
a
conservative
and
there
will
be
an
emphasis
on
appealing
to
the
base
meaning
it
would
seem
by
the
current
definition
of
the
base
social
conservatives/evangelicals
and
especially
southern
voters
the
voters
Palin
very
much
appeals
to
However
the
problem
with
that
approach
is
of
course
that
they
have
those
voters
now
and
that
cadre
of
voters
does
not
appear
sufficient
for
victory
Others
in
the
party
will
say
that
McCain's
failing
was
insufficient
appeal
beyond
the
base
which
will
end
up
to
be
numerically
true
on
Tuesday
one
suspects
but
it
seems
likely
that
the
former
voices
will
prevail
in
that
debate
Of
course
the
exact
shape
of
the
debate
will
not
be
known
until
we
know
how
an
Obama
presidency
goes
and
what
issues
develop
in
the
world
over
the
next
four
years
again
assuming
that
McCain
doesn't
win
If
Palin
were
to
emerge
as
the
nominee
in
2012
she
will
be
bucking
history
as
failed
VP
nominees
do
not
have
a
good
success
rate
in
such
maneuvers
To
wit
consider
the
following
list
Losing
VP
Nominees
1952-2004
2004
Edwards
2000
Lieberman
1996
Kemp
1992
Quayle
1988
Bentsen
1984
Ferraro
1980
Mondale
1976
Dole
1972
Shriver
1968
Muskie
1964
Miller
1960
Lodge
1956
Kefauver
1952
Sparkman
Not
only
did
all
but
one
of
these
individuals
not
come
back
in
four
years
to
win
their
party's
nomination
my
guess
is
that
most
of
us
haven't
heard
of
a
good
number
of
them
In
that
list
the
only
example
of
the
losing
VP
nominee
coming
back
and
winning
his
party's
was
Walter
Mondale
in
1984
and
he
had
actually
been
the
Vice
President
from
1976-1980
Dole
went
from
VP
nominee
to
presidential
candidate
as
well
but
it
took
him
two
decades
to
achieve
the
feat
In
the
last
several
cycles
we
have
seen
Lieberman
and
Edwards
both
try
to
come
from
being
a
losing
running
mate
to
the
party's
nominee
with
obviously
unsatisfactory
to
them
anyway
results
It
should
be
noted
of
course
that
not
all
of
the
failed
veepables
even
tried
for
the
top
slot
the
next
time
out
of
course
some
likely
didn't
try
because
they
knew
their
likely
fate
At
any
rate
while
I
suspect
that
Palin
isn't
fully
going
away
after
next
week
again
assuming
that
the
race
is
going
the
direction
it
appears
to
be
going
but
I
wouldn't
be
penciling
her
into
the
GOP
top
slot
in
2012
just
yet

It's
always
fun
to
guess
who'll
be
politically
active
four
years
in
the
future
But
it's
also
nearly
impossible
There
was
a
time
I
would
have
expected
Gingrich
to
run
for
President
And
there
was
a
time
I
would
have
expected
Gore
to
run
for
Senator
or
to
lobby
for
a
judgeship

i
think
the
bottom
line
is
that
it
is
probably
a
moot
point
to
speculate
about
palin's
political
future
today
four
years
is
a
long
period
of
time
and
there
are
lots
of
others
romney
for
example
who
want
to
have
a
say
in
this

I'd
say
Palin's
grasp
of
the
world
is
about
that
of
a
smart
12
year
old
the
type
who
might
one
day
become
president
So
she
has
about
4
years
to
gain
20
years
experience

Also
being
way
ahead
at
this
point
doesn't
necessarily
do
much
for
you
We
spent
almost
three
years
assuming
that
Hilary
Clinton
would
run
away
with
the
Democratic
nomination
but
that
didn't
help
her
in
the
end

But
it
gets
worse
if
you
can
believe
that
The
writer
chose
a
non-newsworthy
headline
over
some
real
news
in
his
own
story
Republican
John
McCain
canceled
a
rally
50
miles
north
in
Quakertown
hardly
insignificant
given
the
dwindling
campaign
time
What
The
weather
not
good
for
his
dwindling
campaign
or
was
it
not
good
for

Obama
had
9000

Barack
Obama

a
bold
and

leader

nice
true
in
and
of
itself
that
headline
doesn't
seem
like
all
that
much
but
i
was
under
the
impression
that
a
contrast
was
being
made
between
obama's
choice
to
continue
versus
mccain's
choice
to
cancel
and
that
to
me
is
something
worth
reading
about
notwithstanding
the
lame
headline

More
on
the
NC
Ballot
By
Dr
Steven
Taylor
Speaking
of
the
North
Carolina
ballot
here's
a
screencap
of
the
portion
of
the
ballot
with
the
instructions
for
voting
for
president
taken
from
the
Alamance
County
sample
ballot
One
will
note
that
this
section
is
above
the
straight
ticket
section
Granted
the
instructions
are
pretty
clear
Still
the
basic
rule
for
ballot
design
should
be
simplicity
Any
complication
that
can
be
avoided
should
be
avoid
For
example
as
a
ballot
designer
one
has
to
anticipate
that
there
will
be
voters
who
will
rush
to
the
Straight
Ticket
section
and
not
pay
as
careful
attention
as
they
should
On
the
one
hand
it
is
clearly
the
responsibility
of
all
voters
to
read
the
instructions
on
the
other
it
is
the
state's
responsibility
in
a
democracy
to
make
the
voting
process
as
easy
as
possible
There
is
also
the
possible
problem
that
the
semi-literate
would
be
able
to
recognize
Straight
Ticket
and
go
there
while
no
being
able
to
read
and
comprehend
the
instructions
Sample
ballots
for
all
NC
counties
can
be
found
here

Yes
there
are
complaints
that
in
the
past
two
presidential
elections
2-3
of
NC
ballots
did
not
have
a
vote
for
president
because
people
voted
straight
ticket
and
didn't
pay
attention

I
think
this
really
just
hurts
Democrats
down
the
ticket
because
I
feel
we
will
see
the
biggest
influx
of
new
voters
likely
African-American
and
they
may
just
vote
for
Obama
rather
than
the
ticket
