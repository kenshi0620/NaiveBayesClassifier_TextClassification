If
you
are
a
moderate
Republican
who
wants
to
bring
the
Party
of
Lincoln
back
to
its
roots
you've
come
to
the
right
place
I
am
your
host
Dennis
Sanders
a
30something
gay
African
American
Republican
minister
living
in
Minneapolis
Minnesota
It
is
my
hope
that
the
Moderate
Republican
is
the
start
of
an
online
movement
to
strengthen
and
encourage
Republicans
in
the
tradition
of
Abe
Lincoln
Teddy
Roosevelt
and
Dwight
Eisenhower
Moderate
Republicans
look
for
pragmatic
solutions
to
national
problems
instead
of
pre-cut
ideological
solutions

you

Republicanism
