Voters
Shmoters
Judge
in
San
Francisco
says
gay
marriage
ban
approved
by
voters
is
unconstitutional
I've
been
reading
Men
in
Black
by
Mark
Levin
I
always
knew
judicial
overreach
was
a
problem
but
had
no
idea
of
its
extent
before
reading
this
book
While
I
tend
to
support
a
compromise
on
this
issue
I
think
that
the
major
problem
is
the
radical
judiciary
This
judge
never
should
have
ignored
the
will
of
the
voters
of
California
For
years
conservatives
have
been
focusing
on
the
symptoms
of
this
problem
the
actual
judgments
of
those
who
legislate
from
the
bench
At
the
same
time
we've
been
ignoring
the
root
of
the
problem
the
fact
that
activist
judges
were
being
nominated
by
the
president
at
the
time
William
Jefferson
Clinton
Now
when
we
have
the
chance
to
nominate
judges
that
will
uphold
the
law
the
Senate
Republican
leadership
is
capitulating
and
refusing
to
take
action
Cases
like
this
should
push
Republicans
to
contact
their
leadership
in
the
Senate
and
demand
movement
on
the
nomination
of
judges
I
don't
care
how
scary
the
nuclear
option
is
to
the
leadership
it
should
be
set
in
motion
A
minority
of
Democrats
cannot
be
allowed
to
obstruct
the
president's
constitutional
power
and
continue
the
status
quo
that
presently
exists
where
judges
are
creating
legislation
from
the
bench
with
no
constitutional
basis
for
their
rulings

Hollywood's
War
I'm
half-watching
The
Siege
on
USA
It's
a
movie
from
1998
about
terrorist
attacks
on
New
York
city
leading
to
martial
law
hate
crimes
against
Muslims
and
mass
roundups
of
Arab
citizens
What's
most
striking
about
the
film
is
how
inaccurate
it
is
post-September
11
Four
years
after
terrorists
murdered
over
3,000
citizens
nothing
like
what
the
movie
portrays
has
happened
in
the
United
States
a
fact
for
which
we
should
be
grateful
The
movie
is
gripping
and
reasonably
well-acted
but
feels
dated
and
gratingly
wrong
considering
how
we
really
responded
to
attacks
on

Liberal
Dreams
Eleanor
Clift
tries
to
make
the
case
that
Hillary
Clinton
in
her
recent
political
evolution
is
frustrating
the
right
by
proving
different
from
the
caricature
they
made
of
her
Clift
says
that
Hillary
is
a
formidable
candidate
because
she
understands
the
cultural
weakness
of
the
Democratic
party
Her
evidence
That
Hillary
has
recently
come
out
against
our
sex
and
violence-drenched
media
This
Clift
believes
will
make
her
nearly
unbeatable
by
any
Republican
candidate
Of
course
to
prove
this
point
Clift
compares
Hillary
to
two
candidates
Senate
Majority
Leader
Bill
Frist
and
Secretary
of
State
Condoleeza
Rice
She
doesn't
mention
the
one
candidate
the
Democrats
are
probably
most
worried
about
and
who
currently
leads
most
Republican
primary
polls
former
New
York
Governor
Rudy
Guiliani
Bill
Frist
has
no
chance
of
becoming
the
Republican
presidential
nominee
Simply
put
the
man
is
a
wimp
He's
allowed
the
Democrats
to
walk
all
over
the
Republicans
in
the
Senate
and
still
shows
no
indication
he's
willing
to
fight
them
just
empty
threat
after
empty
threat
Rank
and
file
Republicans
are
angry
at
the
seeming
ineffectiveness
of
the
Senate
leadership
Unless
Frist
does
something
impressive
fast
he
will
be
a
Gary
Bauer-sized
blip
on
the
radar
Rice
would
make
a
good
vice-presidential
pick
but
probably
doesn't
have
the
experience
to
run
as
a
major-party
candidate
Clift
is
also
wrong
on
the
issues
that
matter
to
voters
Those
concerned
about
social
issues
won't
fall
all
over
themselves
for
Hillary
based
on
her
views
on
video
games
and
movies
It's
her
views
on
social
issues
like
abortion
euthanasia
gay
marriage
and
others
that
will
determine
how
social
issues
voters
look
at
a
Hillary
candidacy
In
addition
Clift
ignores
a
major
fact
as
a
presidential
candidate
Hillary
would
represent
not
only
herself
but
a
party
that
has
spent
the
past
four
years
alienating
itself
from
middle-America
If
secondary
social
issues
and
third-tier
candidates
are
all
Clift
has
to
offer
in
defense
of
a
Hillary
candidacy
I
think
more
work
needs
to
be
done
I
think
Hillary
could
make
a
good
candidate
She
just
needs
to
find
a
different
party

Bush
Hatred
Still
Wizbang

a
post
on
an
episode
of
Bush-hatred
gone
awry
A

in
Florida
chased
a

with

sticker
on

and
tried
to
run
her
off
the

Here

I've
seen
a
number
of
cars
with
their
Kerry-Edwards
stickers
still
prominently
displayed
Other
cars
are
practically
plastered
with
anti-Bush
slogans
I
saw
one
today
that
said
George
W
Bush
Worst
President
Ever
Another
car
had
the
charming
slogan
Who
Would

Bomb
Advice

The
challenge
to

this

been
going
on
for
five

The

Like

over

over
Bush
cannot
run

again
it's

start
focusing
your
hatred
on
something

Or
better
yet

coming
up

to
actually
counter

instead
of
urging
Democrats
to
simply
oppose
everything
Bush
does
And
while
I'm
at
it

stickers
It's
getting

My
Tax
Dollars
at
Work
It's
not
often
that
one
can
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
in
taxes
and
see
poor
government
service
on
the
same
day
but
today
was
one
of
those
days
I
paid
my
over-$250
excise
tax
this
morning
when
I
registered
the
new
car
and
drove
to
work
on
roads
that
had
yet
to
see
much
effort
from
the
public
works
department
I'm
pretty
forgiving
in
the
morning
though
Bangor
has
a
lot
of
roads
Just
got
back
from
getting
lunch
though
and
the
roads
are
pretty
much
as
they
were
this
morning
including
Union
and
Hammond
Streets
two
main
arteries
of
the
city
It's
been
much
the
same
this
whole
winter
the
worst
winter
for
snow
removal
I
can
remember
since
I
moved
to
the
state
We
have
had
a
lot
of
storms
but
we're
also
paying
quite
a
bit
every
year
in
taxes
for
vehicles
we
already
own
The
non-plowed
roads
lead
to
more
accidents
which
means
more
costs
in
terms
of
police
sent
to
the
many
fender-benders
in
the
city
after
a
storm
Count
in
the
money
lost
by
retailers
when
customers
don't
feel
like
going
out
on
unplowed
roads
and
you've
got
quite
a
tidy
sum
of
cash
going
all
because
the
roads
weren't
thoroughly
cleaned
of
snow
Snow
removal
is
one
of
the
basic
responsibilities
of
the
city
after
a
storm
and
this
year
it
hasn't
been
done
that
well
Perhaps
it's
time
to
contract
out
the
service
to
private
firms
and
see
if
service
improves
when
market-based
competition
is
introduced

So
What
Is
It
You
Do
Exactly
That
is
one
of
my
favorite
lines
from
Office
Space
in
which
one
of
the
consultants
asks
Tom
Symkowski
about
his
job
Symkowski
mutters
inanities
about
customer
service
that
have
no
practical
value
to
the
company
and
the
consultants
decide
his
job
is
pointless
and
should
be
eliminated
The
editors
of
the
BDN
would
have
made
terrible
consultants
In
this
editorial
they
are
attempting
to
prop
up
Mohamed
ElBaradei
the
head
of
the
International
Atomic
Energy
Agency
They
snarkily
insinuate
that
the
Bush
administration
wants
to
fire
ElBaradei
because
his
report
found
no
weapons
of
mass
destruction
in
Iraq
The
BDN
tells
the
Bush
administration
to
leave
ElBaradei
alone
becuase
he's
doing
such
a
good
job
How
do
we
know
this
Well
it's
obvious
Anyone
who
says
stuff
like
this
must
be
incredibly
effective
His
final
step
was
to
acknowledge
the
volatility
of
long-standing
tensions
that
give
rise
to
proliferation
in
regions
such
as
the
Middle
East
and
the
Korean
peninsula
and
take
action
to
resolve
existing
security
problems
and
where
needed
provide
security
assurances."Wow
Be
still
my
beating
heart
What
a
man
of
action
The
only
action
ElBaradei
did
that
came
close
to
being
effective
was
his
last-minute
release
of
a
report
on
missing
munitions
in
Iraq
that
John
Kerry
and
the
media
used
as
a
club
against
the
president
in
the
final
week
of
the
campaign
I'm
sure
the
timing
on
that
report
was
just
a
coincidence
In
the
past
four
years
critics
of
the
administration
have
blamed
President
Bush
for
souring
relations
with
the
international
community
Funny
how
none
of
those
critics
seem
to
notice
how
hostile
the
international
community
has
been
to
the
president
and
how
their
actions
are
more
harmful
to
US-world
relations
than
anything
President
Bush
has
done
I
guess
for
liberal
editorial
writers
blaming
the
president
is
a
lot
easier
than
giving
up
their
illusions
about
the
utopia
of
Europe

Thanks

from

He
reminded
me
of
the
time
three
of
us
went
here
and
decided
to
deviate
from
the
trail
We
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
camp
in

Of

there
was
a
terrible
thunderstorm
that
evening
and
we
didn't
have
enough
foresight
to
bring
any
actual
camping
gear
so
we
looked
for
natural
shelter
We
saw
a
cave
at
the
bottom
of
a
small
waterfall
so
we
rappelled
about
30

Baldacci's
Political
Savvy
Maine
Governor
John
Baldacci
is
sending
a
gay
rights
bill
to
the
legislature
Unlike
previous
bills
though
this
one
will
not
go
before
the
voters
for
approval
by
referendum
Maine
voters
have
twice
rejected
similar
bills
So
why
is
the
governor
doing
this
now
Quite
simply
because
his
political
opponents
are
at
the
weakest
they've
ever
been
When
these
past
bills
were
brought
before
the
state
the
Maine
Christian
Civic
League
was
still
a
force
to
respect
The
League
was
able
to
marshall
opposition
to
the
previous
gay
rights
bills
and
get
voters
to
the
polls
when
the
time
came
Thanks
to
the
loose
lips
of
Michael
Heath
and
the
refusal
of
the
MCCL's
board
to
fire
the
executive
director
the
organization
has
lost
a
great
deal
of
clout
both
in
the
legislature
and
with
the
churches
that
once
provided
a
strong
base
of
support
Baldacci
showed
a
great
deal
of
political
smarts
in
waiting
for
the
League
to
self-destruct
before
making
his
move
to
pass
a
gay
rights
bill
Heath
and
his
dwindling
supporters
are
left
with
one
issue
opposition
to
what
they
call
the
homosexual
lobby
Like
Democrats
during
last
year's
election
the
League
has
become
an
oppositional
movement
rather
than
an
idea-generating
one
As
Zell
Miller
said
about
John
Kerry
against
against
against
If
the
League
wants
to
survive
it
will
come
up
with
alternative
policy
proposals
on
a
variety
of
issues
that
concern
Christians
instead
of
focusing
on
the
one
issue
that
incites
more
emotion
than
good
political
sense

I
have
never

of

state
A
Houston
radio
station
is
offering
to
give
press
credentials
to
any
blogger
that
wants
them
to
keep
the
McCain-Feingold
legislation
from
limiting
the
role
blogs
play
in
the
country's
politics
H/T
Instapundit
That
such
restrictions
are
even
being
contemplated
by
our
government
is
outrageous
We
will
fight
any
attempt
to
impose
them
And
we
believe
we
may
have
a
unique
role
to
play
in
the
battle
ahead
LoneStarTimes.com
is
affiliated
with
KSEV

AM
an
independently
owned
talk-radio
station
in
Houston
TX
As
such
we
believe
that
we
enjoy
the
broadcast
exemption
that
prohibits
the
federal
government
from
regulating
our
speech
in
the
manner
they
are
proposing
for
mere
citizen
bloggers
While
we
still
need
to
talk
to
some
sharp
lawyers
and
nail
down
the
details
if
these
restrictions
come
to
pass
KSEV
and
LST
are
committed
to
working
out
a
legally
sound
way
in
which
individual
bloggers
of
every
ideological
persuasion
and
partisan
affiliation
can
somehow
register
with
us
and
be
credentialed
as
a
press
representative
of
KSEV
and
LST.I
personally
believe
that
civil
disobedience
of
a
sort
is
a
good
response
to
this
power-grab
on
the
part
of
the
Senators
I'm
not
a
huge
blogger
and
would
likely
be
ignored
by
the

So
I'm
going
to
join
a
lot
of
others
and
just
keep
blogging
This
regulation
of
internet
speech
has
nothing
to
do
with
money
in
politics
It's
about
power
and
giving
the
government
the
ability
to
regulate
speech
they
don't
like
or
agree
with
I
hope
other
radio
stations
follow
the
KSEV
model
and
start
offering
press
credentials
to
those
who
want
them
I
also
hope
bloggers
of
all

beliefs
take
KSEV
up
on

This
isn't

John
McCain-Feingold
is
coming
to
the
blogsophere
FEC
Commissioner
Bradley
Smith
says
there
is
action
pending
to
regulate
use
of
the
Internet
by
campaigns
According
to
Smith
Senators
McCain
and
Feingold
have
argued
that
we
have
to
regulate
the
Internet
that
we
have
to
regulate
e-mail
They
sued
us
in
court
over
this
and
they
won.The
regulations
would
be
on
use
of
information
from
a
campaign
or
linking
to
a
campaign
In
other
words
promoting
a
candidate
as
many
of
us
did
with
Polipundit's
Wictory
Wednesday
would
be
illegal
because
we
asked
people
to
donate
to
or
volunteer
for
the
Bush
campaign
There
have
been
very
few
times
when
the
right
and
left
sides
of
the
blogosphere
have
agreed
on
a
particular
issue

Kos
and
Oliver
Willis
have
just
as
much
to
lose
as
Blogs
for
Bush
if
McCain
and
Feingold
get
their
way
The
regulation
of
internet
speech
will
effectively
end
McCain's
chances
for
the
Republican
nomination
in
2008
GOP
voters
are
among
the
most
loyal
readers
of
blogs
and
recognize
the
vital
role
they
played
in

Why
Vote
Republican
Again
If
Congressional
Republicans
keep
up
their
defeatist
attitudes
about
the
president's
agenda
2006
is
going
to
be
a
very
bad
year
A
lot
of
people
worked
very
hard
last
year
to
re-elect
President
Bush
and
to
keep
and
increase
a
Republican
majority
The
Coalition
of
the
Spineless
in
the
House
and
Senate
have
chosen
to
pay
back
that
hard
work
with
capitulation
on
a
scale
that
would
make
the
French
jealous
If
Congressional
Republicans
don't
want
to
fight
for
the
issues
that
led
so
many
of
us
to
vote
for
them
last
year
why
should
we
fight
for
them
next
year
Republican
leaders
talk
confidently
of
the
62
million
voters
that
went
to
the
polls
for
Bush
in
November
The
assumption
is
obviously
that
those
voters
will
be
there
again
in
November
2006
Conservatives
should
let
Bill
Frist
Dennis
Hastert
and
Tom
DeLay
know
that
our
votes
should
not
be
taken
for
granted
We
didn't
turn
out

Line
Senator
Ted
Stevens
wants
cable
television
and
radio
to
be
subject
to
the
same
rules
as
broadcast
proving
that
rhetoric
can
be
dumb
and
scary
at
the
same
time
Cable
is
a
much
greater
violator
in
the
indecency
area
the
Alaska
Republican
told
the
National
Association
of
Broadcasters
which
represents
most
local
television
and
radio
affiliates
I
think
we
have
the
same
power
to
deal
with
cable
as
over-the-air
broadcasters.What
Senator
Stevens
is
calling
for
is
nothing
less
than
a
massive
expansion
of
federal
power
You
want
Republicans
to
start
losing
elections
Start
trying
to
regulate
private
entertainment
choices
and
violating
basic
conservative
principles
Now
I'm
a
religious
conservative
who
thinks
broadcast
networks
should
be
more
careful
in
what
they
put
on
the
air
but
also
believe
it's
the
responsibility
of
parents
to
ensure
that
kids
aren't
being
exposed
to
objectionable
material
When
it
comes
to
cable
or
pay
radio
though
government
should
just
stay
out
of
the
picture
I'm
just
libertarian
enough
to
believe
that
people
should
be
allowed
to
watch
what
they
want
if
they
are
willing
to
pay
for
the
privilege
I
may
not
like
Howard
Stern
or
programs
with
profanity
and
nudity
but
my
disapproval
does
not
give
me
the
right
to
determine
what
others
may
watch
After
all
where
do
you
stop
People
sometimes
swear
in
the
Harry
Turtledove
book
I'm
reading
Does
that
mean
I
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
buy
it
Does
Senator
Stevens
want
to
create
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Keeping
Dirty
Cussin
Out
of
Books
Senator
Stevens
is
attempting
to
impose
his
values
on
those
who
do
not
share
them
using
the
power
of
the
federal
government
It
used
to
be
that
conservatives
and
liberals
disagreed
on
the
extent
of
federal
power
Now
the
only
area
of
disagreement
seems
to
be
when
it
should
be
used

Think
the
Maine
Christian
Civic
League
is
a
reasonable
organization
interested
in
working
with
legislators
Think
again
The
lack
of
respect
shown
the
legislator
willing
to
answer
the
League's
questions
in
good
faith
is
appalling
It
shows
that
the
problem
with
the
MCCL
goes
much
deeper
than
Michael
Heath
The
entire
organization
is
dysfunctional
The
MCCL
gets
most
of
its
support
from
churches
throughout
the
state
of
Maine
If
you're
a
Christian
who
lives
in
Maine
and
you're
tired
of
having
ineffective
representation
of
your
views
in
Augusta
check
this
list
to
see
if
your
church
supports
the
League
If
so
ask
your
pastor
or
board
of
elders
to
reconsider
support
for
the
MCCL
It's
become
obvious
that
Heath
and
the
organization
he
leads
are
unwilling
to
change
their
tactics
and
an
intervention
of
sorts
is
needed
Christians
need
to
be
involved
with
politics
but
in
a
way
that
is
effective
and
more
importantly
glorifies
Christ
Alienating
and
insulting
lawmakers
does
not
meet
either
of
these
criteria
The
League
needs
to
change
and
Christians
need
to
force
that
change
or
withhold
their
support
I
know
I've
been
rather
obsessive
about
this
in
recent
days
but
I
consider
this
issue
important
enough
to
warrant
multiple
posts
Christians
are
not
being
well-represented

iTunes
Gripe
I
love
iTunes
It's
a
fantastic
way
to
purchase
music
that
I
use
quite
often
It's
far
from
perfect
though
One
of
the
more
annoying
glitches
is
the
Album
Only
label
that
graces
some
songs
If
I
wanted
to
purchase
the
album
I
wouldn't
be
on
iTunes
in
the
first
place
the
appeal
is
the
ability
to
get
one
song
at
a
time
legally
For
some
reason
there
are
record
producers
that
insist
on
making
some
songs
unavailable
for
individual
purchase
That's
a
dumb
decision
If
people
who
use
iTunes
cannot
purchase
the
song
some
of
them
are
going
to
acquire
it
through
other
programs
in
a
way
that
doesn't

This
doesn't
mean
I'm
going
to
do
that
by
the
way
But
for
anyone
with

it's
an
easy
option

who

put
some

off-limits
should
realize

truth
the

people
you're
hurting

who

Heath
Clarification
In
my
previous
post
on
Michael
Heath
and
his
recent
editorial
it
may
have
seemed
as
though
I
was
calling
his
faith
into
question
I
meant
to
clarify
that
at
the
end
of
my
comments
but
ran
out
of
time
before
I
had
to
leave
for
the
evening
From
everything
I
know
about
Michael
Heath
he's
a
good
guy
who
loves
his
family
and
is
sincere
about
his
faith
I
simply
wish
he
would
give
up
his
position
of
leadership
as
a
speaker
for
those
of
faith
Not
because
he's
a
bad
guy
but
because
he's
lost
the
respect
of
those
he's
paid
to
lobby
and
those
he's
supposed
to
represent
If
Christians
want
to
be
effective
in
politics
they
have
to
have
a
compelling
message
and
a
spokesman
who
can
clearly
articulate
it
The
problem
with
the
focus
on
homosexuality
is
that
too
often
the
subject
is
treated
as
though
there
aren't
real
people
behind
the
rhetoric
As
I've
mentioned
before
I
have
gay
relatives
who
I
love
very
much
and
I'm
tired
of
seeing
Christians
treat
their
lives
as
talking
points
It
seems
as
though
gays
and
lesbians
have
become
convenient
scapegoats
to
focus
on
as
a
way
of
ignoring
the
real
problems
with
marriage
that
the
church
has
ignored
for
decades
There
are
issues
besides
homosexuality
that
could
use
the
attention
of
a
Christian
civic
organization
I
wish
the

had
political
leaders
with
enough
vision
to
see
them

Puppy-Kickin
Time
Mike
Heath
has
responded
to
his
critics
and
it
isn't
pretty
As
it
ran
in
the
Portland
Press
Herald
on
Thursday
February
17
2005
Some
Maine
columnists
are
disparaging
me
personally
and
belittling
my
Christian
beliefs
They
wrongly
assume
that
this
is
the
way
to
undermine
the
Christian
Civic
League's
work
against
the
homosexual
rights
movement
in
Maine
That
is
why
bitter
personal
attacks
and
ridicule
have
finally
come
to
the
forefront
Over
the
past
decade
the
League
has
more
than
once
successfully
opposed
the
agenda
of
the
homosexual
rights
movement
even
though
every
last
bastion
of
elitism
in
Maine
was
against
us
I
don't
think
this
success
is
attributable
to
my
charming
personality
or
my
quick
wit
It
is
attributable
to
the
force
of
the
ideas
we
have
offered
Last
time
I
checked
the
mission
statement
of
the
Maine
Christian
Civic
League
was
Bringing
a
Biblical
perspective
to
the
dialogue
over
public
policy
not
Fighting
the
gay
rights
agenda
24/7
Almost
every
League
statement
or
policy
proposal
in
the
past
few
years
has
been
about
homosexuality
Calling
it
an
obsession
of
Heath's
is
not
overstating
the
case
Check
this
site
and
how
many
of
the
articles
have
to
do
with
the
subject
Gee
Mike
I
can't
imagine
why
every
last
bastion
of
elitism
in
Maine
would
be
against
you
I
mean
how
does
something
like
that
happen
In
the
past
year
you've
threatened
to
out
legislators
and
accused
the
governor
of
having
one
of
those
imaginary
gay
genes
These
hardly
count
as
forceful
ideas
In
fact
they
sound
more
like
crude
personal
attacks
on
those
who
disagree
with
you
Ever
heard
the
saying
about
the
pot
and
the
kettle
Now
the
left
has
finally
exhausted
its
supply
of
arguments
and
deceptions
The
only
course
of
action
left
open
to
liberal
columnists
is
to
attack
me
personally
I
lead
an
organization
which
is
concerned
with
matters
of
right
and
wrong
so
words
like
evil
and
wrong
do
have
a
place
in
my
arguments
I
do
feel
outraged
at
times
and
angry
at
other
times
This
is
a
natural
reaction
for
anyone
who
sees
something
he
loves
being
harmed
And
I
do
feel
buoyant
and
youthful
on
occasion
when
I
see
the
truth
winning
out.What
you
lead
Mr
Heath
is
an
organization
that
bears
the
name
of
Christ
You
may
be
outraged
and
angry
at
what
people
are
saying
about
you
but
those
of
us
who
call
ourselves
Christians
often
feel
the
same
emotions
when
you
pretend
to
speak
in
our
name
or
in
the
Name
of
the
Savior
we
worship
I
don't
hate
anyone
nor
do
I
ridicule
or
revile
my
opponents
My
heart
aches
when
I
think
of
the
brokenness
I
see
in
homosexual
relationships.Threating
to
out
your
opponents
isn't
reviling
Saying
the
governor
has
a
gay
gene
isn't
ridiculing
Using
the
recent
mishap
of
the
governor
as
a
way
to
make
a
political
point
is
fair
game
You
and
I
obviously
have
a
different
sense
of
what
constitutes
ridicule
And
pardon
me
for
asking
but
just
what
the
heck
do
you
know
about
homosexual
relationships
We
can
debate
the
theological
disagreements
with
homosexuality
all
we
want
but
should
be
careful
not
to
disparage
the
actual
relationships
Focus
on
the
policy
implications
not
the
people
Hate
the
sin...you
know
the
rest
Someone
very
close
to
me
recently
told
me
about
riding
in
a
car
with
his
young
niece
a
little
girl
without
a
father
not
through
an
accident
or
a
broken
marriage
but
through
design
Her
mother
is
a
lesbian
The
little
girl
asked
my
friend
Is
it
OK
if
I
call
you
Daddy
If
your
heart
isn't
broken
by
this
you
had
better
see
a
minister
and
fast
or
better
yet
check
your
pulse
It
is
fascinating
to
me
that
this
entire
issue
can
be
reduced
so
easily
to
an
argument
over
one
person
me
by
so
many
otherwise
thoughtful
writers
in
Maine
They
seem
indifferent
about
the
future
of
families
in
Maine
preferring
instead
to
make
the
absurd
charge
that
I
hate
gays."Well
my
heart
isn't
broken
but
my
stomach
is
sure
doing
some
flops
Ugh
Can't
we
just
agree
as
conservatives
that
using
children
to
make
our
political
points
should
be
left
to
the
uh
left
I
agree
that
children
are
best
raised
by
a
mother
and
a
father
but
don't
you
think
some
sort
of
statistic
would
have
worked
better
here
I
repeat
ugh
And
I
don't
think
you
hate
gays
but
you
and
the
organization
you
lead
are
certainly
obsessed
with
them
To
those
on
the
left
this
isn't
about
hating
the
sin
and
loving
the
sinner
It's
substituting
personal
attacks
for
real
ideas
It
isn't
about
important
theological
and
philosophical
issues
It's
about
the
need
to
turn
a
blind
eye
towards
matters
of
right
and
wrong
truth
and
falsehood
And
this
debate
is
deeply
personal
for
all
of
us
The
left
is
hitting
closer
and
closer
to
more
and
more
homes.Uh...if
this
is
about
real
ideas
then
shouldn't
this
article
contain
some
of
them
Heath
is
trying
to
tell
us
what
his
political
oppents
believe
when
he
obviously
has
no
idea
what
they
actually
think
It's
not
that
liberals
believe
there
is
no
right
and
wrong
it's
that
they
have
chosen
to
redefine
those
terms
to
fit
a
particular
ideological
mold
Heath
doesn't
understand
his
opponents
When
Jesus
was
on
this
earth
He
would
engage
his
opponents
on
their
own
ground
using
their
own
language
Heath
is
trying
to
speak
the
language
of
mainstream
evangelical
belief
into
the
secular
policy
world
and
wondering
why
no
one
is
listening
to
him
If
he
wants
to
make
a
difference
he
should
learn
the
language
We
have
some
very
serious
work
to
do
on
the
issue
of
human
sexuality
If
we
do
not
we
are
going
to
lose
this
civilization
Part
of
being
human
is
to
make
a
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
Philosophers
call
this
the
ethical
fact
All
cultures
have
done
this
up
to
now
except
our
own
a
culture
in
which
liberals
have
gained
the
upper
hand
They
have
decided
to
place
sex
in
a
special
category
where
nothing
is
right
or
wrong.Oh
give
me
a
break
Lose
this
civilization
Criminy
Could
we
cool
the
rhetoric
just
a
bit
Do
I
think
gay
marriage
is
an
issue
that
needs
to
be
debated
Yes
Do
I
think
gay
marriage
if
passed
would
cause
the
United
States
to
collapse
into
a
heaping
pile
of
immoral
rubble
No
Shrillness
doesn't
work
Just
ask
John
Kerry
His
dour
pronouncements
about
the
Bush
administration
didn't
square
with
what
most
people
saw
around
them
A
lot
of
people
in
Maine
know
someone
who
is
gay
or
lesbian
and
don't
see
them
as
civilization-destroying
fiends
Instead
we
see
them
as
friends
brothers
sisters
aunts
uncles
parents
etc
Acknowledging
this
wouldn't
be
hard
but
Heath
isn't
interested
He
would
rather
preach
to
the
choir
who
believes
as
he
does
But
allow
me
to
ask
a
simple
question
Wouldn't
it
be
better
for
all
involved
if
we
maintained
our
traditional
understanding
of
marriage
and
the
family
Every
lesbian
or
gay
man
longs
for
a
loving
mother
and
father
Every
mother
and
father
wants
to
build
a
family
that
gives
them
grandchildren
Why
aren't
we
creating
a
society
with
policies
laws
and
beliefs
that
support
this
obvious
truth
Instead
we
want
to
violate
common

ignore
the
lessons
of

toss
out
customs
and
laws
that
stretch
back
thousands

place
sodomy

Scare

The
word
sodomy
bad
If
Heath
is
trying
to
convince
people
of
his
point
of
view
he's
doing
a
terrible
job
Remember
what
I
said
earlier
about
speaking
his
own
language
That's
exactly
what's
going
on
here
Heath
refuses
to
moderate
his
rhetoric
alienating
those
who
might
be
inclined
to
agree
with
him
Where
is
the
logic
in
this
Perhaps
Bill
Nemitz
can
explain
it
to
you
I
can't
It
is
a
form
of
social
insanity
with
roots
that
are
deep
and
wide
There
is
only
one
solution
and
that
is
for
Christians
to
speak
and
act
like
Christians.Okay
How's
this
Instead
speaking
the
truth
in
love
we
will
in
all
things
grow
up
into
him
who
is
the
Head
that
is
Christ
Or
this
To
love
him
with
all
your
heart
with
all
your
understanding
and
with
all
your
strength
and
to
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
is
more
important
than
all
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
But
maybe
you'd
rather
go
on
about
gay
genes
and
the
sexual
orientation
of
legislators
That
means
no
pornography
It
is
wrong
It
means
no
sex
outside
of
marriage
That
is
wrong
too
That
means
divorce
only
in
the
case
of
adultery
and
even
then
it
must
be
discouraged.Hey
other
issues
What
a
concept
Too
bad
it's
only
cursory
Christians
need
to
be
Christian
What
else
will
they
be
From
what
historic
and
durable
set
of
ideas
will
we
derive
our
values
The
Religion
and
Values
pages
of
the
Portland
Press
Herald?Yes
Christians
need
to
be
Christian
And
organizations
that
bear
the
name
of
the
Savior
need
to
have
higher
standards
of
behavior
and
rhetoric
than
has
been
shown
thus
far
by
the
leadership
of
the
Maine
Christian
Civic
League
Remember
who
you
are
Do
we
even
care
I
hope
so
Indeed
I
pray
so
The
little
girls
and
boys
of
the
future
are
all
going
to
want
mommies
and
daddies
They
are
already
calling
for
them
you
know.End
with
the
appeal
to
emotion
It's
a
good
fundraising
tactic
but
a
poor
debating
point
The
MCCL
is
an
organization
with
no
clout
and
no
future
If
it
wants
to
survive
it
should
start
expanding
its
focus
and
look
at
other
issues
that
impact
Christians
in
Maine
It
should
also
consider
a
change
in
leadership
So
far
it
has
shown
an
unwillingness
to
do
either
If
it
continues
on
its
present
all
gay
all
the
time
course
then
it
will
and
deserves
to
fade
from
the
Maine
political
landscape

Same

Different

This
weekend
the
Camden
Conference
was
held
in
Maine
The
subject
was
the
Middle
East
The
Portland
Press
Herald
decided
to
cover
the
entire
event
and
their
headline
reads
Mideast
dialogue
comes
to
Camden
The
BDN
decided
it
would
focus
entirely
on
General
Anthony
Zinni's
remarks
Retired
general
critiques
U.S
policy
in
Iraq
The
BDN
story
isn't
particularly
well-written
leaving
me
wondering
what
the
heck
Zinni
actually
said
and
looking
on
the
web
for
a
transcript
of
his
remarks
It
makes
the
conference
which
actually
seemed
pretty
interesting
look
like
nothing
more
than
a
long
weekend
of
U.S
foreign-policy
bashing
It
would
have
been
nice
for
the
local
paper
to
provide
an
actual
account
of
what
happened
at
the
conference
instead
of
a

consisting
entirely

cherry-picked

The
newest
journalist
to
use
the

as
victims
is
the
tiresome
Maureen
Dowd
from
the
New

Times
According
to
a
post
in
The
Corner
by
Jonah
Goldberg
Dowd
had
the
following
to
say
on
Meet
the
Press
And
look
at
us
and
we're
torturing
people
and
we're
outsourcing
torture
The
administration
is
trying
to
throw
journalists
in
jail
and
basically
trying
to
replace
the
whole
press
crew
with
ringers
including
male
escorts
I

even
Nixon
hated
the
press
but
he
never
tried
to
actually
do
an
Invasion
of
the

Snatchers
thing
with

So
as
Tom

pointed
out
it's

Pandora's

There
are
good

evil
spirits
that
we've
unleashed.Yes
Pandora's
Box
has
been
opened
but
it
wasn't
the
Bush
administration
who
opened
it
The
imminent
jailing
of
reporters
is
a
direct
result
of
the
press
uncritical
acceptance
of
the
stories
told
by
Joseph
Wilson
The
MSM
ran
with
this
story
before
all
the
facts
were
known
and
called
for
an
independent
counsel
One
was
appointed
and
has
demanded
these
reporters
give
up
their
sources
The
reporters
have
refused
obstructing
the
investigation
As
is
her
practice
Dowd
is
trying
to
stuff
facts
into
the
narrow
confines
of
her
biases
and
using
outdated
comparisons
to
make
her
point
It's

Why
I
Won't
Be
Watching
the
Oscars
Well
this
is
pretty
much
the
reason
After
having
the
ineffectiveness
of
their
middle-America
hatred
repudiated
so
thoroughly
at
the
polls
one
would
think
the
creative
geniuses
in
Hollywood
could
calm
their
vitriol
for
one
night
Guess
not
Even
before
I
read
this
story
though
the
Oscars
didn't
appeal
to
me
Mostly
because
I'm
not
a
big
fan
of
the
out-of-touch
self-congratulatory
celebrities
that
will
populate
tonight's
ceremony
Just
before
the
inauguration
liberals
spent
a
lot
of
time
asking
whether
the
president
should
spend
40
million
on
the
festivities
when
there
is
so
much
pain
and
suffering
in
the
world
A
similar
question
could
be
asked
of
these
celebrities
How
much
has
been
spent
on
the
gowns
the
jewels
the
gift
bags
Personally
I
don't
care
Unlike
bitter
leftists
who
wanted
to
deny
the
president
a
celebration
of
his
second
term
I
don't
begrudge
Hollywood
their
celebration
As
a
big
believer
in
capitalism
I'm
glad
the
economy
has
been
stimulated
with
the
amount
spent
tonight
In
addition
to
the
reasons
I've
listed
I
also
find
the
ceremony
boring
no
matter
who
hosts
So

What
Economic
Growth
Today
the

came
out
The
economy
grew
3.8
percent
That
is
very
good
economic

Now
try

It's

So
I
scrolled
down

looked

Nope
not

So

Not

not

it

Does
the
Senate
GOP
Go
McClellan
or
Grant
if
Harry
Reid
Goes
Gingrich
Hugh
Hewitt
asks
another
question
for
bloggers
to
consider
Harry
Reid
has
threatened
to
shut
down
all
Senate
business
if
the
Republicans
change
the
rules
on
filibustering
nominees
to
the
federal
judiciary
the
nuclear
option
There
are
two
possible
responses
to
it
One
is
the
McClellan
route
constantly
threatening
to
do
something
while
preparing
This
is
the
route
Senate
Majority
Leader
Bill
Frist
has
taken
thus
far
Then
there's
the
approach
of
Grant
total
warfare
Although
I
wish
the
impasse
over
judges
could
be
resolved
without
the
so-called
nuclear
option
I
think
it's
time
to
start
using
the
mandate
Republicans
were
given
in
the
last
election
So
it's
Grant
The
timidity
on
the
part
of
the
Congressional
Republicans
is
distressing
Not
nearly
enough
of
them
are
in
the
trenches
fighting
for
the
ideals
that
won
them
the
last
election
As
a
lot
they
seem
more
nervous
about
what
the
media
might
say
about
them
than
pushing
forward
an
agenda
During
the
Civil
War
General
Grant
was
subjected
to
withering
criticism
for
the
way
he
led
his
troops
He
was
called
a
drunkard
and
a
butcher
because
so
many
Union
troops
were
dying
in
his
aggressive
assaults
on
the
Confederate
army
If
he
had
listened
to
the
critics
the
war
may
well
have
dragged
on
for
many
more
months
or
years
Grant
knew
though
that
the
only
way
to
reunite
the
union
was
to
win
the
war
and
the
only
way
to
win
the
war
was
to
fight
And
he
fought
If
Republicans
take
the
Grant
approach
they
are
going
to
be
criticized
by
the
MSM
The
Democrats
are
going
to
raise
heck
and
those
cries
will
be
amplified
by
the
media
What
Republicans
need
to
remember
is
that
the
MSM
isn't
the
only
game
in
town
these
days
If
they
fight
they
will
inspire
the
base
and
the
bloggers
to
fight
with
them
And
it's
a
fight
we
can
win
The
defeat
of
Tom
Daschle
proves
that
on
the
debate
over
judicial
nominees
the
Democrats
have
the
losing
hand
The
battle
for
the
federal
judiciary
is
the
most
important
political
issue
of
our
time
Decisions
made
by
judges
can
have
long-lasting
effects
on
our
society
Voters
understand
this
which
is
why
so
many
of
them
showed
up
on
election
day
If
the
Republicans
refuse
to
fight
on
this
issue
it
will
throw
cold
water
on
the
enthusiasm
of
everyone
who
worked
so
hard
to
put
them
in
office
We
fought
for
you
guys
Now
please
return
the
favor

didn't

Then
I
read
this
story
linked
from
Instapundit
by
the
president
of
the
American
Library
Association
Wow
A
blog
is
a
species
of
interactive
electronic
diary
by
means
of
which
the
unpublishable
untrammeled
by
editors
or
the
rules
of
grammar
can
communicate
their
thoughts
via
the
web."Unpublishable
If
I
were
an
academic
I
would
be
gasping
for
air
and
sputtering
at
this
point
This
is
the
most
heinous
insult
in
academia
where
publish
or
perish
is
the
rule
But
I'm
not
an
academic
so
I
just
found
it
kind
of
a
non
sequitur
Untrammeled
by
editors
I
see
this
is
going
to
be
the
major
criticism
of
those
who
don't
understand
blogging
We're
rogue
agents
uncontrolled
in
our...what
Generation
of
debate
Communication
of
ideas
Isn't
that
a
good
thing
or
the
rules
of
grammar
Yes
there
is
some
painfully
bad
grammar
on
the
web
I'll
give
him
partial
points
on
this
one
But
there
are
also
those
of
us
who
have
a
familiarity
with
Strunk
and
White
William
Safire
and
various
stylebooks
But
my
grammar
isn't
always
good
I
have
a
passive
voice
problem
Though
it
sounds
like
something
you
would
find
stuck
in
a
drain
the
ugly
neologism
blog
is
a
contraction
of
web
log
Until
recently
I
had
not
spent
much
time
thinking
about
blogs
or
Blog
People."Something
you
would
find
stuck

drain
Heh
That's
actually
pretty
good
Blog
People
though
Ugh
So
he
hasn't
had
much
experience
with
bloggers
Well
thanks
to
this
piece
he's
about
to
get
some
I
had
heard
of
the
activities
of
the
latter
and
of
the
absurd
idea
of
giving
them
press
credentials
though
since
the
credentials
were
issued
for
political
conventions
they
were
just
absurd
icing
on
absurd
cakes
I
was
not
truly
aware
of
them
until
shortly
after
I
published
an
op-ed
piece
in
the
Los
Angeles
Times
Google
and
God's
Mind
December
17
2004
Then
thanks
to
kind
friends
with
nothing
but
my
welfare
in
mind
I
rapidly
learned
more
about
the
blog
subcultures
My
piece
had
the
temerity
to
question
the
usefulness
of
Google
digitizing
millions
of
books
and
making
bits
of
them
available
via
its
notoriously
inefficient
search
engine
The
Google
phenomenon
is
a
wonderfully
modern
manifestation
of
the
triumph
of
hope
and
boosterism
over
reality
Hailed
as
the
ultimate
example
of
information
retrieval
Google
is
in
fact
the
device
that
gives
you
thousands
of
hits
which
may
or
may
not
be
relevant
in
no
very
useful
order
Here
we're
presented
with
a
very
odd
contradiction

president
of
a
library
association
is
decrying
how
easy
it
is
to
retrieve
information
Information
shouldn't
be
available
to
the
masses
It
should
stay
safely
ensconced
in
a
library
where
people
like
Gorman
can
choose
what
books
to
put
on
the
shelves
I
do
like
the
idea
of
being
in
a
subculture
though
Maybe
I
should
get
a
tattoo
and
buy
a
motorcycle
jacket
Those
characteristics
are
ignored
and
excused
by
those
who
think
that
Google
is
the
creation
of
God's
mind
because
it
gives
the
searcher
its
heaps
of
irrelevance
in
nanoseconds
Speed
is
of
the
essence
to
the
Google
boosters
just
as
it
is
to
consumers
of
fast
food
but
as
with
fast
food
rubbish
is
rubbish
no
matter
how
speedily
it
is
delivered.Funny
considering
the
first
hit
I
got
after
typing
Michael
Gorman
into
a
search
engine
was
his
website
When
I
type
The
Prince
into
Google
I
get
this
and
quickly
When
I
type
US
Constitution
I
get
this
Has
Gorman
ever
actually
used
Google
I
mean
it's
a
search
engine
for
crying
out
loud
Sure
sometimes
it
gives
you
crap
results
You
just
have
to
refine
the
search
In
the
eyes
of
bloggers
my
sin
lay
in
suggesting
that
Google
is
OK
at
giving
access
to
random
bits
of
information
but
would
be
terrible
at
giving
access
to
the
recorded
knowledge
that
is
the
substance
of
scholarly
books
I
went
further
and
came
up
with
the
unoriginal
idea
that
the
thing
to
do
with
a
scholarly
book
is
to
read
it
preferably
not
on
a
screen
It
turns
out
that
the
Blog
People
or
their
subclass
who
are
interested
in
computers
and
the
glorification
of
information
have
a
fanatical
belief
in
the
transforming
power
of
digitization
and
a
consequent
horror
of
and
contempt
for
heretics
who
do
not
share
that
belief.Wow
This
sounds
like
the
full-throated
rant
of
a
guy
who
googled
his
own
name
and
was
disappointed
at
what
he
found
What
I'm
not
in
this
search
engine
thingy
Well
then
it's
useless
And
I
agree
with
him
about
books
for
me
the
computer
screen
will
never
replace
the
feeling
of
opening
the
cover
of
a
book
I've
never
read
before
Those
who
get
their
information
entirely
from
the
computer
are
missing
out
on
this
feeling
I
think
Of
course
rather
than
share
that
feeling
and
inspire
others
toward
it
Gorman
insults
his
readers
Nice
guy
How
could
I
possibly
be
against
access
to
the
world's
knowledge
Of
course
like
most
sane
people
I
am
not
against
it
and
after
more
than
40
years
of
working
in
libraries
am
rather
for
it
I
have
spent
a
lot
of
my
long
professional
life
working
on
aspects
of
the
noble
aim
of
Universal
Bibliographic
Control
a
mechanism
by
which
all
the
world's
recorded
knowledge
would
be
known
and
available
to
the
people
of
the
world
My
sin
against
bloggery
is
that
I
do
not
believe
this
particular
project
will
give
us
anything
that
comes
anywhere
near
access
to
the
world's
knowledge.So
if
we
can't
have
all
of
the
world's
knowledge
we
should
get
none
of
it
What
Google
and
the
Internet
provide
is
more
access
not
total
access
There's
a
lot
of
knowledge
in
the
world
and
a
network
of
interconnected
computers
seems
a
pretty
good
way
to
store
and
distribute
it
Or
at
least
a
good
beginning
It
is
obvious
that
the
Blog
People
read
what
they
want
to
read
rather
than
what
is
in
front
of
them
and
judge
me
to
be
wrong
on
the
basis
of
what
they
think
rather
than
what
I
actually
wrote
Given
the
quality
of
the
writing
in
the
blogs
I
have
seen
I
doubt
that
many
of
the
Blog
People
are
in
the
habit
of
sustained
reading
of
complex
texts
It
is
entirely
possible
that
their
intellectual
needs
are
met
by
an
accumulation
of
random
facts
and
paragraphs
In
that
case
their
rejection
of
my
view
is
quite
understandable.Gorman
would
do
well
to
remember
the
adage
that
you
attract
more
flies
with
honey
than
vinegar
Rather
than
explain
the
appeal
of
libraries
he's
decided
it's
more
effective
to
call
his
critics
dolts
This
intemperate
paragraph
shows
more
than
anything
else
in
this
piece
the
weakness
of
Gorman's
position
If
the
best
he
can
summon
is
crude
insults
then
it's
clear
he's
more
interested
in
lashing
out
than
finding
common
ground
with
those
who
share
his
thirst
for
knowledge
Bloggers
are
obviously
interested
in
ideas
or
we
wouldn't
spend
so
much
time
each
day
sharing
our
thoughts
and
reading
those
of
others
At
least
two
of
the
blog
excerpts
sent
to
me
each
written
under
pseudonyms
come
from
self-proclaimed
conservatives
which
I
find
odd
because
many
of
the
others
come
from
people
who
call
me
a
Luddite
and
are
presumably
technology-obsessed
progressives
The
Luddite
label
is
because
my
mild
remarks
have
been
portrayed
as
those
of
someone
worried
about
the
job
security
of
librarians
I
am
not
rather
than
one
who
has
a
different
point
of
view
on
the
usefulness
of
this
latest
expression
of
Google
hubris
and
vast
expenditure
of
money
involved.Note
the
scare
quotes
around
the
word
conservatives
Egad
That
was
rather
unnecessary
Do
I
use
a
pseudonym
No
Are
psuedonyms
always
bad
Well
perhaps
Gorman
can
seek
knowledge
in
the
works
of
George
Orwell
Mark
Twain
or
Daniel
Defoe
Or
as
they
were
probably
known
by
their
friends
Eric
Blair
Samuel
Clements
and
Daniel
Foe
I
don't
think
Gorman
is
a
Luddite
at
all
I
share
his
views
that
digital
information
cannot
replace
the
amazing
resource
that
is
a
local
library
I
don't
want
libraries
to
become
obsolete
but
also
think
that
the
advent
of
digital
technology
provides
a
way
to
get
past
the
filter
that
exists
at
so
many
libraries
What
is
the
filter
Well
the
librarians
The
filter
that
orders
multiple
copies
of
books
by
Michael
Moore
but
only
one
copy
of
every
book
by
Ann
Coulter
And
that
was
just
a
quick
check
of
two
authors
on
opposite
sides
of
the
ideological
spectrum
Further
searches
would
likely
lead
to
other
instances
of
this
And
it
happens
in
the
digital
world
as
well
I
link
to
conservative
or
libertarian
blogs
because
that's
where
I
happen
to
visit
and
read
Like
anyone
I
read
what
I
agree
with
The
difference
between
me
and
Michael
Gorman
is
that
I
admit
my
biases
The
ALA
does
not
If
a
fraction
of
the
latter
were
devoted
to
buying
books
and
providing
librarians
for
the
library-starved
children
of
California
the
effort
would
be
of
far
more
use
to
humanity
and
society
Perhaps
that
latter
thought
will
reinforce
the
opinion
of
the
Blog
Person
who
included
Michael
Gorman
is
an
idiot
in
his
reasoned
critique
because
no
opinion
that
comes
from
someone
who
is
antidigital
in
the
words
of
another
Blog
Person
could
possibly
be
correct
For
the
record
though
I
may
have
associated
with
Antidigitalists
I
am
not
and
have
never
been
a
member
of
the
Antidigitalist
party
and
would
be
willing
to
testify
to
that
under
oath
I
doubt
even
that
would
save
me
from
being
burned
at
the
virtual
stake
or
at
best
being
placed
in
a
virtual
pillory
to
be
pelted
with
blogs
Ugh!Ugh
indeed
Should
a
blogger
have
called
Gorman
an
idiot
No
But
how
is
that
different
in
tone
from
Gorman's
earlier
comment
I
doubt
that
many
of
the
Blog
People
are
in
the
habit
of
sustained
reading
of
complex
texts
It's
really
not
One
just
uses
more
graceful
language
The
library
has
always
been
a
refuge
for
me
I
love
going
into
our
local
library
and
just
walking
through
the
stacks
I
love
the
feel
and
smell
of
books
and
the
thrill
of
starting
a
new
book
I
think
Google
and
the
internet
are
a
great
source
of
information
but
they
cannot
replace
the
complexity
of
a
book
Gorman
has
the
right
ideas
but
is
terrible
at
communicating
them
Note
how
at
the
end
he
resorts
to
the
language
of
the
oppressed
he's
finding
common
cause
with
witches
and
victims
of
McCarthy
It's
just
all
so
tired
And
this
is
from
someone
who
basically
agrees
with
the
guy
Gorman
will
likely
get
his
blog
attention
from
this
piece
but
he
will
not
influence
many
who
disagree
with
him
I
count
this
one
as
a
lost
opportunity
on
Gorman's
part
as
the
president
of
a
library
association
he
has
a
unique
voice
on
the
importance
of
libraries
and
the
wonder
of
the
written
word
But
he
squandered
it
with
his
retreat
into
academic
snobbery
and
elitism

Bill
Maher
Still
Not
Funny
The
smarmy
host
of
Real
Time
with
Bill
Maher
recently
went
into
a
rant
about
Christianity
and
religion
We
are
a
nation
that
is
unenlightened
because
of
religion
I
do
believe
that
I
think
that
religion
stops
people
from
thinking
I
think
it
justifies
crazies
I
think
flying
planes
into
a
building
was
a
faith-based
initiative
I
think
religion
is
a
neurological
disorder
They
don't
have
to
be
evangelical
but
they're
religious
They
believe
in
religion
which
as
I
think
it
was
Jesse
Ventura
who
had
that
quote
about
religion
is
a
crutch
for
weak-minded
people
who
need
strength
in
numbers.Yup
I'm
a
regular
wallflower
who
can't
be
without
the
soothing
environment
provided
by
my
fellow
weak
minded
Christians
I
would
love
to
be
able
to
go
into
a
full-throated
rant
about
Maher
and
his
comments
but
I
just
don't
have
it
in
me
Partially
because
it's
late
and
I'm
finally
starting
to
get
tired
but
more
because
I
just
feel
sorry
for
Maher
Could
you
imagine
going
through
life
that
angry
I
used
to
watch
Maher's
show
and
often
wondered
one
thing
above

Checking
Up
on
the
League
I
recently
heard
a
speaker
at
church
who
mentioned
the
Christian
Civic
League
of
Maine
so
I
decided
to
visit
their
website
The
League
has
lost
a
great
deal
of
political
clout
over
the
past
few
years
thanks
to
the
uncontrolled
mouth
of
its
executive
director
Michael
Heath
and
the
refusal
of
the
organization's
board
to
fire
him
If
you
look
over
the
League's
online
daily
newspaper
you'll
see
a
disturbing
trend
that
I've
mentioned
again
and
again
on
this
blog
as
something
of
an
obsession
with
evangelical
social
conservatives
homosexuality
This
is
the
issue
that
got
Heath
in
so
much
trouble
and
the
League's
single-minded
focus
on
it
will
likely
mean
the
end
of
what
was
once
a
fine
organization
How
obsessed
are
these
guys
with
gays
One
writer
even
took
the
recent
injury
of
our
governor
and
turned
it
into
a
post
about
how
men
were
meant
to
marry
women
Seriously
It
has
to
be
read
to
be
believed
these
guys
couldn't
just
wish
Governor
Baldacci
well
they
had
to
throw
in
a
little
lecture
It's
a
disturbing
display
of
ungraciousness
Personally
I
think
the
League
is
finished
as
a
political
force
in
the
state
and
will
close
its
doors
in
the
next
few
years
I
would
say
such
an
event
is
unfortunate
but
I
wouldn't
mean
it
Better
for
Maine
to
have
no
Christian
civic
organization
than
have
one
with
such
warped
priorities

test
for
bloggers

introduce
themselves

THE
WHO
THE
HELL
DO
YOU
THINK
YOU
ARE

Who
the
hell
do
you
think

college
newspaper
and
a
small
weekly
paper
here
in
Bangor
4
Do
you
even
read
newspapers
Every
day
5
Do
you
watch
any
other
news
than
FOX
News
propaganda
you
ignorant
fool
Yes
I
watch
the
local

fascist
Because
there's

uneducated

Hey

I

I
don't
want

since

regurgitating
and

have
dug
up

And
for

I
don't

I
blog

They
don't
have

they

no

holds
them
accountable
when
they
make
mistakes
or
flat
out
lie.If
I
remember
correctly
Bill
from
INDC
actually
interviewed
a
source
during
the
Dan
Rather

In
the
Eason
Jordan
story
other
bloggers
were
either
in
the
room
when
Jordan
made
his
comments
or
interviewed
people
who

We
may
not

as

grows
more
popular
as

Where
Your
Treasure
Is
My
friend
Joe
and
I
had
a
good
email
conversation
yesterday
about
the
nature
of
wealth
based
on
this
post
Lately
I've
been
struck
by
just
how
much
we
have
here
in
the
United
States
Joe
brought
up
a
good
saying
in
his
email
a
rich
man
eats
when
he
pleases
a
poor
man
eats
when
he
can
We
are
a
wealthy
country
Our
debates
over
the
haves
versus
have
nots
would
be
laughable
to
someone
living
in
other
countries
as
our
have
nots
are
sometimes
rich
compared
to
those
who
literally
have
nothing
I
realize
how
stupid
it
is
when
I
open
my
fridge
and
complain
that
there's
nothing
to
eat
Now
I'm
not
writing
this
to
sound
holier
than
thou
or
to
make
anyone
feel
guilty
for
what
they
have
The
wealth
of
the
United
States
is
a
blessing
and
a
curse
A
blessing
for
obvious
reasons
our
material
quality
of
life
is
among
the
highest
in
the
world
A
curse
because
that
wealth
can
distract
us
from
what's
really
important
our
relationships
with
other
people
and
the
need
we
all
have
for
a
relationship
with
God
I'm
writing
it
because
one
it's
my
blog
and
I
can
write
whatever
I
want
and
two
I
think
it's
important
to
recognize
the
responsibilities
our
weath
gives
us
To
whom
much
is
given
much
is
required
Americans
showed
their
generosity
after
the
tsunami
disaster
hit
southern
Asia
At
the
risk
of
sounding
like
Sally
Struthers
I
would
encourage

to
do

Defending
the
UN
The
secretary-general
of
the
United
Nations
Kofi
Annan
says
the
world
body
still
had
a
vital
role
to
play
in
today's
world
His
defense
of
the
organization
he
leads
is
unconvincing
The
article
runs
nearly
1600
words
Of
those
fewer
than
100
deal
with
the
oil-for-food
scandal
and
the
words
Annan
does
use
are
dismissive
He
calls
the
affair
overblown
and
blames
the
scandal
on
ethical
lapses
and
lax
management
Annan
spends
only
about
70
words
talking
about
the
allegations
of
sexual
abuse
made
by
refugees
in
the
Congo
Most
of
the
article
is
spent
trying
to
extol
the
virtues
of
the
United
Nations
That
Annan
feels
the
need
to
do
this
shows
just
how
tenuous
is
the
UN's
position
with
the
American
people
Glenn
Reynolds
recently
pointed
out
how
unpopular
the
UN
is
with
citizens
of
this
country
The
organization
is
in
danger
of
losing
its
moral
authority
assuming
of
course
that
it
hasn't
lost
it
already
Some
of
Annan's
arguments
simply
don't
make
sense
Take
for
instance
this
paragraph
on
Iraq
Even
the
scars
left
by
past
differences
can
be
turned
into
today's
opportunities
Precisely
because
the
United
Nations
did
not
agree
on
some
earlier
actions
in
Iraq
today
it
has
much
needed
credibility
with
and
access
to
Iraqi
groups
who
must
agree
to
join
in
the
new
political
process
if
peace
is
to
prevail
The
U.N
can
be
useful
because
it
is
seen
as
independent
and
impartial
If
it
ever
came
to
be
seen
as
a
mere
instrument
or
prolongation
of
U.S
foreign
policy
it
would
be
worthless
to
everyone.So
the
organization
that
fought
against
the
liberation
of
Iraqis
is
the
only
one
with
the
ability
to
ensure
the
success
of
their
future
democracy
The
UN
has
no
credibility
on
Iraq
because
it
did
everything
in
its
power
to
prevent
the
war
that
led
to
a
free
Iraq
Annan
even
called
the
war
a
violation
of
international
law
How
is
that
independent
or
impartial
So
what
does
Annan
propose
Well
after
spending
most
of
his
time
singing
the
virtues
of
the
UN
this
is
all
he
has
to
say
In
my
eight
years
as
secretary-general
I
had
already
done
a
lot
with
the
support
of
member
states
often
led
by
the
U.S
to
make
the
U.N
more
coherent
and
efficient
Now
we
need
to
make
it
more
transparent
and
accountable
not
only
to
diplomats
representing
member
governments
but
also
directly
to
the
public.And
that's
it
I
don't
disagree
with
Annan
here
but
think
he's
understating
the
degree
of
the
problem
with
the
UN
The
major
problem
isn't
that
the
UN
is
secretive
the
major
problem
is
that
it
is
a
democratic
organization
that
allows
anti-democratic
states
to
use
the
democratic
process
to
deny
democracy
to
their
people
In
the
UN
countries
led
by
fear
and
murder
get
just
as
much
say
in
the
General
Assembly
as
countries
led
by
the
consent
of
the
governed
It's
moral
equivalence
in
action
It
is
that
fact
which
makes
the
UN
such
a
deeply
dysfunctional
organization
What
Kofi
doesn't
realize
is
that
it's
not
recent
scandals
that
strip
the
UN
of
moral
authority
the
very
structure
of
the
organization
has
prevented
it
from
ever
possessing
it

are
declining

Good

My

not

because

Faith
and
Religion
One
of
the
subjects
most
often
covered
on
this
blog
is
the
interplay
between
religious
faith
and
political
action
For
my
most
current
thoughts
on
the
subject
here
is
a
column
I
wrote
for
The
Republican
Journal
in
Belfast
Maine
For
those
who
have
never
before
visited
this
blog
I
am
an
evangelical
Christian
whose
religious
beliefs
are
best
summed
up
by
my
home
church's
Statement
of
Faith
When
it
comes
to
politics
I
believe
it
is
the
duty
of
every
Christian
to
be
involved
in
politics
but
to
do
so
wisely
and
according
to
giftedness
One
of
the
most
visible
Christian
political
organizations
is
the
Family
Research
Council
a
branch
of
Focus
on
the
Family
The
website
is
quite
good
with
a
decent
list
of
legislative
priorities
for
the
organization
I
don't
know
the
exact
site
statistics
but
quite
a
few
Christians
visit
the
site
daily
A
good
way
to
get
an
idea
of
what
issues
are
important
to
the
FRC's
constituency
conservative
Christians
is
to
check
the
list
of
the
most
popular
articles
on
the
site
If
those
articles
are
any
indication
of
what
matters
most
to
evangelicals
the
results
are
not
encouraging
Most
Popular
Items
The
Bible
The

Staying
Faithful
To
MarriageFour
of
the
five
most
popular
articles
on
the
site
are
about
the
debate
regarding
marriage
and
homosexuality
One
of
the
FRC's
legislative
priorities
is
passage
of
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
a
piece
of
legislation
with
which
I
do
not
agree
I
was
pleased
when
the
president
expressed
doubt
about
its
passage
and
decided
not
to
spend
political
capital
on
the
issue
There
are
many
reasons
for
my
disagreement
with
the
FMA
Most
of
them
are
contained
within
the
articles
linked
Over
time
I've
developed
some
guidelines
for
Christian
political
involvement
that
I've
been
working
on
Here
is
a
rough
draft
of
my
thoughts
on
how
Christians
can
be
most
effective
in
politics
These
are
in
no
particular
order
The
only
issues
that
should
be
treated
as
life
or
death
are
those
that
actually
have
to
do
with
life
or
death
This
means
no
spending
vast
amounts
of
time
and
money
on
debates
having
to
do
with
school
prayer
the
Ten
Commandments
or
gay
and
lesbian
relationships
Our
passion
should
be
on
issues
where
there
are
actually
life
and
death
decisions
to
be
made
abortion
stem
cell
research
euthanasia
the
death
penalty
AIDS
human
rights
issues
These
are
not
easy
issues
to
deal
with
but
they
are
vital
Clean
your
house
or
it'll
be
cleaned
for
you
The
statistics
on
the
failure
rate
of
evangelical
marriages
is
appalling
Evangelicals
are
just
as
likely
to
divorce
as
non-evangelicals
We're
also
just
as
likely
to
live
together
before
getting
married
and
just
as
materialistic
A
recent
article
in
Christianity
Today
points
out
this
problem
and
it's
one
that
needs
serious
attention
If
evangelicals
are
going
to
try
to
change
society
we
have
to
have
a
handle
on
our
own
problems
first
Leaders
have
tried
to
frame
the
debate
over
the
FMA
as
protecting
marriage
Nice
try
but
if
that
was
the
case
then
evangelicals
would
be
just
as
irate
over
Britney
Spears
and
her
actual
50-hour
marriage
as
they
are
over
the
idea
of
gay
marriage
How
is
one
worse
than
the
other
Some
will
likely
be
offended
by
my
raising
these
issues
Get
used
to
it
as
the
debate
over
marriage
goes
on
the
media
and
political
opponents
will
do
much
worse
Sometimes
half
a
loaf
is
all
you're
going
to
get
Eat
while
you
can
As
I
say
in
the
Republican
Journal
column
Christians
are
notorious
for
demanding
we
get
our
way
or
threatening
to
bolt
from
politics
Instead
of
being
patient
with
the
legislative
process
Christians
look
for
grand
gestures
and
sweeping
legislation
Well
that
isn't
the
way
politics
works
Get
used
to
it
and
work
with
the
system
instead
of
against
it
Getting
elected
isn't
a
mandate
to
do
whatever
you
want
it's
a
gift
to
use
wisely
Even
if
you
don't
get
your
way
completely
bide
your
time
and
most
importantly
stay
involved
Because
if
Christians
get
out
of
politics
and
don't
vote
it
pretty
much
guarantees
that
we'll
end
up
with
people
that
will
do
very
little
we
agree
with
Discard
the
unelectable
or
just
plain
scary
no
matter
how
much
you
agree
with
them
Remember
Pat
Robertson
and
his
run
for
office
Or
Gary
Bauer
These
guys
were
ideologically
pleasing
to
Christians
so
they
got
Christian
support
Same
with
Roy
Moore
the
Ten
Commandments
judge
who
may
run
for
governor
of
Alabama
This
article
by
a
conservative
Christian
explains
well
why
Moore
should
not
run
and
why
even
those
who
agree
with
him
shouldn't
support
him
Sometimes
the
guy
that
agrees
with
you
on
everything
is
just
not
the
right
guy
for
the
job
You
may
have
to
put
up
with
some
ideological
disagreement
and
support
the
electable
guy
who
agrees
with
you
80
percent
instead
of
throwing
away
your
vote
on
an
also-ran
If
you
disagree
read
the
advice
about
the
loaf
again
Baby
steps
Sometimes
pragmatism
is
needed
Don't
try
to
ban
all
abortions
start
with
the
most
unpopular
and
chip
away
at
it
instead
of
going
for
the
big
kahuna
and
losing
So
far
the
president
seems
to
be
doing
this
well
and
the
FRC's
legislative
priorities
show
a
welcome
move
toward
this
process
Don't
be
stupid
Rebuke
those
who
are
Remember
when
Pat
Robertson
and
Jerry
Falwell
intimated
that
it
was
America's
sin
that
caused
the
terrorist
attacks
of
September
11
That
was
stupid
When
people
who
agree
with
you
make
public
gaffes
sometimes
it
requires
public
rebukes
or
corrections
Doing
this
will
help
others
understand
that
not
all
Christians/conservatives/Republicans
think
the
same
way
and
serve
as
a
correction
to
the
record
Sometimes
this
may
require
separating
oneself
from
certain
public
figures
Better
to
rid
the
party
of
the
extremists
than
allow
them
to
poison
the
well
Remember
Who
you
really
serve
Political
power
is
great
but
it's
not
why
we're
here
This
is
Don't
let
anything
you
do
in
politics
make
it
harder
to
accomplish
the
mission
Christ
gave
us
Those
are
a
few
of
my
thoughts
on
the
matter
Overall
I
think
involvement
in
the
political
process
is
absolutely
necessary
but
should
be
done
in
a
way
that
maximizes
the
political
clout
Christians
can
summon

Fraud
Protection
Act
Senator
Hillary
Clinton
has
many
very
bad
ideas
on
reforming
the
voting
system
and
one
very
good
idea
The
good
idea
is
to
let
ex-convicts
who
have
paid
their
debt
to
society
vote
Our
justice
system
is
built
on
the
idea
of
rehabilitation
not
punishment
Those
who
have
served
their
sentences
completely
and
are
not
on
probation
or
suspended
sentence
should
be
reintroduced
into
society
with
the
understanding
that
they
are
full
citizens
again
with
all
rights
intact
This
will
take
some
trust
on
the
part
of
society
but
I
believe
that
giving
ex-convicts
voting
rights
could
help
reduce
the
recidivism
rate
If
someone
has
served
their
sentence
gets
out
of
jail
and
is
still
denied
rights
they
are
de
facto
second-class
citizens
still
being
punished
for
crimes
they
committed
in
the
past
It's
wrong
and
should
be
changed
Visit
Justice
Fellowship
for
more
information
Since
Senator
John
Kerry
is
involved
in
this
effort
there
are
also
some
bad
ideas
Bad
idea
one
election
day
holiday
We
don't
need
a
new
federal
holiday
We
had
record
turnout
this
year
even
though
people
had
jobs
and
responsibilities
Bad
idea
two
making
it
harder
to
purge
voters
from
old
registration
lists
That
might
as
well
be
called
the
Fraud
Protection
Act
In
Seattle
the
names
of
dead
voters
were
used
to
cast
fraudulent
ballots
People
who
live
in
New
York
but
summer
in
Florida
have
admitted
they
vote
in
both
states
It
needs
to
be
easier
not
harder
to
purge
voters
Bad
idea
three
restricting
the
power
of
secretaries
of
state
The
presidential
election
is
a
series
of
50
state
elections
The
Constitution
makes
that
explicit
This
idea
violates
the
10th
amendment
and
is
simply
revenge
on
Katherine
Harris
and
Kenneth
Blackwell
Petty
and
illegal
a
twofer
I
love
this
part
of
the
story
Clinton
and
other
lawmakers
pointed
to
Al
Gore's
narrow
loss
in
Florida
and
John
Kerry's
defeat
by
118,000
votes
in
Ohio
both
states
where
Republicans
control
the
top
state
office
That's
not
the
way
a
great
country
runs
its
elections
Clinton
told
reporters.Which
part
The
fact
that
Republicans
happen
to
hold
the
state
offices
or
the
fact
that
you
guys
didn't
win
those
states
Criminy
Maybe
this
should
be
called
the

2005

has

his

as

The
President
Who
Hated

The
gentlemen
at

have
an
excellent
post
about
Jimmy
Carter
I'll
be
honest
I
don't
remember
the
Carter
administration
I
was
four
when
he
was
elected
My
first
political
memory
is
watching
Ronald
Reagan's
inauguration
on
television
Yes
I
was
eight
Yes
I
was
an
odd
kid
It
seems
Carter's
loss
to
President
Reagan
so
soured
him
on
this
country
that
he
has
turned
into
something
of
an
anti-American
crank
Contrast
his
behavior
after
the
election
with
that
of
former
President
Bush
A
lot
of
people
credit
Carter
with
good
deeds
because
he

I'm
not
as
easily
impressed

Cavorting
with
America's
enemies
during
an
election
year
is
not
endearing
behavior
to
me
His
acceptance
of
his
Nobel

No

Just

Cavuto's

He
said
there's
no

When
Cavuto
pressed
Schumer
to
explain
why
it
was
a

when

was

and
isn't

Schumer
said

didn't

Al-Jazeera

After

at
the
Al-Jazeera

on
My
Pet

I
decided
to
visit
the
English
website
of
the
Arabic
news

I
found
some
interesting

there
One
was
a
poll
Should
CNN's
Eason
Jordan
have
resigned
over
his
reported
remarks
accusing
the
US
of
targeting
journalists
in
Iraq
Yes
26
No
68
Unsure
6
Number
of
pollers
19116Not
much
surprise
there
Then
I
searched
for
Eason
Jordan
and
found
this
news
story
Al
Jazeera
mostly
reported
it
straight
until
the
end
when
they
used
the
story
as
an
opportunity
for
some
anti-American
propaganda
Speaking
to
Aljazeera
from
New

Dr
Fawaaz
Jajis
a
professor
of
political
science
at
University

said
there

in

The

Unfortunately
it
seems
that
the

Taliban
That
term
has
come
back
Referring
to
one's
political
opponents
as
the
American
Taliban
or
some
variant
of
the
term
was
popular
before
the
actual
Taliban
supported
a
guy
that
ended
up
killing
3,000
Americans
I
guess
MSNBC's
Mike
Moran
feels
it's
time
to
reintroduce
the
word
into
the
popular
culture
As
if
it
wasn't
enough
to
equate
people
at
their
computers
with
an
oppressive
regime
Moran
throws
in
some
more
nasty
words
But
should
Eason
Jordan
lose
his
job
for
this
Or
to
mine
the
deeper
shaft
here
was
it
wise
for
CNN
to
provide
the
enemies
of
free
expression
critical
thinking
and
The
First
Amendment
with
a
victory
on
this
count
Are
they
so
lost
as
a
network
that
they
abandon
basic
principles
Is
the
main
stream
really
now
just
a
trickling
tributary
that
can
be
diverted
with
just
a
few
well
thrown
stones?The
enemies
of
free
expression
critical
thinking
and
the
First
Amendment
Is
that
what
I
am
Wow
Let's
re-examine
that
First
Amendment
shall
we
Congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
or
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
or
the
right
of
the
people
peaceably
to
assemble
and
to
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances.Let's
see...religion
freedom
of
speech
of
the
press
right
of
the
people
to
assemble...nope
nothing
in
there
about
the
right
of
the
press
to
do
whatever
the
heck
they
want
without
being
held
to
account
As
I've
said
before
on
this
blog
journalists
have
a
particular
quirk
they
take
pride
in
the
fact
that
their
job
has
constitutional
protection
That's
not
the
quirk
though
The
effect
of
this
has
been
that
journalists
think
the
First
is
theirs
They
are
the
guardians
of
free
speech
and
according
to
Moran
the
only
ones
entitled
to
it
I
guess
I'm
curious
to
what
Moran
means
by
basic
principles
here
The
right
to
protect
ones
own
I
suppose
Then
Moran
quotes
an
email
by
CNN
president
Walter
Isaacson
It's
ironic
that
he
was
brought
down
partly
by
talk-show
and
blogging
folks
who
represent
the
opposite
approach
and
have
seldom...ventured
out
to
do...frontline
reporting."Arrogance
again
He
has
no
idea
who
the
bloggers
are
but
dismisses
them
anyway
Isaacson's
comments
are
like
a
blogger
full
employment
act
The
continuing
overconfidence
in
the
media
shows
that
we
will
likely
have
many
Jordans
to
deal
with
in
the
future
The
bigs
have
still
not
figured
out
the
new
playing
field
Moran's
column
is
a
whiny
rant
that
can
be
summed
up
with
the
three
words
most
often
heard
in

Screed
Alert
Sorry
folks
This
one
is
going
to
be
angry
As
the
lefty
bloggers
are
fond
of
pointing
out
they
got
Jeff
Gannon
The
former
Talon
News
reporter
quit
after
revelations
of
some
sort
were
made
about
his
past
But
getting
the
man
fired
wasn't
enough
they
now
seek
to
destroy
him
I'm
not
going
to
post
to
the
sites
in
question
because
I
don't
want
to
give
them
traffic
of
any
kind
but
if
Kos
Oliver
Willis
and
Ameriblog
had
any
shred
of
common
decency
they
would
step
back
from
their
current
actions
and
start
some
serious
self-loathing
These
intrepid
lefty
bloggers
are
now
making
gutter-ball
accusations
against
Gannon
accusing
him
of
being
a
gay
male
prostitute
and
tax
evader
These
are
serious
charges
for
which
they
do
seem
to
be
finding
some
degree
of
scant
evidence
Gannon
has
a
strange
background
and
perhaps
never
should
have
been
given
a
White
House
press
pass
But
that
doesn't
excuse
the
vicious
tearing
down
of
a
man
who
did
little
more
than
lob
some
softballs
at
the
president
or
his
press
secretary
once
in
awhile
The
venom
directed
at
Gannon
is
a
direct
result
of
the
absolute
total
blind
hatred
for
the
president
that
the
lefty
bloggers
have
Any
treatment
of
the
president
that
borders
on
the
friendly
is
considered
treason
in
their
eyes
Next
thing
you
know
they'll
be
going
after
Laura
Bush
for
kissing
her
own
husband
in
public
The
obsession
with
Gannon
only
proves
the
hollow
nature
of
their
victory
over
removing
him
from
the
press
pool
at
the
White
House
It's
finally
hit
them
that
while
they
got
Gannon
conservatives
have
done
much
more
So
they
continue
to
harp
on
the
story
finding
out
more
and
more
details
about
the
life
of
a
man
who
deserves
none
of
the
persecution
he's
getting
Their
behavior
is
beyond
reprehensible
They're
not
journalists
they're
little
boys
engaged
in
the
rhetorical
equivalent
of
pulling
the
wings
off
flies
and
burning
ants
with
a
magnifying
glass
It's
pain
not
facts
or
truth
that
these
malcontents
are
interested
in
Where
are
the
honest
liberals
the
ones
who
are
always
beating
up
on
conservatives
for
being
intolerant
and
engaging
in
witch
hunts
Where
are
the
liberals
asking
these
men
to
stop
persecuting
a
man
based
on
vague
rumors
of
homosexuality
Instead
of
criticism
we
get
hundreds
of
comments
on
each
Gannon
post
encouraging
the
bloggers
on
toward
more
and
more
character
assassination
pushing
these
men
lower
and
lower
into
the
swamps
of
their
own
disgusting
obsession
with
a
man
who
has
done
nothing
to

Professor

I

The
End
TKS
has
a
good
review
of
what
bloggers
should
do
now
that
Eason
Jordan
has
resigned
Personally
I
would
still
like
to
see
the
tape
but
it's
obvious
that
is
not
going
to
happen
anytime
soon
Ultimately
I
think
Jordan
was
probably
forced
out
of
his
position
by
those
hwo
know
that
CNN
has
already
been
hurt
by
Jordan's
op-ed
in
the
New
York
Times
and
by
its
slanted
reporting
during
the
election
Personally
I
think
the
media
knows
it
has
a
problem
with
bias
but
those
who
hold
positions
of
power
in
the
media
are
too
arrogant
to
care
Just
look
at
how
the
New
York
Times
responds
to
the
new
media
holding
the
old
media
accountable
They
are
afraid
of
the
change
that
blogs
bring
and
annoyed
at
the
ability
of
the
new
media
to
make
things
happen
using
the
power
of
information
momentum
Now
the
responsibility
of
the
new
media
is
to
use
the
power
we
have
on
stories
of
importance
we
can't
hold
the
MSM
accountable
just
because
we
don't
like
them
There
has
to
be
a
reason
and
a
cause
behind
the
actions

Eason's
Departure
Good
analysis
of
What
It
All
Means
at
National
Review
from
Jonah
Goldberg
and
TKS
It's
a
strange
feeling
having
played
a
very
small
part
in
this
very
big
story
I
think
the
real
hero
of
the
story
is
whoever
created
Google
Without
that
search
engine
and
the
ability
to
access
information
at
broadband
speeds
this
story
would
have
gone
nowhere
But
within
a
few
minutes
of
reading
Jordan's
comments
bloggers
around
the
country
were
able
to
go
online
and
find
numerous
instances
of
him
saying
the
same
sorts
of
things
The
MSM
will
doubtless
portray
bloggers
as
an
angry
mob
with
torches
and
pitchforks
storming
the
CNN
castle
and
demanding
blood
over
one
misguided
comment
But
it
was
the
unprecedented
access
to
news
stories
transcripts
and
speeches
that
allowed
bloggers
to
show
that
Jordan's
comments
were
not
a
moment
of
weakness
but
part
of
a
pattern
And
as
has
been
pointed
out
this
was
just
the
bloggers
The
MSM
ignored
this
story
almost
completely
The
balance
of
power
has
not
shifted
the
MSM
still
has
amazing
resources
and
reach
But
this
is
a
moment
where
anyone
who
had
a
part
to
play
knows
that
something
really
big
happened

Right

Of

what

was

that

Third
Ann

Fourth
Ann
is

journalist
who
often

And

Artists
Vs
Free
Speech
A
group
of
anti-war
artists
are
upset
with
the
Farnsworth
Museum
in
Rockland
for
displaying
the
work
of
Marine
Sgt
Michael
Fay
Fay's
art
is
based
on
his
experiences
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
During
the
preview
of
the
art's
exhibition
Fay
wore
his
uniform
and
had
a
discussion
with
protestors
We
are
fighting
an
illegal
and
immoral
war
Suzanne
Hedrick
73
of
Nobleboro
told
Fay
Without
another
viewpoint
without
the
faces
of
the
victims
and
the
ruining
of
the
country
I'm
deeply
concerned."Anyone
but
me
think
she'd
be
less
concerned
if
the
horrors
of
war
were
portrayed
without
a
positive
view
of
the
military
Then
there's
this
While
critical
of
his
subject
matter
the
protesters
also
were
upset
that
Fay
came
to
the
show
in
full-dress
uniform
They
said
it
indicated
that
he
was
on
official
business
and
promoting
war
The
fact
that
he
would
come
not
dressed
as
an
artist
but
as
a
Marine
is
an
affront
said
Natasha
Mayers
of
Whitefield
I'm
for
real
expression
that's
not
paid
for
This
guy
is
paid
for
he's
been
a
Marine
all
his
life
and
this
is
a
military
point
of
view
The
day-to-day
part
of
war
which
we
can't
imagine
is
what
we
need
to
see
We
need
to
see
images
that
tell
us
the
truth."This
of
course
begs
the
question
of
exactly
how
an
artist
dresses
Note
the
use
of
the
term
real
expression
Expression
not
paid
for
Hm
I
guess
this
means
artists
who
take
government
money
are
only
doing
the
bidding
of
the
Congress
or
the
President
Keep
this
story
in
mind
next
time
a
liberal
says
they
are
in
favor
of
free
speech
and
free
expression
of
ideas
or
the
next
time
you
hear
the
artistic
community
whining
about
a
crackdown
on
their
rights
because
someone
criticized
them
over
something
they
said
sang
or
painted
The
protestors
in
Rockland
had
every
right
to
stand
outside
the
Farnsworth
Museum
with
signs
and
slogans
They
had
every
right
to
engage
Sgt
Fay
in
debate
But
they
have
no
right
to
demand
their

The

Nik
Gowing
is
the
BBC
reporter
who
Chris
Cramer
and
Eason
Jordan
seem
to
have
gotten
much
of
their
evidence
from
It
seems
Mr
Gowing
has
a
habit
of
accusing
the
militaries
of
various
countries
of
targeting
journalists
A
nerve
in
our
business
may
just
have
snapped
Two
days
earlier
in
Southern
Lebanon
Abed
Takoush
another
name
known
only
in
the
news
business
was
killed
Takoush
was
driving
BBC
correspondent
Jeremy
Bowen
and
his
cameraman
Malek
Kenaan
a
Lebanese
freelance
working
for
Reuters
Takoush
was
still
inside
his
car
when
it
was
hit
by
an
Israeli
artillery
shell
Or
was
he
targeted
and
murdered
in
a
final
act
of
Israeli
military
spite?That
is
a
very
serious
accusation
to
throw
into
the
public
square
Where
is
Gowing's
evidence
Probably
hidden
in
the
same
place
Cramer
and
Jordan
keep
theirs
The
problem
goes
even
deeper
than
Gowing
Cramer
and
Jordan
though
Philip
Knightley
writing
in
the
Media
Guardian
says
the
following
Brigadier
General
Vince
Brooks
deputy
director
of
operations
has
told
us
the
Americans
do
not
target
journalists
But
some
war
correspondents
do
not
believe
him
and
Spanish
journalists
have
demonstrated
outside
the
US
embassy
in
Madrid
shouting
murderers
I
believe
that
the
traditional
relationship
between
the
military
and
the
media
one
of
restrained
hostility
has
broken
down
and
the
US
administration
has
decided
its
attitude
to
war
correspondents
is
the
same
as
that
set
out
by
President
Bush
when
declaring
war
on
terrorists
You're
either
with
us
or
against
us.'This
is
the
same
propaganda
Cramer
and
Jordan
have
been
mouthing
or
condoning

part

because

If

family
would
participate
in
the
Iraqi
elections
since
it
was
the
first
time
Iraqis
could
to
some
degree
elect

His
response
summed
it
all
Go

vote
and
risk
being
blown
into
pieces
or
followed
by
the
insurgents
and
murdered
for
cooperating
with
the
Americans
For
what
To
practice
democracy
Are
you
joking?"This
form

admits
early

that
he
rarely

If
Bret
Stephens

it's
no
wonder
he
had
a
negative
enough
view

Iraq
and
the
military
to
consider
Jordan's
comments
insignificant
They
were
pretty
tame
considering
what
Farnaz
Fassihi

him
By
the
way
if
this
is
how
reporters
felt
then
doesn't
that
tell
you
something
about
the

from
Iraq
This

observed
that

60-odd

killed
in

12
had
been
targeted
and
killed
by
coalition
forces
He
then
offered

who
had
been
tortured
for
weeks
at
Abu
Ghraib
made
to

of
targeting
journalists
Besides
he
said
the
American
generals
and
colonels
have
their
heart
in
the
right
place
By
this
point
one
could
almost
see
the
wheels
of
Mr
Jordan's
mind
spinning
slowly
How
am
I
going
to
get
out
of
this
one
But
Mr
Frank
and
others
kept
demanding
specifics
Mr
Jordan
replied
that
there
are
people
who
believe
there
are
people
in
the
military
who
have
it
out
for
journalists
He
also
recounted
a
story
of
a
reporter
who'd
been
sent
to
the
back
of
the
line
at
a
checkpoint
outside
of
Baghdad's
Green
Zone
apparently
because
the
soldier
had
been
unhappy
with
the
reporter's
dispatches.I
never
thought
I
would
say
this

thank
you

North
Korea
admits
it

Remember
how
proud
Madeleine
Albright
and
Bill
Clinton
were
of
their
accomplishment
there
Albright
on
North
Korea
and
the
Bush
administration
I
do
think
if
the
Bush
administration
had
picked
up
the
hand
of
cards
on
the
table
that
we
had
left
them
we
might
be
in
better
shape
nowLet's
review
the
Clinton
administration
negotiated
a
deal
with
North
Korea
don't
build
nuclear
weapons
and
we'll
provide
you
with
the
materials
to
build
nuclear
reactors
for
power
Those
were
the
cards
on
the
table
left
for
the
Bush
administration
a
naive
trust
in
the
goodwill
of
a
dictator
Of
course
with
today's
news
the
same
Clintonites
who
created
this
mess
will
march
in
front
of
television
cameras
and
blame
it
on
the
failed
diplomacy
of
the
Bush
administration
And
certain
members
of
the
media
coughOlbermanncough
will
pick
up
on
those
talking
points
and
run
with
them
as
truth
Once
again
it's
left
to
the
guys
and
gals
in
pajamas
to
remind
people
of
the
true
history
of
U.S
dealings
with
Pyongyang
The
Clinton
administration
will
try
their
best
to
kick
this
into
the
laps
of
the
current
administration
It's
become
clear
that
the
former
Clintonites
are
going

spend
their

trying

blame

The
Full
Quote
Remember
this
story
Well
here's
the
full
Eason
Jordan
quote
Brian
and
I
have
had
some
good
discussions
and
I
believe
that
there
are
people
at
the
Pentagon
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
but
candidly
and
we
hear
this
all
the
time
from
officials
in
Washington
actions
speak
louder
than
words
And
you
talk
about
dignity
and
respect
for
un-embedded
journalists
and
journalists
in
general
but
the
reality
is
that
at
least
8
maybe
10
maybe
more
journalists
in
Iraq
have
been
killed
by
the
US
military
There
are
reports
that
I
believe
to
be
true
that
journalists
have
been
arrested
and
tortured
by
US
forces
One
case
that
was
not
talked
about
here
an
Al-Jazeera
journalist
put
in
Abu
Ghraib
and
physically
and
emotionally
abused
called
a
Jazeera
boy
and
forced
to
eat
his
shoe
and
other
things
Even
now
there's
an
Al-Arabiya
journalist
in
Fallujah
who's
been
in
captivity
now
for
a
week
The
US
military
has
said
that
he
is
not
guilty
of
anything
and
he'll
be
freed
but
we're
now
6
or
7
days
into
his
captivity
It's
just
these
actions
and
the
fact
that
no-one
in
the
US
military
has
been
punished
or
reprimanded
for
any
of
these
things
would
indicate
that
the
US
military
really
does
not
have
respect
for
the
journalistic
corps
in
Iraq.I
love
the
last
sentence
How
many
of
these
accusations
can
be
substantiated
If
you
have
the
time
I
recommend
reading
the
entire
transcript
You'll
learn
a
lot
more
about
Nik
Gowing
the
BBC
journalist
whose
writing
is
recommended
by
Chris
Cramer
Here
is
a
sampling
of
one
of
his
questions
One
question
about
the
political
imperative
of
the
Defence
Secretary
and
those
serving
him
both
in
the
civilian
field
and
also
in
uniform
You're
upfront
speaking
to
us
today
but
there
is
a
very
strong
impression
that
has
been
confirmed
by
other
coalition
militaries
that
the
media
are
a
damn
nuisance
ignore
them
ignore
the
laws
of
armed
conflict
ignore
the
Geneva
Convention
ignore
the
International
Criminal
Court
and
any
fear
of
war
crimes.The
entire
discussion
shows
the
problem
the
paranoia
is
much
larger

The
Why
So
why
am
I
so
annoyed
by
what
Eason
Jordan
Chris
Cramer
and
Nik
Gowing
have
said
What's
the
big
deal
right
Everyone
is
entitled
to
their
own
opinion
right
Absolutely
but
words
have
consequences
and
where
you
put
voice
to
those
words
sometimes
speaks
louder
than
the
statement
you're
making
Especially
if
that
statement
is
not
true
Eason
Jordan
and
Chris
Cramer
have
made
some
astounding
accusations
against
members
of
the
United
States
military
and
when
called
to
account
for
those
statements
they
hide
Instead
of
producing
evidence
to
back
up
their
claims
these
journalists
do
what
they
would
never
allow
a
politician
in
the
same
situation
to
do
they
say
nothing
Journalism
has
long
benefitted
from
this
double
standard
Rarely
have
they
been
called
to
account
for
overblown
or
false
stories
or
the
outrageous
statements
they
sometimes
make
when
away
from
a
camera
As
a
profession
journalists
have
a
great
deal
of
power
and
responsibility
to
the
public
People
trust
them
For
decades
we
have
watched
as
they
have
abused
that
trust
at
times
and
used
their
clout
to
push
through
personal
agendas
When
I
was
in
college
a
statement
some
of
my
journalism
professors
used
to
make
was
that
journalism
was
one
of
the
only
jobs
in
America
with
constitutional
protection
It
was
given
that
protection
because
the
founders
felt
it
was
important
for
the
government
to
be
held
accountable
for
its
actions
But
who
holds
journalists
accountable
for
their
actions
and
statements
Until
recently
no
one
I
got
involved
in
this
story
for
a
few
reasons
One
my
father
was
in
the
military
and
I
grew
up
surrounded
by
people
who
served
in
the
armed
forces
Naturally
I'm
a
bit
protective
of
those
who
give
up
many
of
the
things
we
take
for
granted
to
protect
this
country
Another
reason
is
because
it's
just
a
good
story
The
adrenaline
shot
that
comes
with
finding
a
scoop
is
like
no
other
Finally
it's
because
while
everyone
has
the
right
to
their
own
opinion
they
don't
have
the
right
to
their
own
facts
It
looks
like
Jordan
Cramer
and
Gowing
have
been
creating
stories
of
military
horrors
to
suit
an
agenda
No
one
should
be
allowed
to
get
away
with
slandering
other
people
and
not
expect
to
be
called
to
account
for
it
CNN
should
demand
the
release
of
that
tape
and
should
do
a
bit
of
self-examination
of
their
foreign
correspondants
Bias
is
one
thing
having
executives
who
outright
lie
is
another

Who
is
Nik
Gowing
The
latest
character
in
the
Eason
Jordan/Chris
Cramer
oh
heck...let's
just
say
CNN
kerfuffle
is
BBC
journalist
Nik
Gowing
an
author
recommended
by
Chris
Cramer
who
wrote
a
piece
accusing
U.S
and
Israeli
troops
of
deliberately
targeting
journalists
This
piece
of
reporting
can
be
found
on
Aljazeera.com
and
is
doubtless
a
windfall
of
propaganda
for
those
in
the
Middle
East
who
look
for
reasons
to
hate
the
United
States
Gowing
has
helped
fuel
anti-American
feeling
in
the
Arab
media
by
suggesting
the
United
States
deliberately
targeted
Al-Jazeera's
news
broadcast
Suggestions
that
part
of
US
war
policy
was
to
deliberately
target
news
organisations
drew
attention
from
the
Newsworld
conference
of
media
executives
meeting
recently
in
Barcelona
Reflecting
the
broad
concerns
amongst
journalists
BBC
World
correspondent
Nik
Gowing
told
the
conference
It
seems
to
me
there
is
some
evidence
to
be
put
to
the
Pentagon
about
the
targeting
of
news
organisations
It
seems
people
uplinking
journalistic
material
by
satellite
can
be
targeted
legitimately
Gowing
noted
al-Jazeera
has
been
providing
some
material
that
has
been
very
uncomfortable
Gowing
also
compared
the
attack
on
al-Jazeera
to
the
US
bombing
of
Serbian
TV
in
Belgrade
in
1999.Gowing
made
similar
claims
in
the
Guardian
The
new
Pentagon
warnings
following
the
al-Jazeera
bombing
now
appear
to
make
such
deployments
even
riskier
The
Pentagon
is
warning
news
organisations
stay
out
or
assume
your
technology
will
make
you
one
of
our
targets.In
The
Prince
Nicolo
Machiavelli
says
And
the
first
opinion
which
one
forms
of
a
prince
and
of
his
understanding
is
by
observing
the
men
he
has
around
him
and
when
they
are
capable
and
faithful
he
may
always
be
considered
wise
because
he
has
known
how
to
recognize
the
capable
and
to
keep
them
faithful
But
when
they
are
otherwise
one
cannot
form
a
good
opinion
of
him
for
the
prime
error
which
he
made
was
in
choosing
them
Chris
Cramer
and
Eason
Jordan
do
themselves
and
their
reputation
no
favor
by
associating
with
men
like
Nik
Gowing
Jordan
and
Cramer
not
only
associate
with
Gowing
but
in
Cramer's
case
recommend
his
writings
which
gives
us
an
insight
into
what
these
CNN
men
really
think
about
the
military
and
its
treatment
of
journalists

last

The

are
an

into

that
face

In

they
provide

into
what
journalists
think
about
their
profession
and
the
countries
from
which
they
report
While
reading
a
Tribute
to

and
Media
Workers
Killed

I
came
across
a
strange
quote
from
Chris
Cramer
CNN
International's
managing
director
talking
about
a
chapter
from
the
book
Dying
to
Tell
the
Story
A
contribution
from
our
chairman
Nik
Gowing
about
our
colleagues
caught
in
the
crossfire
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
as
a
result
of
screw
ups
or
whatever
you
choose
to
ascribe
to
those
particular
activities.So
I
did
a
little
more
searching,and
came
across
an
open
index
page
on
the
International
News
Safety
Institute's
webpage
In
that
page
I
found
a
speech
by
Chris
Cramer
where
he
makes
a
similar
but
more
specific
quote
I
want
to
commend
to
you
the
very
sad
very
traumatic
and
very
important
book
which
INSI
has
backed
from
the
start
It's
a
first
of
its
kind
A
detailed
tribute
to
each
and
every
one
of
our
colleagues
who
died
or
went
missing
Important
contributions
from
the
freelance
community
From
the
security
industry
From
Nik
Gowing
on
the
worrying
trend
of
journalists
who
died
at
the
hands
of
the
coalition
in
the
crossfire
through
screw
ups
however
you
want
to
portray
it.In
these
quotes
he
seems
to
be
suggesting
quite
strongly
that
maybe
it
wasn't
just
screw
ups
that
led
to
the
deaths
of
journalists
at
the
hands
of
the
coalition
Perhaps
it's
time
to
start
putting
pressure
on
Cramer
to
explain
exactly
what
he
meant
by
these
little
asides
Or
maybe
it's
just
me
Comments
welcome
via
email
UPDATE
I
found
an
edited
version
of
Gowing's
contribution
to
the
book
that
was
praised
by
Cramer
Here
is
a
quote
There
is
a
growing
fear
that
some
governments
especially
the
most
militarily
sophisticated
like
the
United
States
and
Israel
are
sanctioning
the
active
targeting
of
journalists
in
war
zones
The
evidence
is
that
they
want
to
shut
down
what
we
are
there
to
do
to
bear
witness
and
report
The
concern
is
that
there
is
an
apparent
culture
of
impunity
This
is
already
encouraging
others
to
believe
they
can
get
away
with
targeting
and
eliminating
journalists
or
at
least
ignoring
the
issue
More
than
ever
we
are
inconvenient
eyes
and
ears
who
monitor
and
report
what
some
in
power
would
much
prefer
we
did
not
Media
activity
in
the
midst
of
real-time
fighting
is
now
regarded
by
commanders
as
having
military
significance
If
worst
case
fears
are
shown
to
be
justified
then
on
the
political
and
military
side
some
senior
officials
seem
to
view
our
24-hour/7
days-a-week
presence
as
a
real-time
military
threat
that
on
some
occasions
justifies
our
removal
by
the
application
of
deadly
force
Despite
expressions
of
sympathy
the
killing
or
injury
of
journalists
and
technicians
appears
to
be
of
barely
marginal
concern.This
is
pretty
strong
stuff
Does
Cramer
agree
with
it
or
was
he
recommending
the
book
and
this
chapter
in
particular
for
other
reasons

The
End
of
Triumphalism
Powerline's
Deacon
argues
that
the
Eason
Jordan
story
could
humble
the
triumphalism
of
the
blogosphere
that
began
with
Trent
Lott
and
most
recently
helped
bring
an
early
end
to
Dan
Rather's
career
He
raises
a
good
point
the
MSM
could
shut
the
story
down
completely
and
Eason
Jordan
may
keep
his
job
Such
a
consideration
forces
us
to
examine
the
definition
of
success
in
pursuing
this
story
One
measure
of
success
of
course
would
be
the
future
employment
of
Eason
Jordan
If
Jordan
loses

the

count
it

But
what
if

I
would
argue
what

far
is

success

is
more
than
simply
blog
triumphalism
What
Hugh

done
is
what
journalists
are
supposed
to
do
simply
tell
a

expose

to
sunlight
Countless
people
read
these

free

make
their
own
judgments
regarding

I

vote
with
their
feet
when
it
comes
to
the
Cable
News
Network
the
Washington
Post
and
the
rest
of
the
mainstream
media
Again
the
most
important
currency
any
news
organization
has
is
its
credibility
CNN
has
proven
it's
willing
to
stonewall
a
story
about
one
of
its
own
and
the
Washington
Post
has
shown
a
similar
willingness
to
take
part
in
what
amounts
to
a
coverup
Both
of
these
news
organizations
have
lost
credibility
in
the
eyes
of
countless
readers
as
a
result
of
this
story
and
that's
something
they
cannot
easily
regain
The
damage
has
already
been
done
The
question
now
is
will
those
news
organizations
recognize
and
rectify
it

On

When

I
read
quite
a
few
books
about

I
had
my

guesses
about
the
identity

the

that
helped
bring
down
a

Bob
Woodward
has
always
said
he
won't
reveal
Deep
Throat's
identity
until
the
source
dies
Well
he
was
recently
heard
telling
people
at
the
Post
that
DT
is
very
ill
Which
has
led
some
to
an
incredible
supposition
on
the
source's
identity
Chief
Justice
William
Rehnquist
who
both
served
in
the
Nixon
administration
and
is
quite
seriously
ill
D
Magazine
has
some
good
evidence
to
back
up
the
claim
Could
you
imagine
Now
that's
a
great
political
story
and
if
true
some
credit
has
to
be
given
to
Woodward
Bernstein

Finally

Hugh

a
C
I
think
Hugh
is
being
generous
Kurtz
leaves
out
some
important
context
namely
that
this
isn't
the
first
time
Jordan
has
leveled
such
accusations
against
American
soldiders
and
that
he
has
said
the
same
thing
about
Israeli
forces
Those
comments
show
that
Jordan
didn't
misspeak
He's
said
this
sort
of
thing
before
and
was
just
repeating
a
familiar
refrain
The
only
difference
is
this
time
he
was
called
on
it
And
the
media
is
protecting
him
The
New
York
Sun
has
a
better
story
about
Eason's
Fables
and
provides
the
much-needed
facts
about
Jordan's
previous
slanders
of
American

Israeli

Woodward

there

over
the

in

the

Now
reporters
from
that

are
helping
create

maintain
a
similar
wall
against
the

Self-preservation
has
taken
precedence
over
journalistic
integrity
Remember
Kurtz's
lazy
reporting
about
Jordan
when
he
writes
about
the
Watergate
scandal
in
a
few
weeks
or
months
This
story
helps
confirm
what
we

about

the

Sanctified
Songs
While
listening
to
the
local
Christian
station
I
heard
some
familiar
lyrics
Give
me
a
word
Give
me
a
sign
Show
me
where
to
look
Tell
what
will
I
find
will
I
find
Lay
me
on
the
ground
Fly
me
in
the
sky
Show
me
where
to
look
Tell
me
what
will
I
find
will
I
find
Oh
heaven
let
your
light
shine
downThe
song
was
Shine
by
Collective
Soul
but
the
soulful
voice
singing
them
was
Christian
artist
Charity
Von
Von's
version
is
quite
good
even
if
I
do
prefer
the
original
sentimental
reasons
In
MercyMe's
recent
concert
DVD
the
group
starts
out
with
In
the
Air
Tonight
and
ends
with
Where
the
Streets
Have
No
Name
Other
Christian
artists
such
as
Sixpence
None
the
Richer
Steven
Curtis
Chapman
and
Nicole
Nordeman
have
also
recently
recorded
cover
songs
Most
of
these
songs
have
been
well-done
and
in
the
case
of
Sixpence
and
their
version
of
Don't
Dream
it's
Over
better
than
the
original
The
fact
that
such
songs
are
being
recorded
and
played
on
Christian
radio
stations
brings
up
some
interesting
questions
the
primary
being
why
do
the
songs
suddenly
gain
a
measure
of
acceptance
simply
because
Christians
are
singing
them
Part
of
the
reason
I
suppose
is
we
know
or
can
at
least
surmise
that
the
songs
are
being
sung
to
God
rather
than
to
an
earthly
love
This
trend
shows
how
absurd
the
modern-day
church's
definitions
of
what
is
secular
and
what
is
Christian
can
truly
be
Is
the
determination
based
on
the
words
or
on
the
artists
singing
them
Are
secular
lyrics
sanctified
when
they
are
sung
with
the
vocal
chords
of
a
Christian
The
music
of
U2
is
a
good
example
Our
local
radio
station
plays
Sanctus
Real's
version
of
Beautiful
Day
It's
a
decent
tune
Is
there
any
reason
though
not
to
play
the
original
How
about
40
It's
a
worship
tune
written
in
U2's
early
days
A
version
by
dcTalk
was
played
on
Christian
stations
a
few
years
ago
but
I've
never
heard
the
original
The
first
couple
of
stanzas
I
waited
patiently
for
the
Lord
He
inclined
and
heard
my
cry
He
brought
me
up
out
of
the
pit
Out
of
the
miry
clay
I
will
sing
sing
a
new
song
I
will
sing
sing
a
new
songAgain
a
great
song
with
a
fabulous
bass
line
Michael
W
Smith
recently
re-recorded
it
for
a
concert
video
and
does
a
fine
job
with
it
One
group
that
seems
to
escape
the
Christian/secular
divide
is
Lifehouse
To
the
local
station's
credit
they
do
play
the
songs
of
this
band
on
their
station
I'm
not
suggesting
Christian
stations
play
the
songs
of
an
Eminem
or
Aerosmith
Nor
should
we
give
up
the
worship
music
that
explictly
offers
praise
to
God
As
a
church
though
it's
time
to
re-examine
our
narrow
definitions
of
what
makes
something
secular
and
what
makes
something
else
Christian
The
current
definition
simply
doesn't
work
I
do
not
believe
that
because
I'm
a
Christian
it
gives
my
vocal
chords
the
power
to
make
secular
songs
into
Christian
ones
It
may
seem
like
a
silly
argument
but
my
point
is
this
Christian
artists
sing
those
lyrics
because
most
of
those
songs
are
fantastic
pieces
of
writing
by
any
standard
To
paraphrase
C.S
Lewis
maybe
what
the
church
needs
is
fewer
Christians
artists
writing
mediocre
songs
and
more
artists
who
happen
to
be
Christian
writing
good
songs
Maybe
it's
time
to
start
considering
quality
rather
than
fealty
to
the
modern
secular/Christian
definition
After
all
the
Bible
just
says
make
a
joyful
noise
And
for
my
money
Where
the
Streets
Have
No
Name
fits
that
description
pretty
well

joke
about

calling
the
attention

The

a
pathetic

See

The
sight

In

I
see

as

step

for

Progress

only
come
with

parts

Like

Shales
never

around
to
explaining
exactly
why
pushing

envelope
is
such
a
good
thing
Is
nakedness

profanity
in

of
itself
a
social
good
What
is
the
ultimate
goal
Pornography
during
prime-time
The
broadcast
premiere
of
uncut

movies
What
does
Shales
want
and
why
does
it
matter
so
much
And
as
it
has
been
asked
on
so
many
issues
of
late
where
are
the
feminists
on
this
It
seems
that
more
often
than
not
pushing
the
envelope
on
television
means
not
only
more
cussin
but
an
increase
in
nudity
Specifically
female
nudity
Once
upon
a
time
feminists
were
against
the
portrayal
of
women
as
nothing
more
than
empty-headed
sex
objects
on
television
Their
silence
indicates
that
they're
okay
with
such
uses
of
women
so
long
as
it
annoys
conservatives
There's
something
kind
of
creepy
about
the
spectacle
of
a
middle-aged
man
tsk-tsking
that
this
year's
Super
Bowl
didn't
objectify
women
enough
during
the
broadcast
Shales
and
his
fellow
critics
can
use
all
the
rhetoric
they
want
to
justify
their
beliefs
that
we
need
to
have
more
enlightened
read
European
attitudes
about
sex
that
the
Janet
Jackson
and
Nicole
Sheridan
episodes
actually
showed
empowered
women
that
we
need
to
be
more
open-minded
about
such
things
In
the
end
though
it
all
comes
down

a

I
didn't
watch
Ted
Kennedy's

the
Press
this

The
Democrats
have
had
another
bad
week
President
Bush's
State
of

extremely
well-received
the

was

The

I
wish
someone
would
tell
the

a
large
headline
just
under

fold
trumpets
a
story
about

irregularities
Part
of
the
problem
the

have
is
who
they
allow
to
speak
for
them
Harry

Nancy
Pelosi
Barbara
Boxer
and
Ted

have
become
the
public
face
of
the

much
to
their
detriment
as
a

These
four
spent
much
of
their
political
career
in
Congress
when
it
was
in
Democratic
hands
The
experience
of
being
in
the
minority
seems
to
have
embittered
them
to
no
end
and
it
shows
in
their
recent
rhetoric
Howard
Dean's
first

as
chair
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee
should
be
to
pressure
the
Democrat
leadership
in

to

optimistic
Ditto
for

Colorado
Senator

Heck
even

himself

when
he's

seeing
once

the

Bill

Wow
Janeane
Garofalo
has
just
proven
me
wrong
You
see
I
figured
the
depravity
and
venom
of
the
angry
left
had
just
about
hit
rock
bottom
As
you
can
plainly
see
I
was
completely
off-base
Blogger
and
talk-show
host
Kevin
McCullough
was
watching
MSNBC
and
caught
Garofalo
comparing
members
of
Congress
holding
up
ink-stained
fingers
at
the
State
of
the
Union
to
Nazis
I'm
beginning
to
think
we
should
just
rename
Godwin's
Law
to
somehow
include
the
ad
hominem
attacks
that
always
make
up
Garofalo's
rhetoric
Garofalo
doesn't
care
that
the
members
of
Congress
holding
up
purple
fingers
were
in
fact
doing
so
to
show
solidarity
with
Iraqis
who
braved
suicide
bombers
mortars
and
bullets
to
cast
a
ballot
last
Sunday
Like
a
net
flamer
with
more
attitude
than
sense
Garofalo
saw
a
chance
to
use
the
tired
Nazi
analogy
again
and
went
with
it
Laziness
doesn't
even
begin
to
describe
her
schtick
She
does
actually
bring
up
the
vote
only
to
say
this
about
the
Republicans
with
purple
fingers
as
if
they
have
solidarity
with
the
Iraqis
who
braved
physical
threats
against
their
lives
to
vote
as
if
somehow
these
inked-fingered
Republicans
have
something
to
do
with
that
Well
Jeneane
if
it
were
up
to
you
and
your
ilk
those
Iraqis
never
would
have
had
the
chane
to
cast
a
ballot
for
anyone
but
Saddam
Hussein
Garofalo
opposed
the
liberation
of
Iraq
I
absolutely
would
not
say
that
this
war
in
Iraq
is
a
just
war
The
Anglo-American
war
in
Iraq
has
been
going
on
for
many
years.And
TONY

The

absolutely

I

Well
how
do

get
18
European
nations

up

GAROFALO
Well
yes
I
guess
it's
a
lot
of
coercion
and
arm-twisting
I
would
say...I
would
say
that
it
has
been
the
idea
since
1990
91
to
go
into
Iraq
and
to
have
hegemony
over
the
region
redraw
the

Oil
is
a
part
of
it
not
all
of
it
But
9/11
has
been
a
way
to
reinvigorate
the
plan
that
the
right-wingers
and
the
ideologues
and
people
like
the
people
at
the
American
Enterprise
Institute
and...Snow
stopped
her
here
so
we'll
never
know
what
conspiracy
theory
she
was
about
to
unleash
She
doesn't
want
to
face
the
fact
that
she
was
wrong
about
Hussein
and
wrong
about
the
war
Like
far
too
many
in
today's
left
she's
got
her
mind
made
up
so
don't
confuse
her
with
the
facts
The
left
just
cannot
seem
to
admit
that
by
voting
in
large
numbers
last
Sunday
Iraqis
just
pulled
the

out

There's
a
Crisis
But
Do
Nothing
Survey
finds
75
percent
of
Maine
residents
think
there's
a
problem
with
Social
Security
but
only
24
percent
favor
the
President's
plan
The
president
isn't
widely
popular
in
this
state
which
went
for
Gore
in
2000
and
Kerry
in
2004
Of
course
if
this
paragraph
is
any
indication
the
survey's
methodology
was
flawed
More
than
two-thirds
of
Mainers
believed
it
was
most
important
the
program
yield
guaranteed
monthly
benefits
according
to
the
poll
released
the
day
after
Bush's
State
of
the
Union
address
during
which
he
outlined
his
plan
to
revamp
the
system
Twenty-five
percent
thought
it
was
more
important
to
allow
private
investments.So
the
question
asked
seemed
to
assume
private
investments
would
come
at
the
expense
of
guaranteed
monthly
benefits
Well
no
wonder
the
support
was
so
low
They
might
as
well
have
asked
Do
you
want
to
get
your
money
every
month
or
have
the
president
give
it
to
mustache-twirling
cigar-smoking
Wall
Street
plutocrats
I'm
glad
the
president
is
taking
this
fight
right
to
the
people
with
his
campaign-style
swing
It's
obvious
from
this
survey
that
the
media
and
the
Democrats
aren't
going
to
fight
this
one
on
the
facts
but
by
scaring
people
into
thinking

Stonewalling
Eason
Jordan
has
yet
to
either
deny
or
explain
the
comments
he
made
at
Davos
accusing
the
American
military
of
deliberately
targeting
journalists
The
Washington
Times
editorial
on
the
subject
today
mentions
all
of
the
stories
Jordan
has
told
regarding
the
military
and
journalists
and
finds
them
lacking
in
specifics
CNN
is
now
on
the
spot
Will
they
ask
Jordan
to
either
prove
his
slanders
or
resign
Or
will
they
take
the
CBS
route
stonewall
until
they
think
the
storm
will
blow
over
We
already
know
based
on
a
speech
Jordan
made
to
students
at
Harvard
University
that
Jordan
thinks
globally
before
he
thinks
of
the
United
States
I
don't
care
and
CNN
doesn't
care

We're

still

being
creative
in
circumventing
them
in
the

if
we
need
to
do
that
to
report
accurately
and
fairly

impartially
and
independently
to
our

around

We

We're
grateful
for
all

Unfortunately
those

not
extend
beyond

at

and
that's
where
we
run

accused

Unlike

I
still
haven't
gotten
my
spin
email
from
the
CNN
public
affairs
department
Meanwhile
the
major
media
is
ignoring
the
story
Hugh
Hewitt
is
blaming
bias
for
the
silence
and
that
does
have
a
part
to
play
but
I
think
it's
something
deeper
Eason
Jordan
has
for
years
been
making
up
stories
about
murder
and
torture
of
journalists
No
evidence
is
ever
given
to
corroborate
his
stories
he
just
throws
out
accusations
and
gets
applause
from
media
elites
What
Jordan
has
been
doing
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
what
John
Kerry
has
done
during
his
political
career
If
Kerry's
tales
are
to
be
believed
he
fought
in
Cambodia
at
Christmas
ran
guns
to
the
Khmer
Rouge
and
took
CIA
operatives
and
SEALS
into
enemy
territory
His
four-month
tour
in
Vietnam
was
turned
into
a
Clancy
novel
of
intrigue
and
action
At
the
time
I
remember
feeling
annoyed
at
the
media
for
refusing
to
examine
Kerry
but
at
the
same
time
felt
rather
sorry
for
the
Senator
There
is
a
problem
with
those
who
exaggerate
their
own
exploits
It
usually
means
they
don't
feel
as
though
they
accomplished
enough
Eason
Jordan
is
a
journalist
That
happened
to
be
my
major
in
college
and
I
was
surrounded
by
potential
journalists
When
we
talked
about
our
futures
we
didn't
describe
it
as
going
out
and
telling
stories
Journalism
was
a
noble
calling
a
mission
In
college
I
met
and
covered
Congressmen
Senators
a
Russian
prime
minister
and
the
vice
president
of
the
United
States
It's
heady
stuff
but
no
matter
how
many
of
these
events
one
covers
there's
always
this
sense
of
being
a
watcher
not
a
player
Some
journalists
desperately
want
to
be
players
I
was
one
of
them
which
is
part
of
the
reason
I
got
out
of
it
and
went
back
to
graduate
school
Others
though
stay
in
journalism
and
try
to
create
change
through
their
reporting
Eason
Jordan
I
think
is
one
of
those
people
Unfortunately
though
he's
not
content
with
passivity
he
wants
to
be
part
of
the
action
People
who
are
part
of
the
action
are
important
and
worthy
of
coverage
by
his
peers
So
he
exaggerates
a
problem
that
does
exist
journalists
die
doing
their
jobs
Jordan
isn't
content
with
even
this
passivity
it
seems
so
he
takes
the
problem
a
step
further
He
creates
the
myth
that
his
reporters
are
so
good
at
their
jobs
that
they've
become
a
threat
and
are
targeted
by
those
with
power
In
a
sense
he's
trying
to
create
martyrs
Over
the
years
he's
changed
his
tales
to
include
the
militaries
of
other
countries
and
expanded
the
abuse
inflicted
upon
journalists
from
targeted
assasination
to
torture
Jordan
has
created
a
fantasy
world
worthy
of
Walter
Mitty
in
his
need
to
feel
important
The
irony
of
course
is
that
he
is
important
he's
a
major
and
respected
by
some
news
executive
at
a
huge
news
organization
The
fantasy
life
that
he
created
to
feel
important
will
ultimately
end
up
hurting
the
job
that
actually
gave
him
what
he
sought
Do
I
feel
sorry
for
Eason
Jordan
A
little
bit
But
that
doesn't
change
the
facts
he
deliberately
slandered
the
militaries
of
the
United
States
and
Israel
He
has
brought
discredit
upon
his
employers
and
he
should
be
removed
from
his
job

just
tried
to
pass
off
a
freaking
GI
JOE
DOLL
as
a
captured
American
soldier
That
isn't
exactly
a
sign
of
strength
You
probably
should
have
rewritten
your
speech
after
the
Iraq
vote
10:24
This
is
a
downer

Nice
try
but
it
won't
work

you

the
whole

thing
10:27
After
all
the
talk
about
supporting
the
troops
it
has
to
be
pointed
out
that
Pelosi
voted
against
the
87
billion
for
the
troops
Reid
voted
for
it
It's
a
pretty
easy
fact
to
look
up
so
why
were
the
Democrats
dumb
enough
to
let
Pelosi
make
those
statements
All
in
all
nice
effort
but
pessimism
and
dour
talk
should
never
be
the
answer
to
optimism
and
hope
You'd
think

The

just

liveblogging
it

so

wears

it's
a

he's
able
to
pass
that
Even

one
so
it

I
really
wish

9:24

55

Good

Now
speaking
to
younger
workers...sounding
okay
so
far
He's
giving
the
facts
on
the
issue
excellent
approach
Showing
the
problem
in
stark
tones
Social
Security
will
be
paying
out
more
than
it
takes
in
This
is
exactly
what
we
need
on
this
issue
facts
in
the
debate
rather
than
the
hysterics
of
AARP
and
Harry
Reid
9:25
Democrats
are
starting
to
groan
Literally
I
think
the
president
should
stop
his
speech
and
offer
them
a
nice
tall
glass
of
shut
the
heck
up
9:26

So

Some

Jordan's
Libel
This
is
a
troubling
story
The
chief
news
executive
of
a
major
network
has
accused
U.S
soldiers
of
targeting
journalists
in
Iraq
His
remarks
were
made
at
the
Davos
World
Economic
Forum
so
they
have
gone
largely
unreported
in
the
major
media
of
this
country
Hugh
Hewitt
is
asking
why
This
is
the
same
Eason
Jordan
who
admitted
in
the
pages
of
the
New
York
Times
that
CNN
didn't
report
stories
about
Saddam's
atrocities
It
was
a
stunning
admission
CNN
had
abdicated
its
responsibility
as
a
teller
of
truth
to
guarantee
access
to
a
murderous
regime
Despite
overwhelming
evidence
that
people
were
being
tortured
raped
and
murdered
by
agents
of
Hussein
and
his
sons
CNN
kept
silent
for
fear
of
offending
a
madman
and
losing
their
ability
to
report
from
Iraq
Now
Jordan
is
making
terrible
accusations
against
American
troops
with
no
evidence
to
back
up
his
claims
What
does
it
say
about
this
man
that
he
is
willing
to
lie
by
omission
about
actual
atrocities
while
making
up
others
Can
we
attach
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
he
lies
about
his
own
country
while
protecting
a
regime
like
Hussein's
On
the
surface
it
looks
like
he
thinks
the
administration
of
George
W
Bush
is
more
dangerous
than
the
regime
of
Saddam
Hussein's
Under
his
administration
CNN
gave
the
story
of
Abu
Gharib
more
airtime
than
the
torture
and
murder
that
took
place
under
Saddam
A
1999
talk
by
Jordan
to
students
at
Harvard
shows
just
how
much
Jordan
lied
about
CNN's
reporting
in
Iraq
CNN
has
had
tremendous
difficulties
with
the
Iraqi
government
a
government
that's
accused
me
during
my
own
trips
to
Baghdad
of
being
a
CIA
station
chief
for
Iraq
I
feel
lucky
to
have
emerged
alive
from
that
But
it's
very
difficult
working
from
Baghdad
It
was
during
the
war
and
it
continues
to
be
today
Our
view
is
first
of
all
we
will
not
consciously
pull
punches
If
I
ever
find
anybody
doing
it
then
those
people
will
be
history
at
this
network
as
well
as
with
our
Iraq
coverage.This
of
course
begs
the
question
of
why
Jordan
didn't
offer
his
own
resignation
since
he
was
the
one
who
pulled
the
punches
In
that
same
speech
he
offers
a
glimpse
of
his
worldview
and
his
view
of
why
CNN
exists
We
are
a
global
network
and
we
take
global
interest
first
not
U.S
interests
first.The
lecture
also
reminds
readers
of
the
fact
that
this
isn't
the
first
time
Eason
Jordan
has
been
involved
with
a
false
slander
of
U.S
troops
CNN's
biggest
mistake
came
just
a
year
ago
with
a
story
about
a
clandestine
U.S
military
effort
called
Operation
Tailwind...CNN's
Operation
Tailwind
reporting
fell
short
way
short
It
most
certainly
failed
the
fairness
test.I
would
submit
that
Jordan
has
himself
failed
the
fairness
test
and
it's
time
for
him
either
offer
more
evidence
for
his
outrageous
claims
or
retract
them
completely

UPDATE

11:34
a.m
Here's
another
case
of
Jordan
accusing
troops
Israeli
in
this
case
of
targeting
journalists
The
question
he
was
asked
and
his
answer
NG
Eason
why
do
you
think
you've
been
targeted
specifically
I
mean
there
are
Israeli
bumper
stickers
that
say
CNN
lies
the
Israeli
communications
minister
talked
about
CNN
as
being
evil
biased
and
unbalanced
you'll
be
familiar
with
all
these
quotes
EJ
Absolutely
well
the
Israeli
government
is
making
a
mistake
if
it
considers
CNN
the
enemy
CNN
is
just
trying
to
tell
the
story
of
Israel
the
story
of
Palestinian
areas
in
a
straightforward
way
We're
not
trying
to
favour
one
side
over
the
other
we're
not
going
to
pull
any
punches
in
our
reporting
but
the
truth
hurts
sometimes
and
it
hurts
both
sides
but
it's
a
mistake
to
target
the
news
media
We've
had
enormous
frustrations
in
having
access
to
occupied
areas
of
the
West
Bank
and
Israeli
forces
on
a
number
of
occasions
have
shot
at
CNN
personnel
and
in
fact
did
shoot
one
CNN
correspondent
he
was
badly
wounded
The
Israelis
say
they're
actually
trying
to
restrict
our
access
to
these
areas
and
they
say
it's
too
dangerous
for
you
to
be
there
and
my
response
to
that
is
that
it
wouldn't
be
nearly
as
dangerous
if
you
didn't
shoot
at
us
when
we're
clearly
labelled
as
CNN
crews
and
journalists
And
so
this
must
stop
this
targeting
of
the
news
media
both
literally
and
figuratively
must
come
to
an
end
immediately
That
was
five
minutes
with
Google
I'm
sure
more
will
be
found
UPDATE
IV
11:51
a.m
Yes
it
is
a
boring
day
at
work
Anyway
found
another
one
We're
working
two
very
very
big
stories
right
now
that
have
a
couple
of
things
in
common
One
is
they're
enormously
costly
but
more
importantly
or
more
worrying
is
that
they're
both
exceptionally
dangerous
because
we've
seen
something
in
both
places
that
I
thank
God
happens
very
rarely
and
that
is
that
in
both
places
journalists
are
not
only
being
killed
but
they're
being
targeted
There
are
combatants
in
both
of
these
conflicts
who
are
trying
to
kill
journalists
and
that
is
unusual
and
a
very
nightmarish
situation.Note
he
doesn't
identify
the
combatants
who
are
targeting
journalists
A
sign
of
libels
to
come
perhaps

Another

Eason
Jordan
chief

executive
at
CNN
said
there
had
been
only
a
limited
amount
of
progress
despite
repeated
meetings
between
news
organisations
and
the
US
authorities
Actions
speak
louder
than
words
The
reality
is
that
at
least
10
journalists
have
been
killed
by
the
US
military
and
according
to
reports
I
believe
to
be
true
journalists
have
been
arrested
and
tortured
by
US
forces
Mr
Jordan
told
an
audience
of
news
executives
at
the
News
Xchange
conference
in
Portugal.He
offers
one
example
of
torture
but
doesn't
talk
about
those
who
were
allegedly
killed
by
the
military

guy
has

Laughing
at
Terror
Much
fun
was
had
at
the
expense
of
terrorists
in
Iraq
yesterday
who
tried
to
pass
off
a
G.I
Joe
toy
as
a
captured
American
soldier
I
don't
know
whether
it
was
the
terrorists
themselves
who
did
this
or
if
it
was
one
of
the
photo
manipulation
specialists
from
Fark
or
Something
Awful
The
media
jumped
on
it
right
away
and
have
gotten
a
lot
of
criticism
for
it
some
of
it
unfair
Some
news
organizations
like
the
Guardian
deserve
scorn
becuase
they
are
still
running
with
the
now-discredited
story
Others
though
ran
with
it
at
first
and
then
backed
off
when
it
started
to
become
apparent
the
story
was
a
hoax
The
news
judgment
was
sound
a
captured
American
soldier
would
be
a
significant
story
and
it
was
reported
with
some
degree
of
caution
The
problem
arose
when
no
one
in
the
Associated
Press
or
Reuters
bothered
to
examine
the
facts
further
after
the
initial
filing
A
close
look
at
the
picture
makes
it
clear
the
soldier
in
question
has
odd
proportions
and
is
clothed
unlike
any
other
soldier
in
the
combat
zone
As
with
Rathergate
it
took
the
major
media
with
all
of
their
editors
and
fact-checkers
longer
to
discover
the
truth
than
those
sitting
at
their
computers
at
home
Even
after
getting
a
huge
black
eye
with
the
CBS
fraudulent
documents
story
the
media
has
not
learned
to
at
least
scour
the
major
blogs
regarding
a
large
story
It's
not
that
bloggers
are
smarter
than
reporters
it's
just
that
there
are
so
many
more
of
them
and
they
do
it
for
fun
I'm
not
suggesting
news
organizations
create
a
blogger
beat
but
think
someone
should
take
the
time
to
at
least
see
what
the
millions
of
open-source
journalists
are
saying
about
major
stories
So
what
does
this
story
say
about
the
terrorists
Well
if
it
was
al
Qaeda
or
a
similar
group
who
tried
to
pass
off
this
forgery
as
real
they
are
having
a
worse
week
than
anyone
thought
possible
Powerline
has
a
good
analysis
of
what
it
all
means
basically
that
democracy
in
Iraq
was
a
major
blow
and
this
was
a
vain
attempt
to
put
a

SOTU
I
have
music
practice
tonight
but
hope
to
be
home
in
time
to
live-blog
the
State
of
the
Union
speech
I'm
not
normally
a
big
fan
of
these
speeches
regardless
of
who
delivers
them
With
this
speech
I'm
more
interested
in
the
reactions
than
the
speech
itself
Will
the
Democrats
sit
on
their
hands
during
the
inevitable
standing
ovation
for
Iraq
Will
social
conservatives
go
nuts
after
the
president
fails
to
mention
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
And
who
will
be
the
mystery
guest
in
the
balcony
Soon
the
Democrats
have
to
make
a
decision
whether
they're
going
to
be
an
obstructionist
party
or
an
opposition
party
Obstructionism
cost
them
their
most
effective
leader
in
decades
this
last
election
season
Harry
Reid
and
Nancy
Pelosi
should
really
rethink
their
strategy
and
reign
in
their
extremists
Most
of
all
though
stop
letting
Kennedy
and
Kerry
get
in
front
of
cameras
UPDATE

today

are

during

Chairman
Dean
State
Democratic
leaders
have
backed
Howard
Dean
for
DNC
chair
giving
the
former
governor
a
boost
in
his
bid
to
replace
Terry
McAuliffe
Robert
Novak
is
reporting
though
that
Democrat
fundraisers
are
unhappy
with
the
thought
of
Dean
as
chair
Personally
I
think
Dean
would
make
a
great
chair
Yes
I'm
serious
The
man
is
articulate
passionate
and
obviously
knows
how
to
attract
media
attention
The
big
rap
against
him
is
that
his
passion
didn't
lead
to
any
votes
but
I
think
that's
more
a
result
of
his
political
naivete
than
what
he
said
during
the
campaign
John
Kerry
simply
had
a
much
more
well-organized
ground
game
in
Iowa
I
was
just
as
amused
as
everyone
else
by
the
scream
but
think
overall
Dean
got
a
bad
rap
for
that
moment
of...uh...exuberance
Of
course
I
joined
the
fray
at
the
time
by
mixing
Dean's
speech
with
Metallica's
Enter
Sandman
I
would
upload
the
results
of
that
here
but
Metallica
has
a
history
of
suing
fans
After
the
terrible
reign
of
McAuliffe
Democrats
need
a
guy
who
excites
the
base
I
honestly
think
Dean
is
too
smart
a
politician
to
depend
on
the
Bush-hating
left
for
his
support
He's
savvy
enough
I
think
to
realize
that
Bush-hating
has
pretty
much
run
its
course
and
it's
time
for
the
Democrats
to
start
coming
up
with
policy
solutions
to
counter
the
president's
agenda
rather
than
simply
counting
on
vitriol
and
obstructionism
to
further
their
cause
I
want
to
see
the
Democrats
jettison
the
fringe
left
and
become
a
serious
political
party
again
I
think
Dean
despite
his
past
forays
into
the
fever
swamps
is
the
man
to
do
that
After
all
only
Nixon
could
go
to
China
So
I
think
he
should
be
elected
chair
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee
because
the
U.S
needs
a
strong
two-party
system

Oops

doesn't
bode
well

Lileks
vs
Moyers
It's
no
contest
There's
even
an
obligitory
Gnat
moment
At
issue
is
the
environment
While
in
college
I
once
attended
an
Earth
First
rally
for
fun
Call
it
research
whatever
It
was
basically
a
church
service
Seriously
There
were
songbooks
in
the
back
of
the
room
full
of
odes
to
the
environment
You
think
I'm
kidding
Some
of
them
were
I
suppose
original
compositions
Others
were
rewritten
hymns
or
popular
songs
At
the
meeting
there
was
a
time
to
share
a
few
sermons
and
some
discussion
It
was
all
a
bit
boring
actually
No
talk
of
spiking
trees
or
burning
down
houses
For
that
one
had
to
take
a
philosophy
course
In
that
class
I
had
the
distinct
pleasure
of
reading
books
like
Ecotopia
and
Reweaving
the
World
The
Emergence
of
Ecofeminism
Class
discussion
was
interesting
There
were
about
three
or
four
conservatives
seven
or
eight
die-hard
environmentalists
and
a
bunch
of
apathetics
who
mostly
sat
around
looking
nervous
I
found
myself
arguing
with
people
who
honestly
believed
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
potentially
killing
someone
with
a
spiked
tree
since
the
tree
had
as
much
right
to
existence
as
the
logger
Our
professor
once
spent
ten
minutes
trying
to
explain
the
ecological
roots
of
the
f-word
And
people
wonder
why
college
made
me
more
conservative
I
have
a
pretty
good
imagination
but
I
couldn't
make
this
stuff
up
if
I
tried
The
class
did
have
its
hilarious
moments
though
Once
while
discussing
vegetarianism
there
was
a
heated
discussion
between
a
vegan
and
a
vegetarian
The
vegan
was
basically
accusing
the
vegetarian
of
heresy
for
having
the
audacity
to
wear
leather
and
drink
milk
The
debate
had
the
same
tone
and
tenor
of
fights
between
believers
in
predestination
and
those
who
believe
in
free
will
What
Lileks
brings
up
and
Moyers
constantly
ignores
is
that
the
left
has
just
as
many
extremists
as
the
right
and
they
can
be
just
as
dangerous
That
Moyers
has
ignored
the
extreme
left
while
railing
against
the
right-wing
shows
that
he
is
either
prejudiced
against
those
of
conservative
religious
belief
or
intellecually
lazy
Neither
reflects
well
on
him
or
his
former
employer

Profoundly
Dumb
The
Bangor
Daily
News
editorial
staff
should
find
its
own
style
and
stop
trying
to
copy
the
New
York
Times
Today's
editorial
on
Bush's
inspiration
for
the
inaugural
address
shows
learned
and
reasoned
rhetoric
can
have
just
as
stupid
a
message
as
an
angry
rant
Mr
Sharansky
has
been
a
hero
to
neoconservatives
ever
since
President
Reagan
obtained
his
release
from
a
Soviet
prison
camp
As
a
member
of
the
Israeli
parliament
the
Knesset
he
opposes
any
concessions
to
the
Palestinians
until
they
accept
democracy
Thus
he
opposed
the
Oslo
accord
broke
with
Prime
Minister
Ehud
Barak
in
2000
over
Mr
Barak's
plan
to
attend
a
peace
conference
in
Washington
and
has
opposed
Mr
Sharon's
plan
to
withdraw
from
Gaza.Sharansky
has
known
first-hand
the
terrors
of
totalitarian
government
and
is
now
advocating
for
democracy
The
nerve
of
some
people
It
seems
to
me
any
politician
unwilling
to
deal
with
the
late
Yasser
Arafat
and
demanding
freedom
for
people
who
have
not
previously
known
it
is
standing
on
solid
ground
In
the
book
Mr
Sharansky
foresees
peace
in
the
Middle
East
through
the
democratization
of
Palestine
and
Iraq
even
though
he
admits
this
process
may
take
many
years
or
even
decades
Like
Mr
Bush
he
calls
for
moral
clarity
in
fighting
evil
and
says
the
world
is
divided
between
those
who
are
prepared
to
confront
evil
and
those
who
are
willing
to
appease
it
He
goes
on
I
am
convinced
that
all
peoples
desire
to
be
free
I
am
convinced
that
freedom
anywhere
will
make
the
world
safer
everywhere
and
I
am
convinced
that
democratic
nations
led
by
the
United
States
have
a
critical
role
to
play
in
expanding
freedom
around
the
globe."Sounds
reasonable
Now
comes
what
Lileks
calls
the
damnable
but
A
review
of
the
book
in
The
Washington
Post
points
to
two
basic
flaws
in
Mr
Sharansky's
reasoning
The
first
is
his
belief
that
free
societies
are
always
peaceful
As
he
puts
it
Since
all
democratic
societies
strive
for
peace
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
belligerent
democracy
But
what
about
Iraq
at
least
partly
democratic
in
1948
joining
with
other
Arab
states
in
a
military
effort
to
overthrow
the
new
state
of
Israel
What
about
the
preventive
wars
fought
by
Israel
since
then
In
fact
what
about
the
U.S
pre-emptive
war
against
Iraq?This
criticism
is
partially
warranted
but
the
point
is
badly
made
They
just
couldn't
help
themselves
and
had
to
throw
in
the
moonbat
rhetoric
about
a
pre-emptive
war
against
Iraq
No
democracy
alone
will
not
guarantee
peaceful
relations
with
one's
neighbors
However
democracy
makes
it
much
harder
for
countries
to
simply
attack
other
countries
It
was
not
the
decision
of
one
man
that
led
us
into
Iraq
The
issue
was
brought
before
the
Congress
and
approved
by
elected
representatives
including
the
man
the
BDN
endorsed
in
the
presidential
election
As
clumsy
as
that
reasoning
is
it
pales
in
comparison
to
the
next
sentence
The
second
flaw
is
Mr
Sharansky's
failure
to
see
that
military
occupation
breeds
resentment
and
insurgency
Both
he
and
President
Bush
stumble
against
that
obstacle
as
they
present
visions
of
democracy
and
peace
between
Israel
and
the
Palestinians
and
in
Iraq
In
both
cases
peace
is
a
long
way
off
if
it
can
be
achieved
at
all.There
is
no
doubt
some
in
Iraq
are
a
little
peeved
at
the
presence
of
the
US
military
However
that
is
not
the
only
reason
for
resentment
and
insurgency
as
Zarqawi
helpfully
pointed
out
in
his
pre-election
missive
It
seems
President
Bush
was
right
just
after
September
11
Some
people
do
actually
hate
the
idea
of
freedom
and
are
willing
to
kill
to
prevent
it
Here's
what
Zarqawi
said
We
have
declared
a
fierce
war
on
this
evil
principle
of
democracy
and
those
who
follow
this
wrong
ideology...anyone
who
tries
to
help
set
up
this
system
is
part
of
it..."Many
of
those
who
are
now
setting
off
car
bombs
and
beheading
innocents
were
powerful
people
in
the
regime
of
Saddam
Hussein
So
yes
they
are
going
to
be
angry
at
the
occupation
Their
feelings
should
not
be
excused
or
legitimized
by
those
in
the
United
States
with
this
logic
In
Israel
the
government
is
tired
of
having
its
citizens
murdered
so
it
has
put
up
a
wall
and
cracked
down
on
violence
For
this
they
are
constantly
accused
of
breeding
terrorism
when
in
fact
they
are
preventing
it
If
Israel
stopped
these
actions
they
would
still
be
hated
that's
something
this
editorial
doesn't
mention
and
it's
an
important
facet
of
the
discussion
Terrorism
isn't
the
fault
of
those
terrorized
In
some
cases
it's
an
ideology
preached
in
schoolbooks
This
editorial
is
a
weak
attempt
to
portray
Israel
and
the
Bush
administration
as
obstacles
to
peace

who's
spent

Is
there
a
more
execrable

of

American
statesman
alive

than
Ted
Kennedy
Yes
yes

he's
a

a

wrapped
around
a

cynicism

he
matters
precisely
because
his

him
with

now
wholly

yesterday
They

opportunity

America

terrible
mistakes

though

In

my

very

I've
decided
that
on
this

I'm
not
going
to
watch
any

coverage
on

CNN

MSNBC
were
pushing
the
US
Embassy

pretty
hard
today
Our

the

had
a
headline
that
was
simply
obscene
in
size
top
of
the
fold
to
boot
to
trumpet
the
deaths
in
a
helicopter
crash
The
media
wants
the
Iraq
war
to
fail
because
such
an
event
would
make
Bush
look
bad
Never
mind
the
millions
of
people
who
would
be
affected
by
a
country
being
taken
over
by
terrorists
Never
mind
the
chaos
and
violence
that
would
follow
a
US
troop
withdrawl
Let
those
Iraqis
suffer
for
the
greater
good
of
scoring
political
points
The
sickness
that
has
infected
the

is
surprising
in
its
vehemence

sickening

Suicide
by

Senator

Why
on

Harry

this
The
U.S
military
presence
has
become
part
of

not
part
of
the
solution...We
need
a
new
plan
that
sets
fair

for
self-government
in

and
works
with
the
Iraqi
government
on

for
the

homecoming
of

military
is
part
of
the
problem
Do
these

supporting
the
troops
The
Democrats
are
hoping
that

will
be

them
what

If

denigrating
the

showing
pessimism
about
the
ability
of

they
will
fail

in

gain

Not
only
that
but
taking
American
troops
out
of
Iraq
would
leave
the
country
at
the

Is
Ted
Kennedy
so
craven
that
he's
willing
to
see
a
country
fall
in

to
have
a
chance
to
criticize

Oliver

an

whining

bad
Republicans
are
bringing
up
Senator
Robert
Byrd's...er...unfortunate
past
as
a
Grand
Kleagle

Ku
Klux

He's
flailing
about
trying
to
convince
all
of

that
it's
all
a
RIGHT
WING
PLOT
because
everyone's
come
to
the
same
conclusion
and
the
talking
points
just
seem
too
conveeenient
He
accuses
those
who
bring
it
up
of
being
on
the
take
By
the
way
Oliver
Willis
is
an
employee
of
an
organization
funded
by
megarich
white
guy
George
Soros
You
know
the
guy
who
wasted
heh
millions
to
defeat

Anyway
Willis
is
angry
that
some
of
his
heroes
have
feet
of
clay
and
is
taking
the
side
of
a
former
Klansman
over
an
African-American
woman
simply
because
the
woman
in
question
happens
to
be
a
Republican
He
can't
seem
to
face
the
fact
that
Byrd
has
a
racist
past
Sure
Byrd
repudiated
his
beliefs
but
that
didn't
stop
him
from
opposing
the
nominations
of

A
Petty
Rant
When
I
read
it
on
Andrew
Sullivan's
site
I
asked
myself
whether
it
was
worth
the
trouble
of
commenting
It
was
a
silly
little
comment
a
trifle
compared
to
the
whoppers
Sullivan
has
been
throwing
out
lately
But
now
I've
got
blogger's
block
and
I
can't
figure
out
what
to
rant
about
So
Sullivan
it
is
OSCAR
SANITY
Kudos
to
the
academy
for
ignoring
the
execrable
Fahrenheit
9/11
and
the
pornographic
Passion
Right-wing
and
left-wing
ideologues
will
be
disappointed
But
what
do
they
know
about
art?Like
I
said
a
silly
comment
but
so
telling
of
what
is
wrong
with
Sullivan
of
late
notice
he
doesn't
include
himself
in
either
of
the
extremes
No
he's
an
enlightened
one
above
all
of
the
partisanship
that
has
infested
our
culture
Sullivan
thought
the
passion
was
pornographic
because
of
the
violence
contained
in
it
He
conveniently
ignores
the
fact
that
this
violence
actually
happened
and
that
The
Passion
is
the
first
movie
to
truly
display
the
torment
that
Jesus
endured
to
die
for
our
sins
The
timing
of
Sullivan's
disdain
for
a
religious
movie
came
at
about
the
same
time
religous
conservatives
started
to
lobby
for
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
The
problem
with
Sullivan
is
that
he
refuses
to
acknowledge
his
true
reason
for
turning
on
the
Bush
administration
It
isn't
about
torture
or
overspending
it's
completely
about
gay
marriage
Other
bloggers
have
pointed
this
out
ad
nauseum
but
it's
a
conceit
of
Sullivan's
to
pretend
there
are
loftier
reasons
for
his
breaking
with
the
Bush
administration
and
his
endorsement
of
John
Kerry
Given
Sullivan's
sexual
orientation
I
can
understand
why
the
issue
is
so
important
to
him
But
disdain
for
a
particular
policy
issue
is
no
excuse
for
his
snarkiness
I
liked
The
Passion
I
thought
despite
the
violence
that
it
was
a
beautifully-shot
movie
The
Academy
contrary
to
what
Sullivan
states
seemed
to
agree
as
they
nominated
it
for
a
cinematography
award
Sullivan's
east
coast
snob
is
showing
and
it
isn't
pretty
I'm
not
sure
why
I
keep
checking
his
site
habit
nostalgia
whatever
I
really
should
stop

Hugh
Hewitt
has
posted
the
entire
article
by
Jonathan
Rauch
on
his
website
along
with
a
letter
from
Mr
Rauch
In
his
letter
the
author
admits
that
his
sentence
regarding
abortion
clinics
and
conservatives
was
careless
and
offered
an
explanation
for
it
that
makes
sense
So
is
the
article
a
slur
on
religious
conservatives
as
the
excerpt
posted
yesterday
suggests
To
be
honest
not
really
and
I
apologize
to
Mr
Rauch
for
my
earlier
characterization
of
it
and
to
the
Atlantic
the
magazine
in
which
it
is
printed
A
good
deal
of
the
article
is
statistics
and
studies
showing
that
although
America's
politics
may
be
split
down
the
middle
there
is
amazing
conformity
of
opinion
on
many
issues
including
gun
control
the
death
penalty
and
the
importance
of
religion
in
everyday
life
Rauch
gives
a
good
overview
of
why
politics
seems
to
have
grown
less
pragmatic
and
more
ideological
the
death
of
the
strong
party
system
in
the
United
States
put
the
power
to
select
candidates
in
the
hands
of
the
voters
and
the
candidates
themselves
Rauch's
thesis
is
that
American
politics
has
grown
more
divided
because
those
who
run
for
office
tend
to
be
ideologues
who
have
strong
opinions
on
issues
The
new
system
of
picking
candidates
has
helped
lead
to
the
formation
of
a
professional
political
class
described
as
those
who
want
the
jobs
badly
enough
to
dedicate
themselves
to
winning
and
holding
them
The
days
of
the
citizen
politician
it
seems
are
behind
us
What
I
would
like
to
have
seen
more
of
in
the
article
is
an
explanation
of
why
the
idealogues
formed
What
cultural
changes
in
the
United
States
led
to
the
cultural
divide
in
the
first
place
What
radicalized
large
segments
of
the
population
and
started
the
process
that
has
led
to
the
politically
50/50
country
I
agree
with
Rauch
that
the
division
between
the
parties
does
present
voters
with
clear
choices
on
issues
I
also
agree
that
the
choices
are
sometimes
too
clear-cut
voters
with
more
libertarian
leanings
may
feel
left
out
of
the
political
process
for
example
Where
I
disagree
with
Rauch
is
his
statement
that
the
Republican
party
has
acquired
its
distinctively
tart
right-wing
flavor
largely
because
it
has
absorbed
in
fact
to
a
significant
extent
has
organizationally
merged
with
the
religious
right
While
the
characterization
of
right
wing
politics
as
tart
without
a
similar
description
of
those
on
the
left
may
be
unfair
I
think
this
statement
still
doesn't
completely
describe
the
complexities
of
religious
belief
and
how
those
beliefs
lead
to
political
action
or
inaction
on
the
part
of
religious
people
I
recommend
that
Rauch
start
looking
into
the
Christian
subculture
within
American
society
and
the
differences
in
political
opinion
that
exist
within
what
is
too
often
seen
by
the
media
as
a
homogenous
group
In
the
months
leading
up
to
and
after
the
election
Christianity
Today
magazine
published
letters
from
devout
people
who
supported
John
Kerry
My
own
political
opinions
are
not
uniformly
in
line
with
those
of
the
Republican
party
platform
or
the
president
I
am
a
Republican
for
many
of
the
reasons
expressed
in
Rauch's
article
I
feel
the
Democrat
party
has
become
somewhat
hostile
to
those
of
religious
faith
because
it
has
become
defined
by
its
extremists
In
this
way
I
feel
the
article
is
still
somewhat
unfair
to
religious
conservatives
and
the
diversity
of
political
opinion
that
exists
within
the
church
but
is
not
a
slander
of
them

I
Tried
I
Really
Did
I
had
every
intention
of
watching
and
blogging
Governor
John
Baldacci's
State
of
the
State
address
Honest
Was
trying
to
remember
it
throughout
the
day
checked
what
channel
it
was
on
Yeah
you
know
the
rest
I
remembered
it
was
happening
about
halfway
through
the
speech
and
tried
to
watch
it
from
there
but
it
was
impossible
So
I'm
depending
on
the
State
of
Maine
website
and
the
Bangor
Daily
News
The
Maine
website
has
THE
SPEECH
IN
ALL
CAPS
MAKING
IT
SEEM
AS
THOUGH
BALDACCI
WAS
DELIVERING
A
SPITTLE-FLECKED
RANT
AT
THE
ASSEMBLED
LEGISLATORS
Note
to
Maine
all
caps
is
not
easy
to
read
In
the
speech
Baldacci
talked
of
creating
a
research
triangle
that
would
focus
on
biomedical
issues
Sounds
good
but
will
it
bring
more
jobs
Baldacci
and
Maine
legislators
have
got
to
realize
someday
that
it
takes
more
than
just
bond
issues
providing
startup
costs
to
create
jobs
Maine
has
got
to
get
better
at
creating
a
culture
in
which
job
creation
and
entrepreneurship
can
flourish
And
right
now
with
our
high
taxes
and
outrageous
worker's
comp
costs
Maine
is
not
exactly
a
business-friendly
environment
Eh
maybe
next
year
Baldacci
then
talked
of
CREATING
A
TWENTY
ONE
MEMBER...sorry
Creating
a
21-member
Maine
Creative
Economy
Council
Again
he
hopes
to
build
a
vibrant
economy
on
a
foundation
of
investments
in
youth
cultural
institutions
entrepreneurship
and
technology
Spending
money
without
figuring
out
why
businesses
have
been
running
from
Maine
for
decades
The
next
initiative
I
kind
of
like
It
makes
sense
to
me
since
I'm
a
nut
about
having
broadband
access
I
don't
think
I
could
ever
return
to
dial-up
Baldacci
wants
to
ensure
that
90
of
Maine
communities
have
broadband
by
2010
all
of
Maine
is
able
to
connect
with
their
cell
phone
by
2008
have
fun
putting
those
towers
up
near
Camden
Gov
and
the
educational
system
has
a
technology
infrastructure
so
that
kids
can
continue
to
play
Halo
2
without
a
high
ping
rate
Then
he
talks
about
drugs
scholarships
and
the
rest
of
the
filler
that
makes
up
such
speeches
Then
he
slips
something
in
that's
truly
encouraging
Forgive
the
ALL
CAPS
but
I
didn't
want
to
retype
the
entire
section
IN

THE
DEPARTMENT

MAINERS
KNOW
THE
VALUE
OF

AND
OUR

is
good
news
Maine
has
lost
too
many
children
in
the
foster
care
system
to
neglectful
or
abusive
foster
parents
because
of
a
DHS
that
overreacts
and
takes
children
away
from
the
birth
parents
Children
should
only
be
removed
from
a
home
for
abuse
or
severe
neglect
not
at
the
whim
of
a
system
that
thinks
it
knows
best
I
hope
Governor
Baldacci
can
change
the
culture
at
DHS
and
accomplish
this
goal
Overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
speech
I
hope
the

can
deliver
on
some
of
these
promises
and
hope
some
of

So
I
Was
Wrong
Michael
Moore's
Fahrenheit

wasn't
even
nominated
for
an
Academy
Award
The
Passion
of
the
Christ
was
nominated
for

cinematography

and

I
predicted
Moore's
movie
would
be
nominated
and
The
Passion
ignored
I
guess
Hollywood
was
angrier
with
Moore
than
I
thought
So
now
Moore
has
made
a
movie
that
didn't
influence
a
political
election
didn't
get
nominated
for
a
Golden
Globe
and
is
now
shut
out
of
Oscar
nominations
Guess
that
didn't
work

Ah
yes
Another
question
from
Mr
Hewitt
I'm
glad
he
decided
to
continue
this
exercise
in
blogging
after
the
election
Today
he's
asking
bloggers
to
consider
this
passage
On
balance
it
is
probably
healthier
if
religious
conservatives
are
inside
the
political
system
than
if
they
operate
as
insurgents
and
provocateurs
on
the
outside
Better
they
should
write
anti-abortion
planks
into
the
Republican
platform
than
bomb
abortion
clinics
The
same
is
true
of
the
left
The
clashes
over
civil
rights
and
Vietnam
turned
into
street
warfare
partly
because
activists
were
locked
out
of
their
own
party
establishments
and
had
to
fight
literally
to
be
heard
When
Michael
Moore
receives
a
hero's
welcome
at
the
Democratic
National
Convention
we
moderates
grumble
but
if
the
parties
engage
fierce
activists
while
marginalizing
tame
centrists
that
is
probably
better
for
the
social
peace
than
the
other
way
around."The
quote
is
from
a
story
by
Jonathan
Rauch
and
is
from
the
Atlantic
magazine
The
first
thing
that
strikes
me
is
the
subtle
positioning
of
religious
conservatives
as
terrorists
and
of
leftist
protesters
as
fighters
Religious
conservatives
are
described
as
insurgents
and
provocateurs
while
leftists
are
described
as
activists
who
had
to
fight
to
be
heard
Perhaps
I'm
reading
too
much
into
Rauch's
use
of
language
here
but
it's
a
particularly
sensitive
issue
considering
that
before
and
after
September
11
it
was
considered
funny
on
the
left
to
refer
to
Republicans
as
the
American
Taliban
Even
now
the
language
of
religious
intolerance
is
used
to
paint
religious
people
as
the
villains
of
history
Whenever
religion
and
politics
is
discussed
and
Christians
are
the
subject
references
to
the
Crusades
the
puritans
the
Salem
witch
trials
and
other
such
historical
events
will
be
made
It
is
a
common
tactic
of
the
left
to
smear
contemporary
religion
with
the
actions
of
those
in
the
past
The
use
of
such
language
also
shows
a
disturbing
moral
equivalence
by
Rauch
He's
drawing
a
parallel
between
the
violence
of
the
modern-day
terrorists
in
Iraq
and
the
past
violence
of
misguided
pro-life
advocates
Rauch
obviously
has
a
dim
view
of
religion
and
conservatives
His
if
not
A
then
B
approach
to
the
issue
suggests
that
he
sees
all
of
us
who
call
ourselves
evangelicals
and
are
involved
with
the
political
process
as
potential
abortion
clinic
bombers
or
terrorists
In
Rauch's
view
religious
belief
leads
to
violence
but
liberal
activism
leads
to
social
change
This
view
conveniently
ignores
centuries
of
history
in
which
religious
belief
led
men
and
women
to
end
slavery
and
oppression
open
hospitals
universities
orphanages
and
feed
the
hungry
house
the
homeless
and
clothe
the
naked
That
Rauch
ignores
the
voluminous
history
of
Christian
charity
is
a
telling
sign
of
his
worldview
regarding
faith
that
faith
is
a
dangerous
component
to
society
that
needs
the
boundaries
of
a
political
party
to
peacefully
coexist
with
the
culture
What
does
it
say
about
the
Atlantic
First
and
foremost
that
the
loss
of
the
sane
voice
of
Michael
Kelly
has
hurt
the
overall
voice
of
the
magazine
Under
Kelly
the
magazine
was
a
voice
of
political
moderation
and
a
pleasure
to
read
Now
it
seems
to
have
fallen
into
the
swamps
of
leftist
bigotry
against
people
of
faith
Most
of
all
though
this
quote
from
Rauch
shows
that
the
left
still
has
no
idea
what
motivates
Christians
to
get
involved
with
politics
and
no
understanding
of
modern
American
Christianity
When
violence
was
used
by
a
very
few
pro-life
supporters
it
was
rare
and
widely
condemned
by
those
in
the
church
Although
American
Christianity
does
have
its
fringe
element
those
who
espouse
anger
and
hatred
are
consigned
to
the
sidelines
not
invited
to
the
conventions
The
quote
also
shows
how
little
the
left
has
learned
from
its
loss
in
November
2004
They
are
being
advised
to
grow
more
radical
when
they
should
be
looking
at
ways
to
appeal
to
the
center
they
so
badly
lost
last
year
Celebrating
the
acceptance
of
Michael
Moore
is
not
a
sign
of
health
within
the
party
Quite
the
opposite
When
Moore
and
his
deceptive
ilk
were
allowed
into
the
mainstream
of
the
Democrat
party
it
indicated
a
moral
unseriousness
in
the
Democrat
party
Rauch
is
combining
anti-Christian
sentiment
with
bad
advice
for
the
Democrats
If
his
thinking
is
widely
accepted
2006
and
2008
are
sure
to
be
good
years
for
Republican
candidates

This

Here's

I

Reproductive

over

Support

ribbons
people
put
on

I'm
a
resident
of
a
blue
state
and
have
noticed
little
changes
people
have
made
to
their
magnets
In
Camden
someone
had
written
DEMOCRATS
right
before
the
words
Support
the
Troops
Here
in
Bangor
I
noticed
someone
had
added
the
words
NOT
BUSH
after
the
message
about
the
troops
This
seems
to
indicate
that
Democrats
are
twitchy
about
the
possibility
they
may
be
seen
as
militaristic
Bush-supporting
nutjobs
by
adding
the
magnets
to
their
cars
Why
can't
the
party
do
simple
patriotism
that
well
When
the
American
flag
was
displayed
after
September
11
some
liberals
went
crazy
most
notably
those
in
the
news
business
News
executives
forbade
employees
from
wearing
flag
pins
on

the
first
evidence
of
a
disconnect
with
the
public
that
would
come
back
to
haunt
them
in
the
form
of
low
ratings
and
declining
circulations
The
addition
of
anti-Bush
or
pro-Democrat
slogans
to
a
simple
statement
of
support
for
the
troops
is
sad
Why
can't
they
just
allow
the
statements
to
speak
for
themselves

Super

Ads
This

Super

ads
will
be
cleaner

last
according
to
the
Fox

I
know
there
will
be
some
who
will
scream
censorship
and
somehow
blame
John
Ashcroft
but
this
is
encouraging
news
to
me
Many
people
watch
the
Super
Bowl
with
children
or
in
large
groups
at
churches
or
community
centers
There's
nothing
worse
than
sitting
in

large
group
with
kids
around
wondering
when
you're
going

hit

The
crude

Kingmaker
Hugh
Hewitt
defends
James
Dobson
in
at
least
three
separate
posts
on
his
website
I
think
the
SpongeBob
episode
was
overblown
and
am
annoyed
at
myself
for
believing
the
New
York
Times
However
I
still
think
Dobson
is
a
poor
leader
for
the
religious
conservative
movement
Unfortunately
he
doesn't
see
things
that
way
In
a
broadcast
shortly
after
the
November
election
Dobson
expressed
how
grateful
he
was
that
Mr
Bush
was
re-elected
and
he
criticized
Democrats
and
the
media
But
Dobson
also
issued
a
pointed
warning
to
the
Republican
Party
If
they
get
disinterested
in
the
values
of
the
people
who
put
them
in
office
as
they
have
done
in
the
past
if
that
happens
again
I
believe
the
Republican
Party
will
pay
an
enormous
price
in
four
years
and
maybe
two
Dobson
said.Left
unspoken
is
the
threat
that
Dobson
has
made
in
the
past
that
he
will
be
the
one
who
helps
make
them
pay
that
price
This
shows
that
while
Dobson
is
a
fine
psychiatrist
with
impeccable
credentials
and
experience
in
his
chosen
field
he
should
stay
out
of
politics
It
is
this
sort
of
political
petulance
that
has
led
to
the
very
problems
Dobson
complains
about
In
1992
religious
conservatives
didn't
like
President
George
H.W
Bush
and
many
of
them
stayed
home
on
election
day
This
inaction
led
to
eight
years
of
an
administration
that
appointed
hundreds
of
federal
judges
three
Supreme
Court
members
and
hired
countless
civil
servants
to
posts
in
essential
federal
agencies
Judges
appointed
to
lifetime
terms
are
the
source
of
most
complaints
by
social
conservatives
such
as
Dobson
While
the
odd
piece
of
legislation
may
arise
from
time
to
time
such
as
the
partial-birth
abortion
ban
the
majority
of
political
battles
over
the
next
decade
are
likely
to
involve
the
federal
judiciary
The
problem
is
one
between
principle
and
pragmatism
Religious
life
operates
in
the
realm
of
principle
what's
right
what's
wrong
no
middle
ground
Politics
is
more
pragmatic
numbers
majorities
what
works
compromise
Unfortunately
most
religious
conservatives
come
to
politics
with
the
expectation
that
politicians
they
support
will
legislate
principles
in
grand
gestures
and
make
sweeping
changes
not
realizing
that
politics
is
a
game
of
inches
Principles
are
protected
by
passing
one
piece
of
pragmatic
legislation
at
a
time
Principles
are
also
protected
by
ensuring
friendly
judges
are
appointed
to
the
bench
This
is
where
the
my
way
or
we
stay
home
approach
of
Dobson
fails
The
judges
appointed
by
the
Clinton
administration
have
the
potential
to
do
more
damage
to
the
values
Dobson
and
co
hold
dear
than
any
politician
elected
to
office
But
it's
elected
officials
that
nominate
and
approve
judges
so
if
we
stay
home
on
election
day
we're
practically
handing
control
of
the
judiciary
over
to
those
who
disagree
with
us
The
major
problem
I
have
with
James
Dobson
is
his
penchant
for
making
all
or
nothing
threats
against
Republicans
without
realizing
the
effect
his
actions
have
where
it
really
counts
If
Dobson
stays
home
on
election
day
2006
and
counsels
his
audience
to
do
the
same
the
era
of
conservative
judges
and
legislation
ends
If
Dobson
really
wants
to
make
a
difference
he
should
encourage
people
in
his
audience
to
work
on
the
grassroots
level
and
ensure
that
good
conservatives
win
statewide
office
He
should
also
realize
that
politics
doesn't
follow
the
same
rules
as
religious
belief
and
sometimes
practicality
is
necessary
Better
to
get
half
a
loaf
now
and
wait
for
the
rest
than
not
eat
at
all
If
Dobson
wants
to
know
why
Republicans
often
ignore
the
principles
of
religious
conservatives
he
need
look
no
further
than
his
own
statement
above
If
religious
conservatives
want
to
be
part
of
the
base
they
should
refrain
from
threatening
to
bolt
every
time
they
don't
get
their
way
In
politics
dependability
is
key
to
influence
and
petulance
doesn't
command
respect

And
It
Begins
Social
conservatives
are
upset
over
the
report
that
President
Bush
will
not
spend
political
capital
on
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
Tony
Perkins
of
the
Family
Research
Council
is
so
upset
that
he's
losing
all
perspective
I
believe
there
is
no
more
important
issue
for
the
president's
second
term
than
the
preservation
of
marriage.""No
more
important
issue
huh
Not
a
thing
that's
more
important
than
passing
a
largely
symbolic
law
Pardon
me
while
I
kick
something
No
wait...I'm
at
work
Deep
breaths
then
Okay
There
are
plenty
of
reasons
to
be
annoyed
at
this
statement
Let
me
deal
first
with
the
obvious
President
Bush
has
a
lot
on
his
plate
this
term
A
lot
Like
a
war
in
Iraq
that's
part
of
a
global
war
on
terror
lot
Maybe
Mr
Perkins
hasn't
noticed
but
some
Islamic
terrorists
killed
a
whole
bunch
of
people
a
few
years
back
They
want
to
keep
killing
us
and
the
president
wants
to
keep
them
from
doing
that
Some
in
Congress
are
fighting
this
effort
tooth
and
nail
and
the
president
is
expending
a
lot
of
political
capital
keeping
the
war
effort
going
Obvious
point
number
2
it's
actually
the
Senate
on
which
Mr
Perkins
should
focus
his
attention
The
votes
are
not
there
I
can
name
two
senators
who
wouldn't
vote
for
the
FMA
and
they're
both
Republicans
and
both
from
Maine
Sixty-seven
votes
are
needed
to
pass
a
constitutional
amendment
Republicans
only
hold
55
seats
and
we've
already
eliminated
two
votes
from
that
number
That
leaves
53
and
not
all
of
them
would
vote
for
the
measure
So
you'd
have
to
get
at
absolute
minimum
14
or
15
Democrats
to
vote
with
you
on
this
bill
These
guys
aren't
going
to
listen
to
a
president
most
of
them
hate
The
math
doesn't
work
Semi-obvious
point
conservatives
don't
have
a
lot
of
credibility
on
the
issue
of
preserving
marriage
Here's
something
I
wrote
back
in
June
A
few
months
ago
pop
star
Britney
Spears
was
married
for
just
over
50
hours
When
asked
to
explain
her
quick
marriage
and
annullment
she
explained
the
whole
thing
as
being
a
joke
between
two
friends
Conservatives
said
little
about
her
pseudo-marriage
and
lost
an
opportunity
to
bolster
their
credibility
on
the
issue
of
protecting
marriage
If
marriage
is
sacred
then
conservatives
should
treat
it
as
such
regardless
of
the
sexual
orientation
of
those
involved
The
silence
of
conservatives
and
the
church
on
the
increasingly
light
treatment
of
marriage
by
society
makes
the
entire
idea
of
the
FMA
look
more
anti-gay
than
pro-marriage
The
church's
behavior
in
the
areas
of
cohabitation
and
divorce
further
erode
its
credibility
on
the
issue
of
preserving
marriage
George
Barna
has
made
a
career
out
of
surveying
the
Christian
community
and
the
general
population
about
religious
topics
His
findings
on
how
Christians
treat
divorce
and
cohabitation
are
disappointing
25
of
born
again
Christians
had
cohabitated
Born
again
Christians
are
just
as
likely
to
get
divorced
as
are
non-born
again
adults
Overall
33
of
all
born
again
individuals
who
have
been
married
have
gone
through
a
divorce
which
is
statistically
identical
to
the
34
incidence
among
non-born
again
adults.Barna
found
that
over
90
of
those
who
experienced
divorce
did
so
after
making
a
committment
to
Christ
not
before
These
numbers
show
an
appalling
lack
of
respect
for
the
institution
of
marriage
among
self-proclaimed
followers
of
Christ
and
is
a
huge
weakness
in
the
argument
that
an
amendment
to
define
marriage
as
between
a
man
and
a
woman
would
protect
the
institution
The
church's
behavior
undercuts
its
argument
and
it's
a
shame...Instead
of
fighting
the
weakening
of
marriage
at
the
beginning
the
FMA
seems
both
a
belated
and
half-hearted
attempt
at
protecting
the
social
institution
we've
allowed
to
decline
for
so
many
years.Barna's
numbers
should
shame
social
conservatives
and
give
a
measure
of
humility
to
the
Tony
Perkinses
of
the
world
I
know
that
groups
like
the
Family
Research
Council
and
Focus
on
the
Family
have
done
quite
a
bit
to
help
married
couples
realize
the
importance
of
the
institution
but
given
the
terrible
numbers
from
Barna
more
work
needs
to
be
done
If
social
conservatives
want
to
have
any
credibility
on
this
issue
they
need
to
begin
that
work
immediately
For
years
a
myopic
focus
on
gay
and
lesbian
relationships
has
allowed
them
to
ignore
the
problems
and
the
hard
work
necessary
to
fix
them
in
their
own
community

I
agree

the
Captain
that

It

to
me

the
effect

Twice

once
on
the
radio
and
once
at

I
heard
people
asking
why
so
much
money
has
to
be
spent
on
the
inaugural
Ann
Coulter
uses
her
column
to
put
this

talking
point
in

There

be
no

The
speech
reads
very
well
It
was
delivered
about
as
well
as
Bush
ever
delivers
a
speech
I'm
a
fan
but
am
well
aware
of
his
shortcomings
There
are
many
lines
worth
mentioning
I
recommend
reading
the
speech
In
the
second
reading
I
was
very
impressed
with
the
goals
Bush
has
set
for
the
second
term

The
Speech
Not
bad
Not
very
flowery
but
made
its
point
clearly
especially
at
the
end
Liberals
are
going
to
scream
about
this
one
quite
a
bit
I
think
Okay
I'm
going
to
take
some
time
off

First
the

speech

then
the

Pre-Inaugural
Schadenfreude
Just
for
fun
I
trolled
the
DU
boards
tonight
I'm
really
an
evil
man
taking
a
small
degree
of
pleasure
in
the
emotional
pain
and
anger
of
the
Bush-haters
But
I
just
can't
help
myself
This
year
I
helped
out
with
the
campaign
and
was
called
some
nasty
names
on
the
phone
I
had
my
lawn
sign
stolen
once
and
caught
a
Dem
in
the
act
of
stealing
my
neighbor's
sign
For
the
past
four
years
Bush
supporters
have
put
up
with
the
infantile
behavior
of
the
Democrats
and
endured
the
hatred
of
those
who
think
it's
funny
to
call
people
nazis
bigots
theocrats
fascists
and
other
less
polite
terms
It
was
a
hard
campaign
season
So
pardon
me
if
I
find
this
sort
of
thing
kind
of
funny
By
the
way
these
are
printed
as-is
with
no
correction
to

or

Only
strong
profanity
has
been
removed
Wear
black

Just
an
idea
guys
some
of
you
said
it
before
I
think
is
the
exact
way
to
mark
the
opening
of
a
very
dark
era
in
the
USA
I
hope
NOBODY
here
is
going
to
watch
the
circus
on
TV
Looking
forward
to
live
again
one
day
in

The
deppression
is
setting
in
BIG
time
I
can't
even
imagine
how
it
will
be
on
Thursday
when
bush
officially
steals
his
second
straight
election
I
know
John
K
won
the
election
I
know
it
will
take
a
long
time
to
prove
it
if
it
can
be
proven
Please
DON'T
refer
to
the
POS
as
the
Pres"....it
gives
him
a
semblance
of
legitimacy
that
he
does
not
deserve
KERRY

There
is
another
matter
though
that
really
needs
to
be
aired
in
Democratic
circle
that
the
election
system
was
a
fraud
GOING
IN
I
think
we
had
a
catastrophic
failure
of
leadership
on
this
matter-Kerry
included-but
he
was
not
alone
in
failing
to
insure
an
honest
election
or
in
failing
to
at

warn

is
looking
for
a
funeral
tomorrow
to
offer
balance
to
their
broadcast
of

That

I
can
summon
Tomorrow

probably
blame

fire
him

her
but
the
blogosphere
shouldn't
let
them
get
away
with
this
nonsense
this
miserable
exercise
in
Bush-bashing
During
the
campaign
the
media
threw
a
stink
when
images
from
the
terror
attacks
of
September
11
were
used
in
a
Bush
campaign
commercial
How
is
this
different
This
is
in
fact
much
worse
At
least
the
Bush
ads
had
some
sense
of
decorum
Given
the
tone
of
their

Peter

might
as
well
use
the
bloody
shirt
of
a

to
wipe

The

agree

A
Mainstream
Blogger
I'm
about
halfway
through
Hugh
Hewitt's
new
book
Blog
I
was
impressed
by
his
use
of
the
Protestant
Reformation
as
an
example
of
how
emerging
technology
can
change
the
course
of
history
His
discussions
of
the
four
founding
myths
of
the
blogosphere
was
a
good
short
history
of
the
effect
blogs
have
had
on
recent
events
I
started
blogging
mostly
becuase
I
was
bored
and
it
seemed
like
a
good
way
to
keep
writing
My
earliest
influences
were
Andrew
Sullivan
and
Instapundit
Hugh's
book
is
good
not
just
because
of
its
discussions
on
blog
history
but
because
it
gives
bloggers
like
me
a
chance
to
see
the
bigger
picture
and
how
blogs
are
evolving
as
the
new
technology
drives
them
forward
Some
blogs
that
is
One
of
the
bloggers
I
most
admired
doesn't
seem
to
understand
the
blogosphere
or
read
many
blogs
But
the
notion
that
our
debates
have
to
be
about
whose
side
are
you
on
in
terms
of
domestic
politics
strikes
me
as
depressing
I
understand
that
partisanship
isn't
always
bad
and
indeed
inevitable
But
the
way
in
which
the
blogosphere
has
become
more
partisan
over
the
last
few
years
rather
than
less
strikes
me
as
a
disappointment
WHAT
BLOGS
CAN
DO
Why
Because
part
of
the
point
of
blogging
as
a
medium
is
that
it
empowers
the
individual
In
big
media
the
pressures
of
conformity
can
be
as
great
as
they
are
subtle
At
the
Boston
Globe
or
the
Washington
Times
you
know
what
you're
getting
How
many
columnists
in
the
mainstream
media
can
be
described
as
unpredictable
in
partisan
terms
How
many
liberal
columnists
ever
praise
the
president
occasionally
How
many
conservative
ones
tear
him
a
new
one
from
time
to
time
This
is
a
moment
to
thank
God
for
Tom
Friedman
by
the
way
The
reason
is
subtle
pressure
from
suits
and
colleagues
and
readers
But
the
point
of
blogging
is
that
it
can
liberate
you
from
such
pressures
A
political
hybrid
has
a
secure
outlet
at
last
his
or
her
own
So
why
then
the
preponderance
of
the
partisans
I
know
that's
what
happens
more
generally
in
a
polarized
polity
But
the
blogosphere
had
the
potential
to
be
a
solvent
of
this
rigidity
Instead
it
has
become
yet
another
reflection
of
it
with
a
few
honorable
exceptions
Or
have
I
missed
some
blogs
in
this
regard
that
deserve
more
exposure?I
think
Sullivan's
question
is
rhetorical
Of
course
he's
missed
a
few
blogs
I
am
a
mostly
partisan
blogger
The
behavior
of
the
Democrats
over
the
past
few
years
has
made
me
more
partisan
I
don't
hesitate
however
to
criticize
social
conservatives
when
I
think
admonishment
is
deserved
If
Sullivan
were
reading
a
good
selection
of
bloggers
he
would
have
noticed
Polipundit
criticizing
the
president's
immigration
proposal
Hugh
Hewitt
telling
Republicans
that
the
trashing
of
Arlen
Specter
was
a
bad
idea
National
Review's
Corner
constantly
disagreeing
with
the
president
on
immigration
education
and
other
issues
Ace
of
Spades
among
others
has
expressed
a
wish
for
a
strong
Democratic
party
Conservative
bloggers
were
stronger
critics
of
Armstrong
Williams
than
liberal
bloggers
were
of
Kos
This
blog
has
expressed
strong
disagreement
with
the
president
over
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
Sullivan
seems
to
think
ideas
and
partisanship
are
mutually
exclusive
Just
because
I
tend
to
support
one
political
party
over
another
doesn't
necessarily
make
me
a
mindless
drone
controlled
by
the
eeeevil
Karl
Rove
With
his
assertions
Sullivan
is
trying
to
make
himself
out
as
the
only
true
independent
voice
in
the
blogsophere
Like
William
Safire
Sullivan
equates
independent
thought
with
contrarian
leanings
It's
no
wonder
his
favorite
senator
is
John
McCain
whose
political
career
seems
defined
by
his
constant
need
for
positive
attention
from
the
media
With
this
post
Sullivan
hasn't
explicitly
joined
the
ranks
of
those
who
see
a
Republican
conspiracy
behind
conservative
bloggers
but
he's
certainly
moved
one
step
closer
Once
again
Sullivan
is
showing
one
of
his
more
disagreeable
traits
subtle
smearing
of
those
who
don't
follow
what
he
considers
the
right
way
of
thinking
In
the
end
I
think
Sullivan
has
to
learn
the
difference
between
unity
and
unanimity
Conservative
bloggers
are
mostly
unified
in
our
belief
that
the
war
is
the
right
thing
to
do
but
we
differ
in
our
specific
beliefs
about
the
efficacy
of
particular
policies
If
Sullivan
doesn't
see
that
then
he's
simply
not
reading
enough
blogs
Maybe
he
should
start
by
reading
a
copy
of
Hugh's
book
Mr
Hewitt
have
you
sent
him
a
copy
yet

John
Kerry
refused
to
denounce
the
moonbats
during
the
2004
election
So
now
he's
kept
the
online
domain
name
dumped
Edwards
from
the
masthead
and
is
starting
his
own
internet
refuge
for
those
who
just
can't
admit
defeat
From
the
front
page
johnkerry.com
is
a
community
of
online
activists
first
brought
together
in
the
heat
of
the
2004
presidential
campaign
In
2005
we
continue
to
work
side-by-side
to
rewrite
the
book
on
grassroots
politics.And
it's
a
book
that
desperately
needs
rewriting
given
how
badly
the
liberal
grassroots
policy
did
in
the
last
election
What's
going
unsaid
is
that
this
is
also
a
desperate
attempt
to
stay
relevant
as
an
individual
rather
than
simply
a
repository
for
Bush-hatred
Your
involvement
counts
now
more
than
ever
The
Bush
administration
is
advancing
a
right
wing
assault
on
the
values
and
ideals
we
hold
most
deeply
Healthy
debate
and
diverse
opinion
are
being
eliminated
from
the
State
Department
and
CIA
and
the
cabinet
is
being
remade
to
rubber
stamp
policies
that
will
undermine
Social
Security
balloon
the
deficit
avoid
real
reforms
in
health
care

John
America
rejected
your
negative
message
last
November

repeating
it
over

over

won't

appealing
In
fact
it
just
sounds
kinda
pathetic
now
that
the

is
over

the

has
been
re-elected
This
paragraph
makes
it
obvious
that
Kerry
is
not
a
man
who
learns
from
his
mistakes
Instead
of
offering
bold
new
ideas
he
recycles
the

stump
speech
and
formats
it
into

This
is
not
a

retreat

accommodate

it

firm.Stand

encourages
bloggers
to
start
thinking
about
2006
Ugh
I
know
the
midterm
elections
are
important
to
getting
President
Bush's
agenda
passed
but
it's
hard
for
me
to
start
thinking
about
another
campaign
season
Poli
is
asking
for
support
of
Santorum
I
know
he's
a
good
conservative
and
a
fighter
for
principle
but
he
threw
some
of
that
capital
away
with
his
support
of
Senator
Scottishlaw
Arlen
Specter
Conservatives
in
Pennsylvania
weren't
able
to
punish
Specter
but
they
may
choose
to
take
out
their
anger
on
Santorum
We
only
have
one
race
that
could
get
interesting
here
in
Maine
Senator
Olympia
Snowe
is
up
for
re-election
in
06
Personally
I
have
my
doubts
as
to
whether
she'll
even
run
again
I
get
the
sense
that
she's
getting
tired
of
Washington
and
wants
to
settle
into
a
quiet
or
less
stressful
private
career
This
speculation
isn't
the
result
of
any
tip
or
inside
information
just
a
hunch
If
she
does
choose
not
to
run
again
the
Democrats
have
a
good
opportunity
to
pick
off
a
Republican
RINO
anyway
seat
If
Snowe
steps
down
I
predict
current
representatives
Mike
Michaud
and
Tom
Allen
will
both
run
for
the
open
seat
on
the
Democrat
side
along
with
a
few
others
Chellie
Pingree
Joe
Perry
and
Dan
Tremble
The
surprise
candidate
would
be
Maine
Governor
John
Baldacci
The
Republican
bench
is
a
bit
more
shallow
but
there
is
definately
some
talent
Running
for
the
seat
will
be
Peter
Cianchette
Randy
Bumps
Brian
Hamel
and
maybe
Tom
Sawyer
Unless
something
dramatic
happens
this
blog
will
be
around
to
cover
the
race
and
perhaps
blog
my
own
in
2006
or
2008
I
hope
to
run
for
a
seat
in
the
state
legislature
Okay
maybe
I'm
not
as
tired
of
campaigns
as
I
thought

Avoiding
Disaster
There
has
been
more
violence
in
Iraq
as
the
elections
get
closer
During
the
campaign
the
cry
of
the
Democrats
was
to
give
the
United
Nations
a
bigger
role
in
the
election
process
Once
again
events
in
that
country
have
shown
the
wisdom
of
the
president
and
the
weakness
of
his
critics
Carlos
Valenzuela
the
chief
U.N
election
adviser
in
Iraq
said
the
intimidation
of
electoral
workers
by
guerrillas
seeking
to
derail
this
month's
balloting
is
high
and
very
serious
But
Valenzuela
told
reporters
Tuesday
that
only
a
sustained
onslaught
by
insurgents
or
the
mass
resignation
of
electoral
workers
will
prevent
this
month's
national
elections
from
going
ahead.Thanks
for
the
idea
Carlos
Now
that
the
terrorists
know
what
it
will
take
to
disrupt
elections
maybe
they'll
try
it
After
suffering
losses
in
a
car
bomb
attack
the
UN
cut
and
run
from
Iraq
after
the
war
Given
their
disagreement
with
the
effort
in
the
first
place
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
looking
for
an
excuse
and
terrorists
gave
them
one
Now
the
UN
is
giving
terrorists
a
blueprint
how
to
disrupt
the
election
process
There
will
be
more
attacks
as
the
elections
grow
closer
The
insurgents
know
that
once
people
take
the
levers
of
power
themselves
the
effectiveness
of
terror
is
weakened
What
the
UN
should
have
said
is
what
President
Bush
has
been
saying
all
along
no
matter
what
happens
people
will
vote
on
January
30
The
terrorists
will
get
no
victory
The
UN
should
not
have
given
them
encouragement

ENOUGH
Okay
I
get
it
Vietnam
was
a
big
deal
the
defining
event
of
a
generation
the
end
of
American
hubris
in
foreign
affairs
and
the
rise
of
a
new
political
ethic
I
understand
all
of
that
Can
we
stop
talking
about
it
now
In
a
recent
speech
Senator
Ted
Kennedy
called
Iraq
George
Bush's
Vietnam
Senator
Joe
Biden
brought
up
Vietnam
today
at
Condoleeza
Rice's
confirmation
hearings
No
war
captivates
the
Democrats
like
the
conflict
fought
in
southeast
Asia
over
30
years
ago
During
the
recent
presidential
campaign
Senator
John
Kerry
famously
brought
up
his
service
in
Vietnam
at
every
available
opportunity
To
Democrats
Vietnam
is
a
word
with
talismanic
powers
giving
anyone
who
utters
it
the
immediate
upper
hand
in
any
debate
about
U.S
foreign
policy
What
bunk
When
a
politician
mentions
Vietnam
it
doesn't
make
me
reconsider
the
foreign
policy
goals
of
a
particular
administration
Instead
it
demonstrates
to
me
a
lack
of
intellectual
growth
in
the
person
who
brings
it
up
Liberals
love
to
accuse
conservatives
of
lacking
intellectual
curiosity
but
it
seems
to
me
they
are
the
ones
who
cannot
move
past
their
preconceived
notions
and
stubborn
insistence
on
comparing
every
conflict
to
the
one

most

Wah
In
the
story
about
John
Kerry
linked
below
the
Democratic
presidential
candidate
is
still
complaining
about
voter
disenfranchisement
He
still
cannot
accept
it
seems
that
he
lost
because
people
didn't
like
him
Voting
machines
were
distributed
in
uneven
ways
In
Democratic
districts
it
took
people
four
five
eleven
hours
to
vote
while
Republicans
went
through
in
10
minutes
same
voting
machines
same
process
our
America...In
a
nation
which
is
willing
to
spend
several
hundred
million
dollars
in
Iraq
to
bring
them
democracy
we
cannot
tolerate
that
too
many
people
here
in
America
were
denied
that
democracy"Kerry
is
attempting
here
to
create
a
legend
a
fairy
tale
to
explain
his
loss
To
me
it's
more
proof
that
the
Democrat
party
lacks
a
strong
leader
someone
who
could
reign
in
this
nonsense
and
get
the
party
talking
about
issues
instead
of
complaining
about
invented
persecutions
If
Kerry
is
so
concerned
about
the
integrity
of
the
vote
why
isn't
he
speaking
out
against
those
disenfranchised
by
what
appears
to
be
fraud
in
Washington
state
and
Wisconsin
Where
is
his
outrage
over
how
a
United
States
Senator
and
a
handful
of
representatives
attempted
to
disenfranchise
the
62
million
people
who
voted
for
the
president
His
selective
outrage
suggests
principle
has
little
to
do
with
his
statements
if
Kerry
could
have
stolen
the
election
he
would
have
Maybe
he's
just
angry
that
Bush
won
with
enough
of
a
margin
to
ruin
his

Expanding
the
Dream
I
didn't
write
anything
about
Martin
Luther
King
Jr
or
his
legacy
yesterday
Partially
because
I
was
busy
and
didn't
have
time
to
formulate
my
thoughts
partially
because
I
didn't
feel
I
had
much
to
add
to
what
was
already
being
said
Now
though
I
have
a
local
angle
the
annual
MLK
Breakfast
at
the
University
of
Maine
At
the
event
speakers
said
King's
dream
remained
unfulfilled
That's
what
this
is
about
keeping
Dr
King's
dream
alive
Maine
Attorney
General
G
Steven
Rowe
said
Monday
Rowe
and
other
speakers
including
UMaine
acting
President
Robert
Kennedy
and
2nd
District
U.S
Rep
Michael
Michaud
stressed
that
King's
dream
was
more
than
just
a
quest
for
civil
rights
King's
goal
was
one
of
economic
and
human
equality
and
fairness
for
all
they
said
Today
37
years
after
Dr
King's
death
the
gap
between
the
haves
and
the
have-nots
has
never
been
wider
Rowe
said
He
noted
that
in
addition
to
economic
divides
more
than
45
million
Americans
are
without
health
insurance
Because
of
that
Dr
King's
dream
is
not
fully
realized
Rowe
said.For
years
liberals
have
been
trying
to
use
the
magnificent
words
of
King
to
advocate
all
sorts
of
policies
that
they
say
the
civil
rights
leader
would
have
supported
Personally
I
think
putting
words
into
the
mouth
of
a
dead
man
is
in
poor
taste
especially
when
your
words
and
your
dreams
seem
so
much
smaller
than
the
words
and
dreams
spoken
in
August
of
1963
I
have
a
dream
that
one
day
this
nation
will
rise
up
and
live
out
the
true
meaning
of
its
creed
We
hold
these
truths
to
be
self-evident
that
all
men
are
created
equal
I
have
a
dream
that
one
day
on
the
red
hills
of
Georgia
the
sons
of
former
slaves
and
the
sons
of
former
slave
owners
will
be
able
to
sit
down
together
at
the
table
of
brotherhood
I
have
a
dream
that
one
day
even
the
state
of
Mississippi
a
state
sweltering
with
the
heat
of
injustice
sweltering
with
the
heat
of
oppression
will
be
transformed
into
an
oasis
of
freedom
and
justice
I
have
a
dream
that
my
four
little
children
will
one
day
live
in
a
nation
where
they
will
not
be
judged
by
the
color
of
their
skin
but
by
the
content
of
their
character
I
have
a
dream
today
I
have
a
dream
that
one
day
down
in
Alabama
with
its
vicious
racists
with
its
governor
having
his
lips
dripping
with
the
words
of
interposition
and
nullification
one
day
right
down
in
Alabama
little
black
boys
and
black
girls
will
be
able
to
join
hands
with
little
white
boys
and
white
girls
as
sisters
and
brothers
I
have
a
dream
today
I
have
a
dream
that
one
day
every
valley
shall
be
exalted
and
every
hill
and
mountain
shall
be
made
low
the
rough
places
will
be
made
plain
and
the
crooked
places
will
be
made
straight
and
the
glory
of
the
Lord
shall
be
revealed
and
all
flesh
shall
see
it
together
This
is
our
hope
This
is
the
faith
that
I
will
go
back
to
the
South
with
With
this
faith
we
will
be
able
to
hew
out
of
the
mountain
of
despair
a
stone
of
hope
With

faith
we
will
be
able
to
transform
the
jangling
discords
of

we

struggle
together
to
go
to

together
to
stand
up

together
knowing
that
we
will

And

the
day
this

be
the
day
when
all
of
God's
children
will
be
able
to
sing
with
new

My
country
tis
of
thee
sweet
land
of
liberty
of
thee
I
sing
Land
where
my
fathers
died
land
of
the
Pilgrim's
pride
from
every
mountainside
let
freedom
ring
And
if
America
is
to
be
a
great
nation
this
must
become
true.Surely
these
words
deserve
better
than
to
suffer
the
indignities
of
Rowe's
interpretation
They
certainly
deserve
better
than
the
spin
John
Kerry
gave
them
Would
King
even
recognize
those
who
call
themselves
his
allies
Would
he

they've
done

how

was
spent
by
Hollywood
last
night
as

celebrated
themselves

Globe

Not
just
the
cost

itself

the

the

afterward
the
transportation
all
of
it
And
couldn't
that
money
have
been
better
spent
on
tsunami
victims
or
clothing
and
feeding
the

If
it's
a

Using
Capital
Wisely
President
Bush
has
just
made
a
wise
decision
In
an
interview
with
the
Washington
Post
the
president
says
he
doesn't
plan
to
spend
political
capital
fighting
for
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
I've
never
been
a
fan
of
the
FMA
as
I
believe
it
violates
the
rights
of
states
to
make
decisions
regarding
gay
marriage
Personally
I
don't
think
gay
marriage
is
a
particularly
good
idea
but
I'm
open
to
the
idea
of
civil
unions
as
a
compromise
measure
between
the
two
extremes
Pro-family
groups
like
the
Family
Research
Council
are
going
to
be
upset
about
this
decision
and
will
likely
make
a
lot
of
noise
in
the
coming
days
about
feeling
betrayed
etc
Politically
though
the
president
had
no
choice
Sixty-seven
votes
are
needed
to
pass
the
amendment
in
the
Senate
The
votes
are
simply
not
there
and
no
amount
of
political
pressure
would
move
those
against
the
FMA
to
vote
for
it
Either
that
or
the
amount
of
watering-down
needed
to
make
the
amendment
palatable
to
moderate
Democrats
and
liberal
Republicans
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
passing
the
FMA
at
all
Then
there's
the
bigger
political
picture
This
term
the
president
has
already
planned
to
fight
for
tort
reform
social
security
reform
and
a
restructuring
of
the
tax
code
Not
to
mention
the
small
matter
of
a
war
against
an
enemy
that
wants
us
all
dead
These
are
all
important
issues
that
deserve
presidential
and
congressional
attention
Fighting
for
a
lost
cause
like
the
FMA
to
appease
one-issue
social
conservatives
is
politically
short-sighted
especially
since
the
battle
is
already
being
won
overwhelmingly
on
the
state
level
In
eleven
states
gay
marriage
was
on
the
ballot
Voters
in
all
eleven
states
rejected
the
idea
of
gay
marriage
in
many
cases
overwhelmingly
Why
refight
a
politically
costly
battle
on
the
federal
level
when
it
makes
no
practical
political
sense
Advocates
of
gay
marriage
have
no
one
but
themselves
and
their
allies
to
blame
for
this
defeat
From
the
Massachusetts
Supreme
Court
to
Gavin
Newsom
of
San
Francisco
supporters
of
gay
marriage
overreached
and
set
their
own
cause
back
by
years
They
tried
to
force
acceptance
of
gay
marriage
onto
the
American
people
through
judicial
fiat
and
have
been
defeated
in
their
attempts
Some
will
want
to
keep
trying
but
for
the
most
part
I
think
this
is
an
issue
that
most
people
will
want
to
ignore
for
awhile
Social
conservatives
have
to
get
serious
about
their
support
for
federalism
On
the
one
hand
they
advocate
the
overturning
of
Roe
v
Wade
saying
decisions
on
abortion
laws
need
to
be
made
on
the
state
level
On
the
other
they're
calling
for
overreaching
federal
regulations
to
protect
a
social
institution
The
principles
that
define
conservatism
cannot
be
selectively
applied
if
conservatives
wish
to
retain
political
viability
The
Democratic
party
is
suffering
a
loss
of
power
because
for
years
they
put
political
expediency
pleasing
interest
groups
before
principles
that
once
held
the
party
together
With
their
support
of
the
FMA
Republicans
are
in
danger
of
falling
into
the
same
trap
The
president's
decision
has
helped
prevent
a
crisis
in
the
party
I
hope
social
conservatives
who
feel
tempted
to
criticize
President
Bush
realize
this
and
hold
off
on
their
condemnation
There
are
a
lot
of
important
battles
ahead
It
would
be
extremely
petty
of
social
conservatives
to
handicap
the
president
before
the
first
skirmishes
even
begin

Pettiness
as
Political
Philosophy
Now
they're
whining
about
the
cost
of
the
inaugural
festivities
The
AP
story
linked
is
an
embarrassment
it's
practically
a
DNC
press
release
How
about
doing
a
story
detailing
what
the
money
George
Soros
donated
to
various
liberal
527s
would
have
purchased
Needless
to
say
we
likely
would
not
see
this
level
of
examination
if
a
President
Kerry
were
being
inaugurated
The
Democrats
ran
the
last
campaign
as
though
Bush-hatred
was
enough
to
convince
a
majority
of
Americans
that
John
Kerry
would
make
a
good
president
They
did
not
engage
the
electorate
with
ideas
or
policy
proposals
they
simply
threw
mud
at
the
president
and
waited
for
us
to
vote
him
out
of
office
It
didn't
work
As
Michael
Barone
noted
after
the
election
love
was
stronger
than
hate
One
would
think
they
would
have
learned
this
lesson
after
losing
the
presidency
and
losing
seats
in
both
houses
of
Congress
It
seems
though
that
the
ass
is
an
appropriate
mascot
for
the
current
crop
of
Democrats
stubborn
insistence
on
losing
strategies
is
the
new
mantra
of
a
dying
party
The
first
evidence
of
this
particular
learning
disability
came
on
election
night
when
John
Kerry
refused
to
concede
until
the
next
day
thus
setting
the
stage
for
the
ridiculous
spectacle
of
trying
to
turn
Ohio
2004
into
Florida
2000
Accepting
defeat
was
not
an
option
they
had
to
continue
the
victimization
myth
that
had
done
nothing
for
them
in
2002
The
next
indication
came
when
the
new
talking
point
about
Bush's
win
was
released
51
percent
was
not
a
mandate
It
was
basically
a
tie
they
argued
Nevermind
that
a
Democrat
candidate
hasn't
won
over
50
percent
of
the
vote
since
Lyndon
Johnson
History
is
irrelevant
to
spin
The
total
number
of
Bush
votes
would
eventually
reach
61
million
more
than
the
entire
population
of
France
The
recount
in
Ohio
and
the
Kerry
campaign's
role
in
it
was
the
next
Democrat
attempt
to
continue
the
losing
strategy
of
Bush-hatred
The
recount
gave
Kerry
an
additional
300
votes
or
so
Then
came
the
counting
of
the
electoral
votes
in
Congress
For
the
first
time
in
decades
the
electors
of
a
state
were
challenged
and
over
30
Democrats
voted
to
disenfranchise
62
million
voters
by
trying
to
throw
out
the
results
of
a
presidential
election
Some
Democrats
realized
too
late
that
the
party
was
heading
over
a
cliff
at
this
point
but
did
nothing
substantive
to
stop
Senator
Barbara
Boxer
from
pursuing
the
challenge
And
now
the
inauguration
A
proud
tradition
of
over
200
years
has
now
been
reduced
to
yet
another
opportunity
for
the
Democrats
to
throw
venom
at
the
president
of
the
United
States
There's
nothing
wrong
with
protesting
the
inauguration
but
this
attempt
to
turn
the
cost
into
some
sort
of
national
scandal
while
ignoring
real
scandals
is
an
outrage
The
media's
complicity
in
this
shows
they
too
have
learned
nothing
from
recent
history
Republicans
have
finally
gotten
smart
and
are
for
the
most
part
saying
nothing
while
the
Democrats
flail
against
the
president
They've
finally
taken
to
heart
an
old
political
maxim
never
interrupt
your
enemy
while
he's
in
the
process
of
destroying
himself
The
Democrats
are
losing
the
middle
in
their
attempts
to
keep
the
fringe
And
they'll
suffer
for
it
again
in
2006
Sit
back

a
cold
drink
and

the
show
It's
going

Ban
Prayer
I
guess
Michael
Newdow
had
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
the
Supreme
Court
dismissed
his
under
God
lawsuit
on
a
technicality
The
attention-seeking
atheist
is
now
trying
to
ban
prayer
at

inauguration
next
Thursday
Newdow
claims
predictably
that
it
violates
the
separation

chur...oh
you
know
the
rest
of
the
argument
already
It's
practically
a
cliche
at
this
point
What's
next
for
Mr
Newdow
Will
he
now
seek
to
ban
saying
grace
at
government-run
cafeterias
How
about
closing
down
all
chapels
on
military
bases
I
know
how
about
taking
a
sandblaster
to
the
Lincoln
Memorial
There's
some
pretty
offensive
language
etched
into
the
walls
There's
quotes
from
the
Gettysburg
Address
It
is
rather
for
us
to
be
here
dedicated
to
the
great
task
remaining
before
us
that
from
these
honored
dead
we
take
increased
devotion
to
that
cause
for
which
they
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
that
we
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
vain
that
this
nation
under
God
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedom
and
that
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth.On
the
other
wall
there's
some
strong
stuff
from
the
second
inaugural
address
It
may
seem
strange
that
any
men
should
dare
to
ask
a
just
God's
assistance
in
wringing
their
bread
from
the
sweat
of
other
men's
faces
but
let
us
judge
not
that
we
be
not
judged
The
prayers
of
both
could
not
be
answered
That
of
neither
has
been
answered
fully
The
Almighty
has
His
own
purposes
Woe
unto
the
world
because
of
offenses
for
it
must
needs
be
that
offenses
come
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offense
cometh
If
we
shall
suppose
that
American
slavery
is
one
of
those
offenses
which
in
the
providence
of
God
must
needs
come
but
which
having
continued
through
His
appointed
time
He
now
wills
to
remove
and
that
He
gives
to
both
North
and
South
this
terrible
war
as
the
woe
due
to
those
by
whom
the
offense
came
shall
we
discern
therein
any
departure
from
those
divine
attributes
which
the
believers
in
a
living
God
always
ascribe
to
Him
Fondly
do
we
hope
fervently
do
we
pray
that
this
mighty
scourge
of
war
may
speedily
pass
away
Yet
if
God
wills
that
it
continue
until
all
the
wealth
piled
by
the
bondsman's
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
unrequited
toil
shall
be
sunk
and
until
every
drop
of
blood
drawn
with
the
lash
shall
be
paid
by
another
drawn
with
the
sword
as
was
said
three
thousand
years
ago
so
still
it
must
be
said
the
judgments
of
the
Lord
are
true
and
righteous
altogether."Look
I
know
the
election
season
was
bitter
and
there
are
a
lot
of
blue
state
Americans
who
are
really
angry
at
evangelicals
for
actually
voting
but
maybe
it's
time
for
liberals
and
the
Democrats
to
take
the
advice
Lincoln
gives
in
the
next
paragraph
of
that
great
speech
With
malice
toward
none
with
charity
for
all
with
firmness
in
the
right
as
God
gives
us
to
see
the
right
let
us
strive
on
to
finish
the
work
we
are
in
to
bind
up
the
nation's
wounds
to
care
for
him
who
shall
have
borne
the
battle
and
for
his
widow
and

orphan
to
do
all
which
may
achieve
and
cherish
a
just
and
lasting
peace
among
ourselves
and

telling

you're
a

Some
people
unfamiliar

look
at

as

you've
admitted
to
some

of
strange

Others
who

appalled
When
I
told
a

co-worker
that
I
was

you
would
have
thought
I'd
said
kicking
puppies
was

Which
it
can
be
depending
on
the

The
most
fun
is
telling
someone
at
my
church
that
I
blog
That
always
leads
to
a
few
moments
of
mental
anguish
and
wondering
whether
I'd
slipped
and
used
any
curse
words
while
discussing
Andrew
Sullivan
or
Keith
Olbermann's
latest
nonsense
I
guess
knowing
the

reads
the

keeps
me
honest
The

I
tried
with

Bitter
Bitter
The
New
York
Times
has
to
be
seriously
rethinking
their
relationship
with
columnist
Maureen
Dowd
If
not
they
really
should
Her
columns
are
usually
pretty
bad
but
today's
is
especially
pathetic
In
it
she
unleashes
an
angry
broadside
against
men
Not
just
some
men
but
all
of
us
The
name
of
the
column
Men
Just
Want
Mommy
You
can
only
imagine
the
content
I'd
been
noticing
a
trend
along
these
lines
as
famous
and
powerful
men
took
up
with
the
young
women
whose
job
it
was
to
tend
to
them
and
care
for
them
in
some
way
their
secretaries
assistants
nannies
caterers
flight
attendants
researchers
and
fact-checkers
Women
in
staff
support
are
the
new
sirens
because
as
a
guy
I
know
put
it
they
look
upon
the
men
they
work
for
as
the
moon
the
sun
and
the
stars
It's
all
about
orbiting
serving
and
salaaming
their
Sun
Gods
A
new
study
by
psychology
researchers
at
the
University
of
Michigan
using
college
undergraduates
suggests
that
men
going
for
long-term
relationships
would
rather
marry
women
in
subordinate
jobs
than
women
who
are
supervisors
As
Dr
Stephanie
Brown
the
lead
author
of
the
study
summed
it
up
for
reporters
Powerful
women
are
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
marriage
market
because
men
may
prefer
to
marry
less-accomplished
women
Men
think
that
women
with
important
jobs
are
more
likely
to
cheat
on
them.Wow
For
the
record
Dowd
isn't
married
and
judging
by
the
content
of
this
column
isn't
likely
to
get
married
anytime
soon
Allow
me
to
defend
men
Most
of
my
contemporaries
are
married
to
strong
smart
women
I
happen
to
be
married
to
one
myself
Most
of
us
if
asked
would
admit
our
wives
are
smarter
than
us
I
don't
want
to
marry
a
subordinate
woman
nor
do
any
of
my
friends
At
least
two
guys
I
know
have
wives
who
make
more
money
than
they
do
I'm
in
the
same
situation
In
fact
I
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
most
men
when
asked
will
admit
they
married
up
in
life
Dowd's
column
is
unconvincing
to
say
the
least
That
she
uses
Hollywood
movies
and
the
testimonies
of
women
who
share
her
bitterness
to
illustrate
her
point
shows
the
weakness
of
her
thesis
Maybe
the
men
that
Dowd
comes
in
contact
with
are
power-mad
egoists
Or
maybe
the
men
Dowd
has
dated
sense
her
underlying
bitterness
toward
them
and
men
in
general
Either
way
I
feel
sorry
for
Dowd
who
seems
to
be
a
pretty
angry
person

Sullivan
Keeps
Digging
For
a
few
minutes
the
guy
started
to
make
sense
then
he
just
couldn't
help
himself
I
decided
to
check
Andrew
Sullivan's
site
today
to
see
if
he
had
clarified
his
earlier
statement
about
the
president
and
faith
He
did
sort
of
But
first
he
has
to
continue
digging
the
hole
he
started
months
ago
BUSH
AND
THE
LORD
Did
I
over-react
It's
worth
looking
at
the
full
quote
as
produced
by
the
Washington
Times
I
fully
understand
that
the
job
of
the
president
is
and
must
always
be
protecting
the
great
right
of
people
to
worship
or
not
worship
as
they
see
fit
That's
what
distinguishes
us
from
the
Taliban
The
greatest
freedom
we
have
or
one
of
the
greatest
freedoms
is
the
right
to
worship
the
way
you
see
fit
On
the
other
hand
I
don't
see
how
you
can
be
president
at
least
from
my
perspective
how
you
can
be
president
without
a
relationship
with
the
Lord
My
italics
Now
notice
that
Bush
is
explicitly
qualifying
his
defense
of
religious
freedom
or
the
freedom
to
have
no
religion
at
all
by
saying
that
the
presidency
in
his
view
should
nevertheless
be
reserved
for
people
with
a
relationship
of
a
personal
nature
with
the
Lord."Nonsense
He's
saying
I
don't
see
how
you
can
be
president
without
a
relationship
with
the
Lord
Like
many
many
other
presidents
FDR
Lincoln
Bush
is
simply
acknowledging
that
this
is
a
difficult
job
and
hard
to
do
without
a
relationship
with
God
There's
nothing
NOTHING
here
about
reserving
the
office
for
religious
people
He
isn't
simply
saying
that
he
doesn't
see
how
he
could
have
endured
the
presidency
without
faith
he
is
asserting
that
he
cannot
see
how
anyone
could
be
president
without
a
relationship
with
the
Lord
Now
I
can
see
how
this
might
be
simply
a
slip
of
the
tongue
just
a
projection
of
his
own
experience
with
nothing
more
to
be
inferred
from
it.Where
does
Sullivan
see
that
assertion
The
man
is
not
putting
a
litmus
test
on
the
presidency
he's
simply
giving
his
own
perspective
on
faith
and
the
presidency
Only
someone
with
an
extreme
hostility
to
any
religious
talk
by
public
officials
could
misread
the
president's
statement
In
the
next
few
sentences
Sullivan
proves
he's
that
type
of
person
But
given
how
this
administration
has
consciously
eroded
the
distinction
between
church
and
state
fusing
the
two
with
federal
funds
using
religious
groups
as
its
political
base
incorporating
religious
leaders
into
policy-making
and
defending
public
policy
decisions
on
purely
religious
grounds
calling
civil
marriage
licenses
sacred
for
example
this
is
worrying
To
put
it
bluntly
on
the
separation
of
church
and
state
I
don't
trust
these
guys.Sullivan
is
treading
onto
some
seriously
dangerous
territory
here
Look
at
what
he
gives
as
evidence
for
eroding
the
distinction
between
church
and
state
fusing
the
two
with
federal
funds
okay
this
one
is
debatable
But
the
funds
prohibit
explicit
proselytizing
by
those
groups
and
Bush's
policy
actually
ends
the
government-sponsored
discrimination
against
people
of
faith
That
having
been
said
I'm
not
a
big
supporter
of
churches
taking
federal
funds
using
religious
groups
as
its
political
base
So
what
Religious
people
have
the
right
to
vote
and
get
politically
involved
and
speak
out
just
like
anyone
else
If
Bush
chose
to
court
these
voters
with
particular
focus
this
season
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that
Is
Sullivan
suggesting
that
religious
faith
removes
my
right
to
participate
in
the
free
exchange
of
ideas
or
to
associate
with
others
who
may
be
of
my
same
faith
and
advocate
for
particular
policies
Has
his
hatred
grown
so
strong
that
he's
willing
to
advocate
the
removal
of
religious
people
from
the
public
square
With
his
next
objection
to
Bush
Sullivan
answers
these
questions
incorporating
religious
leaders
into
policy-making
So
in
Sullivan's
view
religious
leaders
should
sit
down
shut
up
and
take
what
the
government
gives
them
Let's
play
change
the
words
shall
we
Incorporating
African-American
leaders
into
policy-making
Incorporating
gay
and
lesbian
leaders
into
policy-making
Incorporating
Hispanic
leaders
into
policy-making
Wow
say
it
any
other
way
and
it
sounds
the
same
like
simple
bigotry
defending
public
policy
decisions
on
purely
religious
grounds
calling
civil
marriage
licenses
sacred
for
example
I'm
actually
partially
with
Sullivan
on
this
one
I
don't
think
purely
religious
arguments
are
a
compelling
enough
reason
to
make
public
policy
decisions
However
I
don't
think
the
arguments
from
religious
people
should
be
entirely
discounted
either
That's
where
he
and
I
disagree
Sullivan
ends
his
rant
by
saying
he
doesn't
trust
the
Bush
administration
That's
great
but
at
least
they're
honest
about
what
they
believe
and
don't
try
to
hide
behind
tolerant
words
while
espousing
gob-smackingly
vile
anti-religious
rhetoric

Mandatory
Belts
Seat
belts
are
a
good
idea
Anyone
who
doesn't
wear
them
is
a
ninny
especially
when
driving
in
Maine
during
the
winter
months
Okay
enough
disclaimers
The
governor's
seat
belt
initiative
is
a
feel-good
measure
impossible
to
enforce
that
will
do
nothing
to
prevent
healthcare
costs
from
rising
From
today's
Bangor
Daily
News
Uninsured
Mainers
who
elect
to
drive
without
using
their
seat
belts
are
racking
up
enormous
hospital
bills
in
the
aftermath
of
automobile
accidents
and
ratcheting
up
the
cost
of
health
care
for
everyone
else
in
the
state
To
illustrate
the
point
at
a
Wednesday
morning
news
conference
Dr
Erik
Steele
chief
medical
officer
of
Eastern
Maine
Healthcare
Systems
walked
to
the
end
of
the
massive
conference
table
in
the
governor's
cabinet
room
and
unfurled
the
hospital
bill
from
a
single
patient
It
was
12
feet
long
This
is
the
hospital
bill
from
a
Maine
Medicaid
patient
it's
78,000
from
an
unbelted
patient
who
was
injured
in
a
crash
in
Maine
and
taxpayers
paid
for
this
patient
Steele
said
I
have
several
of
these
bills...These
tremendous
costs
can
be
prevented
and
must
be
prevented
if
we're
really
to
get
a
handle
on
health
care
costs
in
this
state."Governor
Baldacci
wants
to
make
the
failure
to
use
a
seat
belt
a
primary
offense
rather
than
secondary
This
means
in
Maine
police
will
be
free
to
pull
you
over
for
not
having
a
seat
belt
on
in
your
car
And
just
how
on
earth
will
they
ensure
that
we're
all
wearing
our
seat
belts
And
how
much
will
that
increased
enforcement
cost
in
terms
of
manhours
in
the
police
department
and
court
system
Will
it
outweigh
the
losses
we're
already
taking
in
healthcare
costs
Then
there's
the
other
issue
the
hospital
is
not
completely
blameless
in
this
situation
Why
was
the
bill
12
pages
long
What
was
done
to
this
patient
that
required
12
pages
worth
of
medical
treatment
A
few
months
ago
I
had
chest
pains
and
went
to
the
ER
I'm
only
32
so
I
figured
it
was
probably
nothing
but
chest
pains
are
chest
pains
I
got
right
in
had
an
EKG
a
chest
X-ray
and
some
blood
work
Turned
out
to
be
nothing
I
was
at
the
hospital
for
maybe
three
hours
Cost
me
nearly
600
and
I
got
three
separate
bills
one
for
the
bloodwork
one
from
the
hospital
and
one
for
the
X-ray
My
insurance
covered
most
of
it
but
the
cost
was
still
high
Now
X-rays
were
discovered
in
1895
This
is
not
new
technology
So
why
does
it
still
cost
so
much
to
get
one
The
answer
is
artificial
price
controls
Steele
answered
his
own
question
during
his
presentation
the
patient
had
Medicare
which
sets
a
certain
cost
on
procedures
through
its
reimbursement
rates
If
the
market
were
setting
costs
and
not
Medicare
and
insurance
companies
health
care
would
cost
what
the
average
customer
could
afford
However
most
of
us
use
insurance
which
helps
set
the
cost
at
artificially
high
rates
Two
dollar
aspirins
and
such
are
the
result
of
separating
the
consumer
from
the
cost
of
the
service
Governor
Baldacci
just
added
to
the
problem
by
adding
another
price
control
system
into
the
mix
Dirigo
Health
is
a
boondoggle
that
will
put
another
reimbursement
schedule
into
the
cost
of
health
care
all
at
the
taxpayer's
expense
And
isn't
it
just
convenient
that
the
governor
after
proposing
this
expensive
health
care
system
gives
police
a
whole
new
reason
to
collect
revenue
from
drivers
I'm
not
the
conspiracy
theory
type
but
it's
an
interesting
question
Like
most
governments
Baldacci
is
attacking
the
easiest
problem
rather
than
face
the
facts
that
it's
a
flawed
Medicare
system
and
a
flawed
health
care
cost
structure
that
have
led
to
the
current
issue
Forcing
people
to
wear
seat
belts
and
ticketing
them
for
the
infraction
may
help
prevent
some
injuries
and
raise
some
revenue
for
the
state
but
it
won't
even
begin
to
touch
the
problem
of
inflated
health
care
costs
and
the
governor
should
stop
pretending
it
does

Criminy
Andrew
Sullivan

really
gotten
tiring
Saw
this
tidbit
on
The
Corner
ATHEISTS
NEED
NOT
APPLY
What
was

thinking
with
this
statement
President
Bush
said
yesterday
that
he
doesn't
see
how
you
can
be

without
a
relationship
with
the
Lord
but
that
he
is
always
mindful
to
protect
the
right
of
others
to
worship
or
not
worship
So
out
of
his
beneficence
he
won't
trample
on
others
religious
freedom
But
the
White
House
That's
for
Christians
only
No
Jews
Or
atheists
Notice
also
the
evangelical
notion
of
a
personal
relationship
with
the
Lord
That
also
indicates
suspicion
of
those
Christians
with
different
approaches
to
the
divine
I
must
say
this
is
a
new
level
of
religio-political
fusion
in
this
administration
To
restrict
the
presidency
to
a
particular
religious
faith
is
anathema
to
this
country's
traditions
and
to
the
task
of
toleration
The
president
surely
needs
to
retract
the
statement.And
Andrew

ATHEISTS

was
he
thinking
Oh
I
don't
know
Maybe
he
was
thinking
a
relationship
with
God
makes
the
presidency
easier
That's
how
I
read
this
Bush
is
simply
asking
a
rhetorical
question
Only
someone
with
an
extreme
dislike
of
the
president
combined
with
some
serious
hypersensitivity
toward
conservative
Christians
could
take
offense
to
this
or
read
it
and
project
this
meaning
onto
what
Bush
is
saying
So
out
of
his
beneficence
he
won't
trample
on
others
religious
freedom
But
the
White
House
That's
for
Christians
only
No
Jews
Or
atheists?[sarcasm]No
Andrew
No
Jews
no
atheists
The
cabal
has
taken
power
and
we're
not
giving
it
up
that
easily.[/sarcasm
Sullivan
is
really
out
of
control
here
After
giving
Bush's
quote
the
worst
possible
characterization
he
then
takes
the
lunacy
a
step
further
and
suggests
Bush
is
a
bigot
Nice
Notice
also
the
evangelical
notion
of
a
personal
relationship
with
the
Lord
That
also
indicates
suspicion
of
those
Christians
with
different
approaches
to
the
divine.Yes
evangelicals
have
this
notion
of
a
personal
relationship
with
the
Lord
This
doesn't
necessarily
mean
I
have
a
suspicion
of
Christians
who
have
different
approaches
to
the
divine
Sullivan
is
once
again
letting
his
personal
prejudice
against
the
evangelicals
who
got
Bush
elected
show
We
aren't
just
gay-bashing
neanderthals
We
actually
believe
we
have
personal
relationships
with
God
Man
we
Christians
are
sickos
aren't
we
I
must
say
this
is
a
new
level
of
religio-political
fusion
in
this
administration
To
restrict
the
presidency
to
a
particular
religious
faith
is
anathema
to
this
country's
traditions
and
to
the
task
of
toleration.Actually
this
country's
traditions
are
based
in
a
religio-political
fusion
Many
of
those
who
founded
this
country
believed
strongly
in
God
but
also
in
tolerance
Bush
never
suggested
restricting
the
presidency
It's
Sullivan's
fevered
newly
Bush-hating
imagination
that's
given
the
president's
words
that
particular
shade
of
evil
The
president
surely
needs
to
retract
the
statement.And
Andrew
needs
to
calm
down
and
stop
looking
at
the
president
and
his
words
through
the
emotional
filter
he's
been
using
since
Bush
announced
his
support
for
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
Sullivan's
anger
toward
Bush
and
evangelicals
has
turned
him
from
a
reasonable
voice
of
center-right
thought
into
a
thoroughly
unpleasant
person
Posts
like
these
are
why
I
stopped
reading
Sullivan
I
simply
cannot
stand
bigots
Especially
those
who
mask
their
prejudice
behind
constant
demands
of
tolerance
from
others

Bloggermann
Returns
Keith
Olbermann
finally
returns
to
the
keyboard
to
tackle
a
journalistic
scandal
Nope
not
that
one
Olbermann
is
fired
up
about
Armstrong
Williams
the
commentator
paid
by
the
Department
of
Education
to
promote
the
No
Child
Left
Behind
Act
Olbermann
mentions
the
documents
scandal
only
to
say
that
it
in
no
way
overshadows
the
pernicious
evil
and
yes
unprecedented
behavior
of
Williams
and
the
Bush
administration
Blog-boy
is
obviously
pretty
ticked
that
he
wasn't
offered
a
quarter-mil
from
anyone
In
discussing
the
Williams
fiasco
Olbermann
throws
in
this
little
gem
Then
there
is
Sinclair
Broadcast
Group
The
39-station
conglomerate
still
infamous
over
its
transformation
of
some
Swift
Boat
Veterans
malarkey
into
news"...Jeez
what
a
jerk
and
yet
what
proof
of
just
how
badly
the
Swift
Vets
hurt
liberals
Olbermann
just
cannot
resist
throwing
out
the
insult
Of
course
he's
never
actually
shown
a
desire
to
actually
report
news
so
I
guess
it's
no
shocker
that
he
doesn't
recognize
it
when
it
comes
along
Olbermann
then
continues
trying
to
whip
the
Williams
story
into
a
bona
fide
scandal
that
he
can
blog
about
now
that
the
election
has
been
certified
and
his
conspiracy
theory
moonbat
brigade
have
all
gone
back
to
the
DU
discussion
boards
In
full
Joe
McCarthy
mode
Olbermann
says
there
are
others
who
have
received
funds
from
the
government
to
promote
programs
and
looks
forward
to
a
congressional
investigation
Then
obviously
feeling
as
though
he's
not
far
enough
into
the
fever
swamps
Olbermann
offers
another
pearl
of
wisdom
But
the
Williams
revelations
do
remind
me
that
I've
always
wondered
how
some
of
the
monolithic
elaborate
websites
especially
conservative
ones
with
a
million
links
have
managed
to
stay
afloat
financially
and
if
somebody
in
government
wasn't
supplying
them
with
more
than
just
hot
news
flashes.Yup
All
of
us
conservative
bloggers
are
nothing
more
than
hogs
at
the
big
government
money
trough
Especially
the
big
ones
How
about
this
for
a
reason
Conservative
bloggers
don't
make
all
that
much
money
from
the
blogs
and
don't
depend
on
them
as
a
sole
source
of
income
most
actually
have
these
things
called
jobs
The
blog
thing
is
just
a
hobby
Olbermann
concludes
his
little
hate-fest
by
attacking
Bill
O'Reilly
Now
I
find
O'Reilly
a
bit
annoying
He
was
once
great
but
is
growing
a
bit
too
egoistic
to
watch
Still
though
is
this
really
necessary
The
man
who
moved
from
falafels
loofahs
and
60,000,000
dollar
lawsuits
over
sexual
harassment
charges
to
becoming
the
self-appointed
holy
protector
of
Christmas
has
now
taken
off
on
another
flight
of
delusion
of
grandeur
He's
attacked
Saturday's
tsunami
relief
telethon
on
NBC
and
its
owned
cable
networks
like
MSNBC
The
other
night
O'Reilly
told
his
semi-comatose
viewers
A
national
TV
telethon
will
raise
millions
and
The
Factor
will
be
watching
to
see
if
the
money
gets
to
the
tsunami
victims
If
it
does
not
there
will
be
trouble."First
of
all
puck-brain
get
thee
to
a
copy
of
The
Elements
of

Trust
me
Second
I
don't
think
the
consciousness
or
lack
therof
of
his
viewers
is
what's
really
bothering
Blog-Boy
I
think
it's
that
no
matter
what
state
O'Reilly's
viewers
are
in
the
fact
is
that
there
are
a
lot
more
of
them
I
give
the

six
more
months
Maybe
Without

though
I
wonder
who
Olbermann
is
going
to

for
this

Gov

Washington's

Christine
Gregoire
will

sworn
in

Personally
I
agree
with
the
Wall

a

I
think
Gregoire
will
keep

an

ineffective

Nearly
60
percent

The

won

have
no

what's

waiting
for

It
will
likely
be
a
long
time
before
any

wins

office
in
Ohio
for
instance
Look
at
Florida
in

won

may
not

Armstrong

Just
realized
that
I
forgot
to
blog
about
Armstrong
Williams
and
his
big
payday
from
the
Department

Education
My
thoughts
on
the
controversy
can
be
summed
up
rather
quickly
what
the
DoE
and
Williams
did
was
stupid
Do
I
make
any
money
from
the

A
miniscule
amount
from
Google
Ads
but
I
haven't
seen
any
of
that
yet
The
main
reason
I'm
getting
involved
with
them
is
that
I
think
there's
real
revenue
potential
in
the
future
and
thought
getting
in
on
the
ground
floor
was
important
It's
more
of
a
business
move
than
any
serious
attempt
to
make
the
blog
pay
The
blog
helped
me
get
a
column
but
that
job
is
more
the
result
of
knowing
someone
than
being
discovered
It
just
made
giving
a
writing
sample
very
simple
If

promote
ideas
they
should
disclose

Inevitable
Accepted
The

President
Bush's
Ohio
victory
have
finally
dropped
the
case
Three
dozen
voters
challenging
the
presidential
election
results
in
the
Ohio
Supreme
Court
asked
to
drop
their
lawsuit
Tuesday
saying
it
is
moot
with
last
week's
certification
of
the
electoral
vote
and
the
upcoming
inauguration.Yeah
the
guy
you
hate
getting
inaugurated
kind
of
puts
a
damper
on
the
whole
overturning
a
legitimate
election
through
whining
thing
Without
giving
specifics
attorney
Cliff
Arnebeck
said
challenges
of
the
results
would
continue
in
state
or
federal
courts
But
he
conceded
that
there
was
nothing
available
now
to
try
to
prevent
Bush's
inauguration
We
are
not
quitting
We
are
going
on

we

Yeah

I
love
the
quote
We're
going

I
mean
really
How
pathetic
is
that
It's
an
amazing
admission
of
unrepentant
obsessiveness
The
Rev
Jesse
Jackson
backed
the
lawsuit
alleging
what
he
called
high-tech
vote
stealing
and
holding
rallies
in
Ohio
and
Washington
in
support
of
the
effort.How
far
Jesse
has
fallen
From
Selma

Sandusky
Hugh
Hewitt
was
right
If
the
vote
had
been
any
closer
these
people
would
have
tried
to
steal
the
election
The
118,000
vote
margin
in
Ohio
and
the
300,000
vote
margin
in
Florida
threw
cold
water
on
those
plans

something

Mapes
self-serving

disingenuous
statement
After
reading
the

and
the
statements
made
by

president
Les
Moonves
it's
obvious
they
hoped
to
somehow
portray
Mapes
as
a
terrible
journalist
which
she
made
easier
by
actually
being
one
but
someone
who
was
not
motivated
by
political
biases
Mapes
is
the
fall
guy
for
this
whole
scandal
but
the
report
provides
no
motive
for
her
actions
other
than
the
need
to
put
a
good
story
on
the
air
too
quickly
Nothing
is
said
about
her
habit
of
checking
extreme
Bush-hating

her
obsession
with
the
AWOL
story
and
her
quoting
of

Instapundit
links
to
a
story
that
says
the
Sandy
Berger
investigation
is
still
active
Interesting
tidbit
The
documents
include
multiple
drafts
of
a
review
of
the
2000
millennium
threat
said
to
conclude
that
only
luck
prevented
a
2000
attack
That
story
conflicts
with
Berger's
own
testimony
to
the
commission
in
which
he
claimed
that
we
thwarted
millennium
attacks
by
being
vigilant
rather
than
by
sheer
luck
as
the
review
reportedly
suggests.Looks
like
the
Clintons
are
still
in
full
legacy-protection
mode
and
still
getting
minions
to
do
their
dirty
work
and
pay
the
legal
price
So
now
we
know
that
the
9/11
Commission
contained
a
person
who
created
the
very
laws
the
panel
investigated
was
lied
to
by
witnesses
and
was
presented
incomplete
documents
on
the
previous
administration's
response
to
terrorism
I'd
say
this
makes
their
work
and
conclusions
somewhat
suspect

the
campaign
They
put
their
reputations
on
the
line
to
tell
the
truth
about
John
Kerry
and
were
savaged
by
the
media
Any
time
the
MSM
mentions
their
ad
campaign
they
always
add
the
disclaimer
debunked
Even
now
after
Kerry
has
lost
the
election
the
MSM
cannot
bring
themselves
to
admit
the
Swift
Vets
may
have
been
right
and
Kerry's
war
hero
stories
are
exaggerated
Today
Power
Line
says
and
I
agree
that
one
of
the
main
reasons
CBS
pursued
the
Bush
AWOL
story
with
such
vigor
is
that
the
Swift
Vets
stripped
the
momentum
from
the
Kerry
campaign
The
documents
came
along
at
just
the
right
time
which
should
have
been
Mapes
first
clue
that
something
was
wrong
But
she
was
so
blinded
by
a
political
agenda
she
didn't
see
the
obvious
That's
what
the
report
whitewashed
and
that's
what
CBS
should
be
pressed
to
admit
And
if
they
won't
admit
that
then
maybe
they
should
just
fire
Heyward
That'll
work
too

Paul

posts

that

Heyward
Must
Go
I've
finished
much
of
the
report
and
it
seems
obvious
to
me
that
CBS
News
president
Andrew
Heyward
should
be
fired
The
report
is
extremely
critical
of
the
response
of
CBS
News
after
it
became
apparent
the
documents
were
forged
and
the
story
was
collapsing
One
of
the
major
architects
of
the
stonewalling
was
Heyward
who
has
kept
his
job
The
report
makes
it
clear
the
story
had
collapsed
by
September
10
or
so
Despite
the
overwhelming
evidence
to
the
contrary
Heyward
and
CBS
News
engaged
in
a
misleading
defense
of
the
story
and
the
documents
used
to
prove
Bush
was
AWOL
from
his
guard
service
Although
most
of
the
blame
was
rightly
placed
on
Mapes
and
other
executives
Heyward
has
to
answer
for
his
role
in
the
lies
used
to
defend
a
bad
story
At
any
time
Heyward
could
have
pulled
Mapes
and
Rather
off
the
story
and
given
it
to
someone
else
to
investigate
Heyward
could
have
ordered
an
investigation
of
the
sources
and
at
minimum
acknowledged
the
questions
surrounding
the
story
on
the
news
Instead
Heyward
either
took
part
in
or
allowed
the
insipid
and
misleading
defense
of
the
story
on
the
CBS
Evening
News
Either
way
his
judgment
was
poor
and
his
management
was
sloppy
Neither
reflects
well
on
his
leadership
and
viewers
of
CBS
News
have
reason
to
be
suspicious
of
any
future
scoops
that
come
out
of
that
network
as
long
as
Heyward
is
in
charge
The
four
firings
announced

were
only
a

The
Political
Agenda
section
is
disappointing
The
Panel
is
aware
that
some
have
ascribed
political
motivations
to
60
Minutes
Wednesday's
decision
to
air
the
September
8
Segment
just
two
months
before
the
presidential
election
while
others
further
found
political
bias
in
the
program
itself
The
Panel
reviewed
this
issue
and
found
certain
actions
that
could
support
such
charges
However
the
Panel
cannot
conclude
that
a
political
agenda
at
60
Minutes
Wednesday
drove
either
the
timing
of
the
airing
of
the
Segment
or
its
content.Right
This
comes
just
after
a
lengthy
discussion
of
how
Mary
Mapes
talked
to
members
of
the
Kerry
campaign
about
the
story
And
the
report
makes
no
mention
of

coincidentally
timed
Fortunate

campaign
that
the

ran
just
after

Believer
to
the
End
The
Rather
report
reserves
most
of
its
harsh
language
for
Mary
Mapes
who
is
a
somewhat
pathetic
figure
by
the
middle
of
the
report
Even
after
the
documents
had
been
torn
apart
by
document
experts
on
the
internet
Mapes
tried
to
convince
the
investigators
of
their
authenticity
The
Panel
was
not
able
to
reach
a
definitive
conclusion
as
to
the
authenticity
of
the
Killian
documents
However
Mapes
made
oral
and
written
presentations
to
the
Panel
during
its
investigation
in
an
effort
to
demonstrate
that
the
content
of
the
Killian
documents
was
in
fact
authentic
These
presentations
were
done
primarily
by
comparing
the
Killian
documents
with
official
Bush
records
to
show
how
well
she
believed
that
the
Killian

meshed

Wow
One
thing
has
become
apparent
from
my
reading
of
the
Rather
report
Mary
Mapes
is
an
extremely
bad
reporter/producer
The
Panel
has
several
concerns
about
whether
the
airing
of
the
Barnes
interview
excerpts
constituted
fair
and
accurate
reporting
by
60
Minutes
Wednesday
For
example
the
excerpts
pertaining
to
Barnes
conveyed
the
unmistakable
impression
that
President
Bush
gained
entry
into
the
TexANG
through
preferential
treatment
Barnes
stated
however
that
he
did
not
know
if
his
call
to
a
TexANG
official
back
in
1968
made
any
difference
with
respect
to
President
Bush
Further
Mapes
had
been
told
previously
by
several
former
TexANG
officers
that
President
Bush
entered
the
TexANG
without
any
preferential
treatment
Finally
Mapes
confirmed
to
the
Panel
that
there
was
conflicting
information
about
whether
there
even
was
a
waiting
list
to
get
in
the
TexANG
as
of
the
spring
of
1968
At
a
minimum
these
issues
should
have
been
disclosed
to
the
60
Minutes
Wednesday
management
but
they
were
not.Gee
I
wonder
what
could
have
blinded
Mapes
to
any
other
interpretation
of
the
evidence
It
also
makes
me
wonder
whether
CBS
like
the
NY
Times
with
Jayson
Blair
should
go
back

re-examine

The
report
on
the
use
of
fraudulent
documents
by

has
finally
been
released
months

Mary

The
producer
of
the
piece
Mary
Mapes
was
terminated.I
guess
the
interviews
with
Mapes
didn't
go
well
The
story
was
broadcast
last
fall
she's
been
there
at
least
three
months
too
long
in
my
opinion
Here
is
their
statement
on
the
memos
from
the
executive
summary
The
Panel
has
not
been
able
to
conclude
with
absolute
certainty
whether
the
Killian
documents
are
authentic
or
forgeries
However
the
Panel
has
identified
a
number
of
issues
that
raise
serious
questions
about
the
authenticity
of
the
documents
and
their
content
With
better
reporting
these
questions
should
have
been
raised
before
the
September
8
Segment
aired.The
panel
had
harsh
words
for
CBS
reaction
to
the
controversy
over
the
authenticity
of
the
memos
the
investigation
quickly
identified
considerable
and
fundamental
deficiencies
relating
to
the
reporting
and
production
of
the
September
8
Segment
and
the
statements
and
news
reports
during
the
Aftermath
These
problems
were
caused
primarily
by
a
myopic
zeal
to
be
the
first
news
organization
to
broadcast
what
was
believed
to
be
a
new
story
about
President
Bush's
TexANG
service
and
the
rigid
and
blind
defense
of
the
Segment
after
it
aired
despite
numerous
indications
of
its
shortcomings.I
think
blaming
myopic
zeal
is
too
easy
There
should
have
been
some
mention
of
bias
since
it
was
so
obviously
a
factor

The
little
fracas
in
the

yesterday
obviously
didn't
poll
well
Today
on
Fox

Senator
Chuck

said
that
it

of
Boxer
to
try
and
bring
up
election
issues
but
wrong
of
her
to
stop
the
counting
of
the
electoral
votes
He
was
quite
adamant
on
the
point
and
taking
pains
to
separate
himself
from
Boxer's
actions
yesterday
Boxer
did
what
she
thought
was
right
based
on
Michael
Moore's
movie
Fahrenheit
9/11
and
the
complaints
of
the
far
left
and
it
led
the
Democrats
into
another
tar
patch
If
the
Republicans
are
smart
they'll
remind
voters
of
that
party's
attempts
to
disenfranchise
Ohio's
voters
over
and
over
again
Yesterday
the
Democrats
showed
just
how
much
they
learned
from

election

The
Boxer
Rebellion
In
1954
Senator
Joseph
McCarthy
was
censured
by
the
United
States
Senate
It
was
alleged
that
McCarthy
acted
contrary
to
senatorial
ethics
and
tended
to
bring
the
Senate
into
dishonor
and
disrepute
to
obstruct
the
constitutional
processes
of
the
Senate
and
to
impair
its
dignity
and
such
conduct
is
hereby
condemned
At
issue
was
McCarthy's
use
of
his
subcommittee
to
bring
charges
against
citizens
accusing
them
of
being
Communists
or
in
league
with
Communists
Yesterday
Senator
Barbara
Boxer
at
the
urging
of
people
like
MoveOn
and
Michael
Moore
stopped
the
constitutional
process
to
air
false
charges
against
the
Republican
party
and
the
president's
re-election
campaign
The
speeches
made
in
defense
of
the
obstruction
consisted
mostly
of
outrage
and
conjecture
There
was
no
sound
reason
to
stop
the
Senate
from
carrying
out
its
constitutionally-mandated
duty
to
certify
the
electoral
college
vote
The
Senate
was
certainly
stripped
of
its
dignity
yesterday
and
turned
into
a
forum
to
question
the
legitimacy
of
a
president
elected
with
286
electoral
votes
and
51
percent
of
the
popular
vote
The
Democrats
can
frame
the
issue
however
they
want
but
what
they
wanted
to
do
yesterday
was
disenfranchise
the
almost
6
million
people
who
voted
in
Ohio
by
throwing
out
the
results
in
that
state
This
despite
no
solid
evidence
of
voter
fraud
or
voting
irregularities
and
a
118,000
vote
victory
margin
by
the
president
Again
there
was
no
good
reason
to
call
into
question
the
legitimacy
of
a
president
on
the
floor
of
the
United
States
Congress
For
this
reason
Senator
Barbara
Boxer
should
be
censured
by
the
United
States
Senate
for
obstructing
the
constitutional
processes
of
the
Senate
bringing
dishonor
upon
that
body
and
impairing
its
dignity
I
hope
Republicans
have
the
courage
to
do
what
needs
to
be
done
to
this
member
of
Congress
who
for
partisan
purposes
has
tried
to
make
an
elected
president
illegitimate
through
innuendo
and
lies

Advice
from

Peggy
Noonan
has
some
good
advice
for
the
Democrats
Given
what's
going
to
happen
today
during

certification
I
have
a
candidate
for
a
Sister
Souljah

If
Sen
Barbara
Boxer
does
go
through
with
her
plans
it
weakens
Harry
Reid
already
It's
already
been
reported
that
he
tried
to
talk
her
out
of
it
and
was
upset
so
having
it
happen
will
show
he
lost
his
first
big
battle
against
a
senator
from
his
own
party
This
shows
just
how
damaging
the
defeat
of
Tom
Daschle
was
to
the
Democrats
If
he
were
still
minority
leader
Boxer
would
stay
silent
during
the
certification
It's
interesting
that
she's
choosing
to
buck
her
own

Never

Say
This
Al
Gore
has
more
class
than
John
Kerry
Even
though
Gore
helped
make
our
politics
more
bitter
by
contesting
the
Florida
vote
he
at
least
had
the
decency
to
keep
his
fellow
Democrats
from
raising
a
fuss
during
the
counting
of
the
electoral
vote
in

John
Kerry
sent
out
an
email
today
to
his
supporters
saying
that
while
he
would
not
contest
the
vote
he
plans
to
ensure
every
vote
is
counted
in

also

UPDATE
TKS
is
reporting
that
Boxer
isn't
completely
decided
on

challenge
yet
Harry
Reid
is
reportedly
counseling
against

Most
pundits
on

agree
to
challenge

given
Bush's
margin
of
victory
would
be
an
extremely
stupid
move
They're
partisan
but
there
are
some
good
thoughts
The
Democrats
have
to
start
thinking
about
the
future
instead
of
simply
obsessing
on
the
past
Indulging
themselves
now

please

the
repercussions
of
such
a

Must-Read
of
the
Day
Powerline
dissects
a
piece
in
Columbia
Journalism
Review
about
the
Rathergate
affair
The
article
is
more
of
an
apologia
for
Dan
Rather
and
CBS
than
any
sort
of
serious
attempt
to
understand
what
happened
after
60
Minutes
ran
a
story
about
Bush's
National
Guard
service
based
on
fraudulent
documents
Powerline
calls
this
the
journalism
in
decline
I
would
argue
the
profession
of
journalism
has
been
in
decline
much
longer
When
I
was
in
college
I
worked
at
the
student
newspaper
While
there
I
worked
with
people
who
are
now
journalists
for
local
and
regional
media
outlets
Presumably
they
will
move
up
in
their
chosen
profession
Most
of
them
are
good
journalists
but
a
few
are
ideologues
with
an
axe
to
grind
One
day
I
was
in
the
office
when
one
of
the
editors
was
looking
at
a
paid
insert
scheduled
to
go
into
the
next
day's
paper
It
was
a
pro-life
brochure
paid
for
by
a
local
right-to-life
committee
The
editor
said
to
me
you
know
if
I
could
I
would
pull
this
f***ing
thing
out
of
the
paper
and
refund
the
money
I
was
once
pressured
to
attend
a
community
meeting
that
turned
out
to
be
a
Democrat
fundraiser
I
refused
to
file
a
story
and
was
reprimanded
by
a
different
editor
When
I
became
an
editor
myself
and
began
writing
editorials
from
a
conservative
viewpoint
I
was
subjected
to
some
truly
enjoyable
for
me
hate
mail
and
some
angry
comments
from
co-workers
I'm
glad
the
blogosphere
exists
now
to
act
as
a
watchdog
on
the
media
having
seen
some
of
the

Kangaroo

Although

expect
Alberto
Gonzales
to
be
confirmed
as
Attorney
General
Senate
Democrats
still
plan
to
hold
a
torture
show
during
the
hearings
Senator
Patrick
Leahy
of
Vermont
said
in
a
statement
that
the
upcoming
hearings
are
a
chance
for
some
accountability
and
for
some
answers
that
have
been
lacking
from
the
administration
about
its
policies
on
torture
and
about
the
prison-abuse
scandals
So
expect
to
see
pictures
of
naked
Iraqis
piled
on
the
floor
stupid
soldiers
pointing
at
naked
men
and
the
other
images
we
saw
ad
nauseum
during
the
Abu
Gharib
scandal
Leahy
is
a
nasty
man
who
never
misses
an
opportunity
to
bash
the
Bush
adminstation
Most
recently
he
used
the
death
of
150,000
people
in
the
tsunami
disaster
to
criticize
the
Bush
administration
for
its
stinginess
Leahy
has
also
played
the
role
of
conspiracy
theorist
at
times
calling
for
an
investigation
of
ties
between
the
Bush
administration
and
Halliburton
His
latest
play
at
attention
is
par
for
the
course
At
issue
is
Gonzales
legal
opinion
that
the
rules
of
the
Geneva
Convention
do
not
apply
in
cases
of
detainees
in
the
war
on
terror
Contrary
to
what
Leahy
would
have
you
believe
Gonzales
did
not
order
the
abuses
at
Abu
Gharib
nor
did
he
call
for
the
torture
of
prisoners
He
simply
called
for
new
rules
given
the
new
challenges
of
this
war
To
be
honest
it
seems
the
only
people
hurt
by
the
Geneva
Convention
are
the
soldiers
of
the
United
States
U.S
soldiers
were
tortured
in
World
War
II
the
Korean
War
Vietnam
and
the
Gulf
War
I'm
not
saying
we
should
torture
enemy
combatants
who
have
been
captured
during
the
war
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
However
to
call
the
relatively
minor
questioning
methods
used
by
the
military
torture
when
we're
fighting
an
enemy
that
cuts
off
heads
and
blows
up
children
seems
ridiculous
even
for

What's
Bothersome
About
Whitman
The
news
that
former
Governor
and
EPA
chair
Christine
Todd
Whitman
has
written
a
book
critical
of
the
Bush
administration
shows
the
extent
to
which
moderates
are
about
self-promotion
rather
than
a
political
swing
bloc
of
any
power
The
moderates
in
the
Republican
party
are
almost
pathologically
addicted
to
media
coverage
Whitman
Sen
John
McCain
Sen
Olympia
Snowe
Sen
Susan
Collins
Sen
Chuck
Hagel
Rather
than
work
with
conservatives
and
the
administration
to
form
coalitions
and
solve
problems
these
attention
seeking
camera
hounds
race
each
other
to
the
news
media
The
media
enables
this
behavior
by
ignoring
Democratic
moderates
Zell
Miller
Joe
Lieberman
and
making
that
party
seem
like
a
perfect
bastion
of
liberalism
The
Republican
mavericks
are
always
held
up
though
as
evidence
that
the
party
is
falling
apart
at
the
seams
To
give
this
impression
ignores
the
fact
that
Republicans
have
won
the
last
three
election
cycles
and
are
on
their
way
to
majority
status
And
they've
done
this
without
listening
to
the
nattering
nabobs
like
Whitman
and
McCain
Republicans
are
winning
because
of
religious
conservatives
and
a
solid
message
The
Democrats
and
moderates
would
have
you
believe
this
is
all
a
coincidence
and
due
to
negative
campaigning
and
an
evil
plan
by
Karl
Rove
Ms
Whitman
believes
she's
not
welcome
in
the
party
because
of
religious
conservatives
She's
wrong
Her
lack
of
influence
in
the
party
is
more
due
to
her
need
to
be
popular
in
the
media
than
work
with
those
she
demands

his

Muslims
Angry
at
24
The
Council
on
American-Islamic
Relations
a
Muslim
advocacy
group
is
angry
that
Muslims
are
being
portrayed
as
terrorists
on
24
They
say
that
showing
a
family
of
Muslims
plotting
terrorist
activity
creates
an
atmosphere
in
which
many
Americans
look
at
all
Muslims
as
suspects
in
the
war
on
terror
Well
there's
a
stretch
Maybe
here's
something
they'll
understand
24
is
a
television
show
It's
based
in
the
reality
that
in
the
past
decade
or
so
Muslims
have
been
responsible
for
most
of
the
terrorist
acts
in
the
world
CAIR
manufactures
outrage
over
television
shows
movies
and
creates
hate
crime
statistics
to
hide
the
fact
that
Americans
for
the
most
part
have
not
returned
the
hatred
that
Islamic
fascists
have
shown
to
us
CAIR
should
spend
more
time
trying
to
moderate
the
rhetoric
of
their
own
community
and
less
time
attacking
those
who
create
plausible
fiction

Four
Years
Later
And

still
misses
Bill
Clinton
This
article
in
the
Washington
Post
revises
and
extends
the
comments
by
Jan
Egeland
of
the
United
Nations
regarding
the
stinginess
of
the
United
States
It
throws
a
little
Bush-bashing
into
the
mix
to
boot
Although
U.N
Emergency
Relief
Coordinator
Jan
Egeland
yesterday
withdrew
his
earlier
comment
domestic
criticism
of
Bush
continued
to
rise
Skeptics
said
the
initial
aid
sums
as
well
as
Bush's
decision
at
first
to
remain
cloistered
on
his
Texas
ranch
for
the
Christmas
holiday
rather
than
speak
in
person
about
the
tragedy
showed
scant
appreciation
for
the
magnitude
of
suffering
and
for
the
rescue
and
rebuilding
work
facing
such
nations
as
Sri
Lanka
India
Thailand
and
Indonesia.Yes
after
a
natural
disaster
of
Biblical
proportions
with
their
relatives
lying
dead
around
them
and
their
cities
destroyed
I'm
sure
the
people
of
Sri
Lanka
India
Thailand
and
Indonesia
were
thinking
what
I
really
could
use
is
a
presidential
proclamation
of
sorrow
Read
the
rest
of
the
article
though
try
to
find
the
domestic
criticism
of
which
the
author
speaks
Two
people
are
quoted
One
is
Leslie
H
Gelb
who
has
been
a
critic
of
the
administration
on
the
war
The
other
is
an
anonymous
State
official
the
Washington
Post's
favorite
kind
of
source
Actions
speak
louder
than
words
President
Bush
has
sent
the
military
to
the
area
aid
is
already
arriving
and
more
is
on
its
way
We
have
pledged
millions
as
a
government
and
people
are
giving
more
on
their
own
Gelb's
comments
about
impressing
Muslims
with
the
good
we
do
in
Indonesia
ring
false
given
how
the
Muslim
world
has
responded
to
our
goodwill
in
the
past
We
rescued
Muslims
from
tyranny
in
Iraq
saved
them
from
ethnic
cleansing
in
Bosnia
and
Kuwait
and
have
provided
assistance
in
countries
like
Somalia
If
they
haven't
understood
yet
that
we
are
a
benevolent
country
they
never
will
Maybe
that
should
make
people
like
Gelb
understand
that
we're
hated
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
actions
it's
who
we
are
not
what
we
do
that
makes
us
the
enemy
of
radical
Islam
Personally
I
think
it's
great
that
Bush
doesn't
participate
in
the
lip-biting
I
feel
your
pain
empathy
B.S
the
media
wants
him
to
show
In
this
case
the
American
people
seem
to
be
responding
quite
well
on
our
own
We
don't
need
the
president
to
feel
for
us

My
first
response
to
these
comments
by
the
UN
Undersecretary-General
for
Humanitarian
Affairs
was
colorful
but
unprintable
Jan
Egeland
said
the
United
States
and
other
Western
nations
were
being
stingy
with
relief
funds
for
those
affected
by
the
earthquakes
and
tsunamis
in
Asia
and
suggested
our
tax
rates
were
too
low
for
us
to
be
truly
generous
Egeland's
comments
on
how
much
the
United
States
has
given
are
bad
enough
but
his
clumsy
and
ill-informed
foray
into
our
domestic
tax
policy
shows
an
incredible
level
of
arrogance
Maybe
he
doesn't
realize
it
but
humanitarian
funds
given
to
the
United
Nations
have
a
way
of
disappearing
into
the
pockets
of
its
own
employees
The
United
Nations
is
in
the
midst
of
a
scandal
involving
the
son
of
the
secretary
general
and
many
others
who
stole
money
from
poor
people
in
Iraq
to
line
their
own
pockets
Maybe
Kofi
should
encourage
his
son
Kojo
to
donate
some
of
his
blood
money
to
help
those
in
Asia
I
wonder
how
much
of
the
15
to
25
million
the
United
States
has
pledged
to
aid
tsunami
victims
will
end
up
in
the
bank
accounts
of
UN
officials
What's
their
cut
If
the
United
States
really
wants
to
help
the
people
of
Asia
while
ticking
off
the
United
Nations
it
should
give
those
relief
funds
to
organizations
like
World
Vision
Compassion
Samaritan's
Purse
the
Red
Cross
and
other
nonprofits
with
proven
records
of
success
in
handling
disaster
relief
Egeland's
comments
display
not
only
arrogance
but
an
ignorance
of
American
compassion
We
don't
need
to
be
compelled
to
give
by
the
government
In
the
wake
of
this
disaster
millions
of
Americans
will
donate
what
they
can
to
humanitarian
organzations
to
help
those
affected
by
the
tsunamis
My
wife
and
I
will
be
writing
a
personal
check
to
help
Will
Kofi
Annan
and
Jan
Egeland
do
the
same
Or
does
their
compassion
end
where
their
bank
accounts
begin
UPDATE
Ace
has
a
great
post
on
this
subject
using
all
the
words
I
wanted
to
use
Strong
language
but
no
one
does
a
primal
scream
of
rage
quite
as
well
UPDATE
II
Egeland
has
backed
off
his
earlier
comments
saying
the
response
of
the
United
States
was
quick
and
generous
Someone
at
the
United
Nations
obviously
had
a
talk
with
Egeland
probably
informing
him
that
US
opinion
of
the
UN
was
pretty
low
already
and
his
comments
would
not
help
that
relationship
much
To
Egeland's
discredit
though
he
didn't
apologize
Instead
he
suggested
that
his
comments
were
misinterpreted
Nice
beginning
but
many
of
us
still
want
all
of
you
to
just
go
away
Wouldn't
you
be
happier

head
of
their
party
will
determine
the
direction
of
the
party
and
by
extension
its
electoral
future
The
Democrats
have
some
work
ahead
of
them
if
they
want
to
remain
competitive
in
2006
and
2008
There
are
two
major
tasks
that
need
doing
one
they
need
to
get
rid
of
the
moonbats
MoveOn
ACT
ACORN
George
Soros
etc
These
people
are
the
liberal
equivalent
of
the
Pat
Buchanan
brigade
in
the
Republican
party
of
the
early
1990s
Second
keep
the
Clintons
away
from
the
reigns
It
was
the
issue-free
presidency
of
Bill
Clinton
that
allowed
Bush
to
win
two
terms
The
Democrats
have
moved
away
from
their
ideological
roots
into
a
realm
of
spin
and
marketing
In
the
short
term
and
with
the
right
spokesman
this
worked
wonders
for
them
in
the
1990s
Without
the
charisma
of
Bill
Clinton
and
it's
some
pretty
tarnished
charisma
by
now
by
the
way
the
party
cannot
maintain
their
electoral
advantage
against
the
ideas
of
the
Republicans
The
next
great
hope
of
the
Dems
seems
to
be
Hillary
Clinton
Nominating
her
would
be
a
mistake
I
know
a
lot
of
conservatives
who
fear
the
prospect
of
a
Hillary
candidacy
I'm
not
one
of
them
Hillary
is
a
terrible
campaigner
whose
charm
is
a
media
construct
how
often
have
you
actually
seen
Hillary
show
a
human
side
Not
very
All
of
the
information
we
have
about
her
funny
personable
side
come
from
media
accounts
I've
seen
Hillary
make
a
speech
to
a
friendly
crowd
and
noted
her
almost
complete
inability
to
connect
to
them
They
cheered
for
her
because
she
was
Hillary
not
because
of
what
she
said
And
they
didn't
cheer
all
that
often
Sure
the
media
would
give
her
a
free
ride
in
2008
Sure
they
would
ignore
her
shady
past
But
the
media
aren't
the
dominant
information
force
they
were
in
the
1990s

anymore
are

Movies
of
2004
I
was
at
Borders
this
afternoon
and
flipped
through
Entertainment
Weekly
In
it
Stephen
King
posted
his
favorite
movies
of
the
year
Unlike
movie
critics
who
put
pretentious
pieces
of
crap
on
their
lists
King
lists
movies
he
actually
liked
and
admits
to
liking
That's
a
good
approach
In
that
spirit
here
are
some
of
my
favorites
and
least
favorite
of
the
year
The
Passion
of
the
Christ
This
was
a
powerful
and
moving
film
It
won't
be
given
any
awards
but
it
will
be
watched
long
after
people
forget
about
whatever
winds
Best
Picture
this
year
Gibson
created
a
violent
and
disturbing
film
that
somehow
manages
to
be
beautiful
The
Incredibles
Fantastic
movie
This
movie
like
The
Iron
Giant
also
written
by
Brad
Bird
proves
that
animation
doesn't
have
to
be
just
for
kids
The
movie
has
a
great
story
amazing
animation
and
themes
that
deal
with
the
importance
of
family
Spider-Man
2
Who
would
have
thought
one
of
the
most
emotionally
compelling
movies
of
2004
would
be
about
a
guy
who
dresses
in
tights
and
swings
from
buildings
Everything
about
this
movie
clicked
the
humor
the
reveal
at
the
end
the
villian
the
relationship
between
Peter
and
his
aunt
It
all
worked
and
the
special
effects
were
better
to
boot
Dawn
of
the
Dead
Okay
it
wasn't
a
masterwork
but
it
was
scary
and
fun
Hellboy
Another
good
comic
book
film
Ron
Perelman
was
born
to
play
the
role
of
Hellboy.Now
what
were
the
worst
or
most
disappointing
movies
I
saw
this
year
Van
Helsing
What
a
waste
Vampires
werewolves
frankenstein's
monster
how
could
you
go
wrong
How
about
a
wretched
plot
stilted
acting
and
an
overabundance
of
special
effects
Starsky
Hutch
Ben
Stiller
is
funny
Owen
Wilson
Funny
Both
are
terrible
at
picking
scripts
The
movie
had
its
moments
but
didn't
work
overall
The
Bourne
Supremacy
The
constantly
moving
camera
work
made
it
hard
to
see
just
what
the
heck
was
going
on
It
was
basically
the
same
movie
as
The
Bourne
Identity
Maybe
my
expectations
were
too
high
but
I
wasn't
as
impressed
as
I
thought
Karl
Urban
was
good
in
it
and
it
was
cool
to
see
parts
of
Moscow
I
recognized
but
it
wasn't
enough.2005
looks
as
though
it
will
be
a
good
movie
year
with

Post-Christmas
America

Boxing

After
all
of
the

to
Christmas
it
seems
a

to
confine
the

For

my

brave

telling
us

are

how

now
the

of
three

two

In
those
days
a
decree
went
out
from
Caesar
Augustus
that
all
the
world
should
be
registered
This
was
the
first
registration
when
Quirinius
was
governor
of
Syria
And
all
went
to
be
registered
each
to
his
own
town
And
Joseph
also
went
up
from
Galilee
from
the
town
of
Nazareth
to
Judea
to
the
city
of
David
which
is
called
Bethlehem
because
he
was
of
the
house
and
lineage
of
David
to
be
registered
with
Mary
his
betrothed
who
was
with
child
And
while
they
were
there
the
time
came
for
her
to
give
birth
And
she
gave
birth
to
her
firstborn
son
and
wrapped
him
in
swaddling
cloths
and
laid
him
in
a
manger
because
there
was
no
place
for
them
in
the
inn
And
in
the
same
region
there
were
shepherds
out
in
the
field
keeping
watch
over
their
flock
by
night
And
an
angel
of
the
Lord
appeared
to
them
and
the
glory
of
the
Lord
shone
around
them
and
they
were
filled
with
fear
And
the
angel
said
to
them
Fear
not
for
behold
I
bring
you
good
news
of
a
great
joy
that
will
be
for
all
the
people
For
unto
you
is
born
this
day
in
the
city
of
David
a
Savior
who
is
Christ
the
Lord
And
this
will
be
a
sign
for
you
you
will
find
a
baby
wrapped
in
swaddling
cloths
and
lying
in
a
manger
And
suddenly
there
was
with
the
angel
a
multitude
of
the
heavenly
host
praising
God
and
saying
Glory
to
God
in
the
highest
and
on
earth
peace
among
those
with
whom

Liberal
Nonsense
At
the
mall
today
I
saw
a
car
with
the
bumper
sticker
When
Clinton
Lied
No
One
Died
My
first
thought
was
hey
at
least
they're
admitting
he's
a
liar
now
My
second
thought
The
bumper
sticker
is
a
lie
Clinton's
lies
about
his
sexual
relations
with
Monica
Lewinsky
led
to
his
impeachment
by
the
House
of
Representatives
To
distract
the
Congress
from
its
duties
Clinton
bombed
the
heck
out
of
Iraq
most
likely
denying
thousands
of
Iraqis
a
good
source
of
painkillers
for
years
and
killing
those
who
were
under
the
bombs
In
other
words
Clinton
lied
people
died
And
to
take
people's
attention
off
of
his
political
problems
Clinton
put
the
lives
of
American
soldiers
at
risk
On
September
11
America
was
attacked
by
terrorists
who
had
support
of
regimes
like
that
of
Hussein
In
order
to
protect
us
from
future
attacks
and
help
defeat
Islamic
totalitarianism
Bush
decided
on
a

of
military
action
in
Iraq

Expectations
Game
Just
got
back
from
the
mall
which
was
quite
busy
While
driving
from
one
store
to
another
the
radio
news
said
economists
and
retail
experts
were
disappointed
in
this
year's
sales
and
hoping
for
a
last-minute
surge
It
seems
our
purchasing
didn't
meet
expectations
this
year
If
that's
the
case
what
on
earth
were
the
expectations
Were
retailers
assuming
that
every
customer
was
going
to
spend
10,000
The
economy
has
been
growing
for
months
consumer
confidence
and
spending
are
up
and
retailers
still
aren't
happy
Some
of
this
is
simple
capitalism
the
more
we
spend
the
happier
retailers
are
Part
of
it
though
is
completely
unrealistic
expectations
on
the
part
of
corporations
and
stockholders
Set
yourself
up
to
be
disappointed
and
you
will
be
And
our
media
will
be
right
there
to
report
the
bad
news
Because
after
all
it
reflects
badly
on
the
economy

Noonan
and
Christmas
Peggy
Noonan
reminds
us
what
Christmas
is
really
about
and
remembers
her
favorite
gift
When
I
think
of
past
Christmases
I
don't
really
remember
looking
forward
to
one
gift
more
than
any
other
What
I
enjoyed
as
a
child
was
midnight
mass
at
the
base
chapel
One
it
was
shorter
than
regular
mass
which
was
always
good
Two
it
almost
always
ended
with
everyone
lighting
a
candle
and
singing
Silent
Night
I
remember
thinking
it
was
something
special
and
not
just
because
I
got
to
hold
fire
After
the
midnight
mass
we
would
all
go
back
home
and
open
one
gift
Choosing
which
gift
to
open
was
always
hard
because
you
really
didn't
want
to
open
socks
or
something
like
that
You
wanted
the
good
stuff
Star
Wars
toys
Legos...that
sort
of
thing
It
never
seemed
to
occur
to
me
as
a
child
that
the
other
presents
were
just
a
few
hours
away
It
still
doesn't
really
Opening
presents
is
still
a
source
of
joy
Our
family
has
a
shark
feeding
frenzy
approach
to
the
opening
of
gifts
we
dive
into
the
gifts
paper
flies
everywhere
and
a
few
minutes
later
we're
all
enjoying
the
gifts
we've
been
given
My
wife's
family
on
the
other
hand
has
a
different
system
They
make
a
day
or
two
of
it
Everyone
sits
in
a
circle
and
someone
is
chosen
to
hand
out
the
first
gift
They
pick
a
gift
for
someone
else
and
all
watch
as
that
person
opens
the
gift
Then
that
person
picks
a
gift
for
another
and
so
on
It
takes
about
four
hours
with
breaks
for
coffee
and
tea
Unfortunately
I
let
on
too
early
that
I
really
enjoy
tearing
open
presents
at
lightspeed
so
guess
who
doesn't
get
picked
to
open
a
present
that
often
It's
fun
in
a
sort
of
strange
way
This

race
OLYMPIA
Wash
Democrat
Christine
Gregoire's
improbable
rally
in

Washington
governor's
race
picked
up
steam
on
two
fronts
in
a

recount
that
nudged
her
10

into

lead

in

column.Read
over

again
Improbable
rally
Dino
Rossi's
241
vote
lead
was
too
close
to
call
His
41
vote
lead
was
a
tie
But
when
a
Democrat
takes
the
lead
by
fewer
than
a
dozen
votes
Momentum
time
Honestly
I
think
the
Republicans
will
fight
this
one
but
have
secretly
resigned
themselves
to
losing
The
Democrats
have
the
deck
stacked
on
this
one
Democrat
voting
boards
judges
and
other
public
officials
are
calling
the
shots
An
election
has
been
stolen
right
under
our
noses
It
should
be
interesting
to
see
how
Christine
Gregiore
is
able
to
lead
a
state
that
did
not
elect
her
Look
for
Rossi
to
run
against
Senator
Maria
Cantwell
in
2006
and
win
Governor
Gregiore
probably
shouldn't
grow
too
comfortable
in
the
state
house
either
since
she
will
probably
be
un-elected
as
quickly
as
the
voters
who
didn't
elect
her
in
the
first
place
can
get
around
to
it
The
situation
is
a
disgrace
but
it's
one
Republicans
can
work
to
their
advantage
if
they
try
hard
enough
They
simply
cannot
let
the
Democrats
spin
this
one
as
a
victory
for
democracy
because
all
the
votes
were
counted
Once
Gregoire
is
sworn
in
Republicans
should
respect
the
office
of
governor
while
pointing
out
the
problems
with
the
state's
voting
systems
If
they
focus
their
anger
on
the
way
Washington
votes
rather
than
going
the
Dem
route
of
encouraging
disrespect
for
the
office
the
political
advantage
will
be
greater
It
will
also
ensure
that
future
elections
won't
be
stolen
as
easily

Beyond
Parody
In
the
first
count
of
votes
in
the
Washington
gubernatorial
race
Republican
Dino
Rossi
won
by
241
votes
Democrats
called
it

and
demanded
a
recount
After
the
recount
Rossi
was
still
ahead
this
time
by
42
votes
Democrats
called
it
a
tie
and
paid
for
a

recount

all
ballots
During

hand
recount
process
Democrats
pulled
some
funny
business
and
now
Christine
Gregoire
is
ahead
by
eight

The

Seen
on
MSNBC
A
rocket
attack
on
a
mess
hall
has
the
worst
news
network
on
television
asking
whether
the
insurgents
are
winning
It's
a
ridiculous
question
that
could
only
be
asked
by
a
media
who
want
the
effort
in
Iraq
to
fail
It
seems
to
me
that
if
the
insurgents
are
attacking
mess
halls
and
resorting
to
terrorist
attacks
it's
not
a
sign
of
confidence
Another
stupid
question
asked
on
MSNBC
and
in
the
major
media
is
whether
Iraq
is
secure
enough
to
hold
elections
at
the
end
of
next
month
I
think
that
if
those
elections
are
held
and
people
show
up
to
vote
it
will
be
a
major
blow
to
the
terrorists
The
insurgents
had
a
success
and
American
troops
died
That's
what
happened
yesterday
The
media
and
especially
MSNBC
should
be
ashamed
of
their
attempts
to
turn
a
single
attack
into
a
sign
of
defeat
for

Bloggermann's
Obsession
Keith
Olbermann
refuses
to
give
up
on
the
idea
of
vote
fraud
in
Ohio
On
December
15
he
wrote
about
how
Rep
John
Conyers
is
planning
to
contest
the
certification
of
the
electoral
votes
in
January
Because
you
know
that
worked
so
well
last
time
Of
course
in
order
to
challenge
the
vote
Conyers
needs
a
Senator
If
he
couldn't
find
one
in
2000
where
the
vote
was
much
closer
he
won't
find
one
now
which
makes
this
a
nonstory
That
Olbermann
is
reporting
on
this
shows
just
how
desperate
he's
becoming
to
find
stories
Today
he's
sorting
out
the
various
claims
about
election
fraud
with
his
commentary
Needless
to
say
among
his
beliefs
is
that
there
is
no
liberal
media
His
actual
quote
I
think
we
can
pretty
much
put
this
one
to
bed
Right
Keith
That
the
media
is
refusing
to
spend
time
and
money
investigating
fradulent
claims
of
voter
irregularities
shows
a
terrible
conservative
bias
He
also
tries
to
argue
that
fascism
is
a
right-wing
invention
and
that
socialism
was
was
almost
ironic
in
intention
Wonderful

Pro-Family
Groups
and
the
War
Thanks
to
a
sore
knee
and
the
spectacular
ineptitude
of
a
certain
community
charity
agency
I'm
in
a
somewhat
grouchy
mood
this
afternoon
Reading
the
latest
nonsense
from
so-called
pro-family
groups
made
me
even
more
annoyed
Various
anti-porn
groups
are
complaining
that
outgoing
Attorney
General
John
Ashcroft
and
the
Bush
administration
have
not
used
the
vast
resources
of
the
federal
government
to
fight
porn
Now
I'm
all
in
favor
of
prosecuting
the
dirtbags
who
peddle
smut
with
children
or
underage
models
I
think
pornography
is
generally
destructive
and
does
hurt
families
Okay
disclaimer
over
However
it's
this
type
of
myopic
vision
that
makes
pro-family
groups
so
politically
ineffective
Organizations
with
a
single
focus
tend
to
look
at
all
issues
through
the
rather
distorted
lens
of
their
own
interests
and
fail
to
see
the
bigger
picture
Both
conservatives
and
liberals
are
guilty
of
this
but
conservatives
are
more
likely
to
allow
their
own
personal
beliefs
about
one
issue
keep
them
from
supporting
a
candidate
or
officeholder
who
agrees
with
them
on
99
percent
of
other
issues
I'm
sure
the
Bush
administration
agrees
that
pornography
is
a
problem
and
they
have
used
the
powers
of
the
Justice
Department
to
deal
with
the
worst
offenders
However
what
these
pro-family
groups
have
to
realize
is
that
we
are
in
a
war
with
people
who
want
us
dead
Porn
is
troubling
but
not
as
troubling
as
the
thought
of
terrorism
within
our
borders
Rather
than
issue
useless
press
releases
about
the
poor
record
of
the
Bush
administration
when
it
comes
to
porn
why
don't
these
groups
actually...you
know...do
something
about
it
Conservative
interest
groups
seem
to
have
grown
just
as
dependent
on
government
action
as
their
liberal
counterparts
Yes
only
the
government
can
prosecute
and
punish
those
who
offend
But
these
groups
can
educate
on
the
dangers
of
pornography
and
how
parents
can
protect
themselves
and
their
children
and
provide
legal
and
other
assistance
to
municipalities
dealing
with
local
porn
shops
They
can't
solve
the
whole
problem
on
their
own
but
they
can
do
quite
a
bit
The
government
has
other
more
important
things
on
its
plate
right
now
These
groups
should
perhaps
gain
a
sense
of
perspective
and
some
patience

Mr

Shut
Up
Susan
Maine
Senator
sigh
sorry
guys
Susan
Collins
has
joined
the
chorus
criticizing
Secretary
of
Defense
Donald
Rumsfeld
Collins
it
seems
has
realized
there's
an
opportunity
here
for
the
moderates
and
media
who...uh...hogs
to
teach
President
Bush
a
lesson
Look
for
more
of
this
from
the
RINOs
They
were
just
as
shocked
as
Democrats
by
how
the
country
responded
to
the
conservative
message
of
the
president
and
can
feel
their
power
waning
within
the
party
Collins
Hagel
and
especially
McCain
understand
the
ability
they
have
to
command
media
attention
by
criticizing
their
own
party
There's
no
story
the
media
loves
more
than
Republicans
breaking
ranks
with
the
president
As
with
the
intelligence
bill
Collins
is
trying
to
vaingloriously
recreate
the
days
when
Maine
had
influential
senators
like
Margaret
Chase
Smith
Edmund
Muskie
George
Mitchell
and
William
Cohen
What
Collins
doesn't
seem
to
realize
is
that
by
electing
her
Maine
voters
have
already
lowered
their
standards
for
what
makes
a
good
senator
Collins
benefitted
in
the
primary
from
infighting
in
the
impotent
Maine
Republican
party
and
a
weak
Democrat
candidate
who
people
were
tired
of
seeing
on
the
ballot
In
her
first
re-election
campaign
she
had
a
laughably
weak
opponent
In
other
words
she
has
not
yet
earned
the
status
of
a
Muskie
or
a
Smith
Judging
by
her
weak
performance
in
the
senate
thus
far
and
her
total
abandonment
of
Republican
issues
in
favor
of
media
adulation
she
never
will
I
can
promise
my
out-of-state
readers
that
when
Collins
runs
again
we'll
try
to
put
up
a
primary
candidate
to
run
against

It's

Random
Thought
Driving
to
lunch
today
I
was
briefly
behind
the
car
of
a
liberal
How
did
I
know
it
was
a
liberal
Well
it
was
pretty
easy
Maine
is
a
liberal
state
so
seeing
the
back
of
a
car
literally
covered
with
bumper
stickers
is
nothing
unusual
I
couldn't
help
but
think
that
liberals
are
always
calling
President
Bush
stupid
and
accuse
conservatives
of
having
a
simplistic
worldview
If
we're
the
ones
with
the
simplistic
worldview
then
why
are
liberals
more
often
the
ones
who
define
their
political
philosphy
with
bumper-sticker
logic
and
cute
catchprases
line
credit
Supertones
Of
course
I
would
be
hard-pressed
to
tell
you
what
this
person
actually
believed
as
99
percent
of
the
bumper
stickers
on
his
car
communicated
to
the
world
his
hatred
of
Bush
On
the
plus
side
though
he
didn't
have
a
Kerry/Edwards
sticker
on
his
car
like
so
many
other
liberals
The
stickers
of
the
losing
ticket
seem
to
be
staying
on
cars
far
longer
this
year
Perhaps
it's
a
passive-aggressive
form
of
protest

refusal
to
acknowledge
the
truth

Noonan
and
Faith
Peggy
Noonan
says
one
way
for
Democrats
to
reconnect
with
people
of
faith
is
to
take
a
stand
for
Christmas
The
hostility
shown
toward
people
of
faith
over
the
past
few
years
was
one
of
the
reasons
I
believe
for
Bush's
re-election
victory
The
removal
of
under
God
from
the
Pledge
of
Alleigance
the
Ten
Commandments
controversy
which
I
thought
was
rather
overblown
by
Christians
and
the
current
struggles
Christians
have
to
recognize
one
of
their
most
important
holidays
all
show
a
growing
liberal
intolerance
of
public
displays
of
Christian
faith
Noonan
points
out
that
when
Christians
look
at
Bush
they
see
a
man
who
is
sincere
about
his
faith
and
his
mentions
of
God
When
Kerry
spoke
the
G-word
he
often
sounded
uncomfortable
with
it
sometimes
almost
blurting
it
out
in
embarrassment
at
how
low
he
had
to
stoop
to
win
the
object
of
his
ambitions
I'm
not
suggesting
that
we
have
a
litmus
test
in
this
country
for
public
office
based
on
one's
religious
beliefs
All
I
want
is
for
liberals
to
extend
some
of
their
rumored
tolerance
to
those
of

Never

Democrats
are
still
complaining
about
Ohio
Let's
hope
they
keep
this
up
In
2000
Bush
won
Florida
by
537
votes
In

after
four
years
of
Democratic
whining
about
the
stolen
election
Bush
won
the
state
by
over
300,000
votes
This
year
Bush
won
Ohio
by
119,000
votes
If
the

keep
claiming
fraud
and
looking
backwards
instead
of
trying
to
figure
out
why
they
lost
I
figure
whoever
runs
on
the
Republican
ticket
in
2008
can
look
foward
to
a
500,000
victory
margin
in
Ohio
When
are
Democrats
going
to
realize
they
lost
because
they
ran
a
lousy

with
no

Unless
they
start
focusing
on

an

commercial
Here
I
am
watching

during

I'm
accused

a

routinely
turn

Okay

made

up
Still
the

is
galling
It
shows
two
bouncers
letting
mostly
white
people
into
a
church
and
turning
away
a
gay
couple
and
some
minorities
Then
the
words
Jesus
didn't
turn

away
Neither
do
we

The

then
randomly

focuses

all
I'm

that

What
does
Newsweek's
story
on
Christmas
tell
us
about
MSM
In
the
fall
of
2004
Dan
Rather's
60
Minutes
had
an
exclusive
story
Newly
discovered
documents
and
sources
seemed
to
confirm
the
worst
about
President
George
W
Bush
and
his
service
in
the
Texas
Air
National
Guard
The
story
ran
on
September
8
and
was
eagerly
embraced
by
the
national
media
For
a
few
hours
CBS
News
was
on
top
of
the
world
They
had
run
a
story
no
one
else
had
that
cast
doubt
on
the
president's
service
in
the
military
and
more
importantly
made
the
president
look
bad
The
celebration
was
short-lived
Within
a
few
hours
bloggers
began
to
compile
evidence
that
cast
doubt
on
the
authenticity
of
the
memos
and
the
story
fell
apart
A
week
later
Rather
was
forced
to
concede
he
had
lost
faith
in
the
accuracy
of
the
memos
This
week
Newsweek
ran
a
story
by
Jon
Meacham
entitled
The
Birth
of
Jesus
The
story
uses
new
scholarship
and
the
work
of
skeptics
to
cast
doubt
on
the
Biblical
accounts
of
Jesus
birth
and
life
At
a
time
when
antipathy
toward
religious
conservatives
is
high
due
to
the
role
evangelicals
played
in
re-electing
George
W
Bush
the
story
seems
to
confirm
what
many
would
like
to
believe
about
the
Gospels
that
they
are
a
mix
of
the
true
the
false
and
have
pagan
roots
The
story
also
plays
into
the
anti-Christian
bias
that
has
been
part
of
the
entertainment
news
and
public
media
over
the
past
year
From
the
furor
over
the
alleged
anti-Semitism
in
The
Passion
of
the
Christ
to
the
popularity
of
the
mildly
entertaining
but
theologically
ludicrous
DaVinci
Code
the
media
has
shown
a
growing
willingness
to
attack
those
of
faith
As
with
the
Bush
memos
story
Newsweek's
skeptical
story
on
Christmas
and
the
origins
of
Christianity
is
destined
to
become
yet
another
embarrassing
chapter
in
media
bias
and
cluelessness
about
faith
Already
there
has
been
considerable
doubt
placed
on
the
claims
of
the
article
by
writers
on
the
internet
Albert
Mohler
and
Mark
D
Roberts
have
taken
to
the
web
to
respond
to
the
Newsweek
article
and
point
out
where
Meacham
was
wrong
Albert
Mohler
president
of
the
Southern
Baptist
Theological
Seminary
examines
the
author
of
the
story
and
given
the
evidence
he
complies
about
Meacham's
beliefs
based
on
what
is
written
in
the
article
shows
the
Newsweek
writer
is
willing
to
spread
heresy
in
order
to
justify
his
own
personal
beliefs
Mohler
says
describes
Meacham
as
the
classic
self-congratulatory
theological
liberal
and
shows
the
shallowness
of
his
scholarship
in
the
Newsweek
article
Pastor
Mark
D
Roberts
examines
the
Newsweek
article
at
length
over
a
five-part
series
Roberts
raises
many
of
the
same
questions
as
did
Mohler
Roberts
gives
more
evidence
of
Meacham's
theological
liberalism
and
gives
examples
from
his
own
life
of
dealing
with
people
who
put
their
own
personal
beliefs
about
God
above
what
scripture
teaches
Although
both
writers
are
critical
of
Meacham
they
resist
the
urge
to
engage
in
the
same
sort
of
condescension
the
Newsweek
writer
repeatedly
uses
in
his
article
Meacham
draws
a
bright
line
between
literalists
who
believe
the
Bible
is
literally
true
and
those
of
a
more
nuanced
faith
who
believe
in
a
more
historical
Jesus
Meacham
speaks
warmly
of
Gnosticism
A
complex
movement
popularly
known
as
Gnosticism
from
the
Greek
gnosis
meaning
knowledge
offered
an
apparently
compelling
and
appealing
version
of
Christianity
in
which
believers
sought
in
addition
to
received
teaching
inner
knowledge
of
God
Insight
or
gnosis
was
the
experience
of
searching
for
the
divine
the
source
of
our
creation
within
oneself
says
Elaine
Pagels
professor
of
religion
at
Princeton...Meacham's
blend
of
scriptural
truth
and
pagan
beliefs
is
in
fact
a
form
of
the
very
thing
he
quotes
approvingly
Meacham
skillfully
blends
scriptural
truth
personal
belief
and
pagan
theology
into
his
Newsweek
narrative
of
the
birth
of
Jesus
The
end
result
is
a
readable
but
ultimately
false
view
of
scripture
I'm
not
a
theologian
though
To
fully
understand
the
depth
of
Meacham's
deception
read
the
articles
by
Mohler
and
Roberts
I
want
to
examine
a
point
raised
well
by
both
authors
and
what
it
says
about
the
mainstream
media
Both
Mohler
and
Roberts
point
out
that
Meacham
spoke
to
only
one
side
of
the
theological
argument
on
an
issue
of
great
importance
For
this
reason
the
Newsweek
article
for
all
its
seeming
sophistication
and
intelligence
is
nothing
more
than
yet
another
example
of
the
bias
pervasive
in
the
media
Most
of
the
experts
Meacham
quotes
are
liberal
scholars
whose
work
has
cast
doubt
on
what
scripture
teaches
about
Jesus
and
mocked
those
who
believe
in
absolute
truth
Meacham
is
a
product
of
our
culture
of
permissiveness
and
postmodernism
It
is
obvious
reading
his
article
that
the
author
is
uncomfortable
with
the
actual
life
of
the
Jesus
he
claims
to
worship
Similar
feelings
arose
during
the
debate
over
Mel
Gibson's
The
Passion
of
the
Christ
Critics
complained
about
the
movie's
excessive
violence
and
its
focus
on
Christ's
suffering
and
wondered
why
Gibson
didn't
focus
more
on
what
Christ
actually
taught
Of
course
to
those
of
a
more
liberal
theological
persuasion
Christ's
teachings
basically
boil
down
to
be
nice
to
each
other
and
government
entitlements
are
good
So
what
does
Meacham's
postmodernism
have
to
do
with
media
bias
The
media
is
one
of
the
most
postmodern
entities
in
the
country
While
journalists
make
a
huge
issue
out
of
seeking
truth
the
actual
definition
of
truth
is
rather
vague
A
document
called
Ten
Ethical
Principles
for
College
Journalists
contains
a
statement
that
is
both
unintentionally
hilarious
and
deeply
disturbing
Objective
truth-like
flawless
beauty-is
an
illusive
goal
Nonetheless
just
as
human
beings
pursue
many
aims
that
can
never
be
fully
achieved
it
remains
a
worthy
endeavor
for
journalists
to
commit
themselves
to
trying
to
tell
the
truth
Postmodernism
proclaims
the
truth
that
truth
is
an
illusion..."The
truth
that
truth
is
an
illusion
The
statement
goes
on
to
say
that
while
truth
may
be
an
illusion
journalists
should
always
strive
to
tell
it
The
most
common
definition
of
truth
in
journalism
is
found
in
the
old
saying
speaking
truth
to
power
This
makes
truth
a
constant
contrarian
and
presupposes
that
all
of
those
who
have
power
are
spreaders
of
untruth
This
definition
of
truth
is
the
one
that
drives
all
of
journalism
the
seeking
of
truth
is
the
tearing
down
of
powerful
people
and
institutions
There
is
little
constructive
in
this
defining
of
truth
but
it
is
where
Meacham
has
planted
his
flag
When
one
examines
truth
in
this
light
it's
easy
to
see
how
Meacham
could
have
written
such
a
blatantly
biased
article
how
Dan
Rather
could
have
used
such
obvious
forgeries
and
how
Michael
Moore
can
justify
making
propaganda
films
filled
with
lies
In
the
eyes
of
these
postmodernists
a
few
inaccuracies
are
forgivable
if
they
lead
the
public
to
an
understanding
of
the
higher
truth
being
sought
that
Bush
was
a
bad
soldier
that
the
war
in
Iraq
was
a
mistake
and
that
Jesus
wasn't
the
Christ
There
is
a
wonderful
symmetry
between
what
Meacham
has
said
about
scripture
and
the
Rathergate
story
In
Mohler's
article
he
points
out
a
statement
by
Mohler
on
Chris
Matthews
Hardball
in
which
Meacham
says
scriptures
can
be
true
without
being
accurate
Shortly
after
the
memos
were
found
to
be
forgeries
the
New
York
Times
ran
a
story
with
the
following
headline
Memos
on
Bush
Are
Fake
But
Accurate
Typist
Says
In
a
word
it
is
postmodernism
that
accounts
for
the
appearance
of
this
piece
in
a
major
news
magazine
This
is
what
modern
journalism
has
been
reduced
to
sacrificing
truth
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
Meacham
is
so
desperate
to
prove
that
modern-day
evangelicals
are
simpleminded
buffoons
who
believe
in
fairy
tales
that
he
is
willing
to
ignore
the
experts
and
evidence
that
disagree
with
his
rather
liberal
interpretation
of
scripture
Meacham
is
seeking
a
comfortable
Christianity
a
nonthreatening
version
of
Jesus
In
doing
so
he's
cast
aside
truth
I'll
end
with
a
quote
from
C.S
Lewis
that
Meacham
may
want
to
consider
the
next
time
he
ignores
scripture
in
search
of
the
higher
truth
If
you
look
for
truth
you
may
find
comfort
in
the
end
if
you
look
for
comfort
you
will
not
get
either
comfort
or
truth
only
soft
soap
and
wishful
thinking
to
begin
and
in
the
end

Insomnia-Blogging
I
can't
sleep
so
I'm
flipping
around
the
cable
channels
looking
for
something
interesting
I
usually
default
to
either
Fox
News
or
the
Discovery
Channel
Discovery
is
showing
an
episode
of
Monster
Garage
that
I've
already
seen
and
Fox's
new
motto
seems
to
be
All
Peterson
All
the
Time
I
didn't
follow
the
trial
of
Scott
Peterson
and
was
a
little
irritated
at
the
media's
attachment
to
the
case
As
you
have
doubtless
heard
the
jury
that
convicted
Peterson
of
death
recommended
that
he
receive
the
death
penalty
I
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
sentencing
recommendation
to
be
honest
I
wasn't
sure
they
would
do
it
I'm
not
a
supporter
of
the
death
penalty
After
the
O.J
Simpson
trial
and
my
own
brush
with
lawyers
judges
and
juries
I
lost
faith
in
the
judicial
system
The
Simpson
trial
was
a
blatant
case
of
people
making
a
political
point
at
the
expense
of
justice
for
two
dead
people
One
can
hope
that
the
jury
who
acquitted
Simpson
feel
some
guilt
over
their
decision
but
such
emotion
would
require
a
recognition
of
their
error
My
own
trial
was
a
civil
case
that
never
should
have
made
it
as
far
as
it
did
I
lost
control
of
my
car
on
the
interstate
and
was
struck
by
another
vehicle
The
driver
of
that
car
sued
me
and
it
went
to
trial
The
case
was
a
ridiculous
one
which
is
why
my
insurance
company
decided
to
fight
it
rather
than
settle
I
won
the
case
but
only
after
two
days
spent
in
a
courtroom
Not
to
mention
the
hours
I'd
spent
in
giving
depositions
to
both
sides
and
the
rather
unpleasant
experience
of
being
served
a
lawsuit
There
were
eight
jurors
in
my
civil
trial
and
one
of
them
found
for
the
plaintiff
I
shudder
to
think
of
what
would
have
happened
had
three
other
morons
voted
with
that
particular
juror
I'm
pretty
sure
I
know
which
one
it
was
the
lady
in
the
purple
sweatshirt
scowling
at
me
during
the
reading
of
the
verdict
Those
two
examples
have
given
me
a
jaundiced
view
of
the
legal
system
and
I'm
uncomfortable
with
it
having
the
power
to
sentence
a
fellow
citizen
to
death
I
have
other
reasons
for
my
opposition
to
the
death
penalty
religious
reasons
and
the
fact
that
I'm
just
too
libertarian
to
like
the
thought
of
the
government
having
that
much
power
but
such
arguments
have
been
hashed
over
again
and
again
by
those
on
both
sides
of
this
emotionally
charged
issue
Is
Peterson
guilty
From
what
I've
heard
probably
Does
he
deserve

no
political
fallout
only
media
fallout
We're
in
yet
another
situation
where
the
media
is
creating
a
story
that
it
then
reports
Kind
of
like
the
polls
we
heard
about
throughout
the
election
season
I
guess
the
only
criteria
for
what
makes
a
story
these
days
is
how
much
that
story
will
make
the
Bush
administration
look
bad
I
thought
the
media
would
calm
down
after
almost
completely
trashing
their
credibility
during
the
election
I
was
wrong
This
is
going
to
be
a
long
four
years
On
the
good
news
front
though
Olbermann
seems
to
have
given
up
on
the

fraud
story
A
promo
I
just
saw
for
his
show
promised
a
countdown
of
the
most
annoying
holiday
songs
Oh
Keith...how
far
you've
fallen
Of
course
I
might
actually
watch
that
I
have
a
fondness
for
stupid
countdown

Still

never

In

between

and

Rumsfeld
on
a

of
issues
including
troop

and

It's

for
Senator
McCain
to
disagree
with
the
administration
What
bothers
me
is
that
he
aired
his
opinions
to
the
media
instead
of
keeping
them
between
him
and
the
president
Such
behavior
and
his
comments
show
that
the

has

ego

an

pathological

Kerry's
campaign
it's
telling
such
a
thing
still
exists
is
asking
elections
officials
in
Ohio
to
look
at
93,000
undervotes
when
they
recount
the
ballots
in
that
state
Even
if
all
93,000
of
those
votes
went
to
Kerry
that
would
still
leave
President
Bush
with
a
25,000
vote

Captain's
Quarters
to
whom
a
hat
tip
is
owed
on
this
story
has
some
good
thoughts
on
why
Kerry
is
doing
this
To
its
credit
Ohio
is
standing
firm
against
Kerry
and
his
attempts
to
either
steal
the
election
or
delegitimize
the
Bush
presidency
These
actions
by
the
former
Democrat
candidate
show
that
Kerry
is
not
a
patriot
Yup
I'm
questioning
his
patriotism
A
patriot
is
defined
as
one
who
loves
supports
and
defends
one's
country
Kerry
may
tell
himself
that
his
actions
fall
under
that
definition
becuase
he
loves
the
country
enough
to
ensure
that
every
citizen
has
their
vote
counted
or
some
such
puerile
crap
A
true
patriot
however
would
love
his
country
enough
to
concede
gracefully
wait
I
thought
he
already
did
that
and
respect
the
election
process
Kerry
obviously
is
not
such
a
man
His
backdoor
attempts
to
challenge
the
results
of
the
election
show
that
he
doesn't
care
how
much
damage
he's
doing
to
the
election
process
He
just
wants
to
win
It
also
shows
that
he's
a
coward
If
he
wanted
to
mount
a
true
challenge
he
should
have
done
it
by
now
instead
of
pretending
to
be
statesmanlike
just
after
the
election
while
having
every
intent
of
contesting
the
results
The
flip-flopper
once
again
wants
to
have
it
both
ways
seeming
gracious
while
acting
in
a
contrary
fashion
Al
Gore
did
serious
damage
to
the
election
process
in
2000
John
Kerry
wants
to
continue
Gore's
pernicious
legacy
but
with
nuance
No
matter
what
route
Kerry
takes
he
still
wants
to
achieve
the
same
result
damage
the
other
party
at
the
expense
of
trashing
our
political
process

Compare

Read
this
editorial
in
the
Bangor
Daily
News
about
auto
emissions
standards
a
move
that
would
make
living
in
Maine
even
more
expensive
than
it
is
already
Then
read
this
a
speech
by
Michael
Crichton
about

science
Now
ask
yourself
Is
consensus
of
scientists
a
good
enough
reason
to
take
steps
that
will
further
hurt
the
U.S
economy
UPDATE
A
reader
emailed
me
to
point
out
that
in
some
states
the
standard
is
so
low
as
to
be
ridiculous
and
that
some
standards
are
needed
I
wholeheartedly
agree
and
should
clarify
my
point
on
this
one
There
should
be
a
standard
for
vehicle
emissions
All
of
us
have
probably
experienced
the
joys
of
being
behind
a
badly-tuned
car
or
one
missing
a
catalytic
converter
The
exhaust
coming
out
of
such
cars
is
unpleasant
to
say
the
least
A
well-tuned
car
or
one
with
a
working
converter
emits
few
pollutants
Eventually
I
would
like
to
see
manufacturers
produce
a
car
that
emits
little
to
no
pollutants
I
may
be
a
skeptic
on
global
warming
but
that
doesn't
mean
I
like
the
smell
of
car
exhaust
The
California
standard
which
Maine
wants
to
adopt
is
far
more
strict
It
wants
to
set
standards
at
a
level
based
on
the
very
science
that
Crichton
decries
in
his
speech
In
other
words
it's
making
the
perfect
the
enemy
of
the
good
A
state
inspection
should
ensure
that
vehicles
are
safe
and
well-maintained
Asking
too
much
too
soon
could
have
unintended
consequences
ranging
from
cars
we
can't
afford
to
putting
auto
workers
out
of

More
Condescension
from
the
Left
Jonathan
Chait
tries
to
explain
why
universities
don't
hire
Republicans
in
the
Los
Angeles
Times
It's
a
piece
that
just
cries
out
for
a
fisking
After
all
it's
a
cold
rainy/icy
day
here
in
Maine
and
there's
nothing
else
to
do
A
few
weeks
ago
a
pair
of
studies
found
that
Democrats
vastly
outnumbered
Republicans
among
professors
at
leading
universities
Conservatives
gleefully
seized
upon
this
to
once
again
flagellate
academia
for
its
liberal
bias
Am
I
the
only
person
who
fails
to
understand
why
conservatives
see
this
finding
as
vindication
After
all
these
studies
show
that
some
of
the
best-educated
most-informed
people
in
the
country
overwhelmingly
reject
the
GOP
Why
is
this
seen
as
an
indictment
of
academia
rather
than
as
an
indictment
of
the
Republican
Party?If
we're
so
dumb
then
why
do
we
even
bother
complaining
I
mean
if
conservatives
are
poorly-educated
and
among
the
least-informed
peole
in
the
country
then
why
do
we
even
consider
this
an
issue
If
we
were
as
dumb
as
Chait
thinks
we
are
there
wouldn't
be
conservatives
looking
to
attend
or
teach
at
colleges
But
blast
it
all
conservatives
actually
do
attend
college
thus
ruining
the
liberal
party
and
disproving
Chait's
first
assumption
Next
Conservatives
have
a
ready
answer
The
only
reason
faculties
lean
so
far
to
the
left
is
that
deans
administrators
and
entire
university
cultures
systematically
discriminate
against
conservatives
They
don't
however
have
much
evidence
to
back
this
up.Other
than
of
course
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
us
conservatives
that
have
attended
college
and
been
harassed
by
liberal
professors
conservative
professors
being
denied
tenure
liberals
stealing
conservative
publications
on
campuses
and
going
unpunished
I
could
go
on
but
Chait
is
so
laughably
wrong
here
that
it's
not
necessary
Mostly
they
assume
that
the
leftward
tilt
is
prima
facie
evidence
of
anti-conservative
discrimination
Yet
when
liberals
hold
up
minority
underrepresentation
at
some
institutions
as
proof
of
discrimination
conservatives
are
justifiably
skeptical.)Oh
so
now
it's
okay
to
be
justifiably
skeptical
about
claims
of
bias
by
minorities
whereas
before
it
was
considered
racism
to
even
suggest
there
wasn't
bias
And
who
once
charged
racism
Liberals
like
Chait
of
course
Conservative
pundit
George
Will
recently
tied
the
dearth
of
conservative
professors
to
the
quasi-Marxist
outlook
in
African
American
studies
women's
studies
and
cultural
studies
And
at
many
campuses
those
departments
certainly
don't
amount
to
much
more
than
left-wing
propaganda
factoriesSo
um
why
do
they
exist
Because
college
administrators
who
are
overwhelmingly
liberal
don't
mind
having
such
left-wing
propaganda
factories
in
their
schools
Plus
the
classics
are
full
of
books
by
dead
white
guys
oppressors
all
It's
also
true
that
radical
multiculturalist
theory
which
sees
white
male
oppression
as
the
key
to
everything
has
taken
root
in
plenty
of
more
mainstream
disciplines.Hate
to
tell
you
this
Jon
but
that
theory
has
taken
root
in
the
Democratic
party
as
well
After
all
the
reason
we
don't
have
good
vote
reform
is
because
every
time
Republicans
suggest
common-sense
approaches
to
the
question
like
making
ID
mandatory
or
purging
voter
rolls
liberals
cream
that
all
we
want
to
do
is
oppress
minority
voters
This
no
doubt
makes
things
hard
on
prospective
conservative
academics
not
to
mention
mainstream
liberal
ones
A
historian
I
know
a
liberal
used
to
complain
that
history
departments
showed
little
interest
in
the
traditional
research
he
did
only
caring
about
subjects
like
buggery
in
the
British
navy.'While
in
college
I
took
an
American
history
class
where
the
professor
taught
history
from
the
1800s
to
the
present
entirely
from
the
perspective
of
minorities
That
wouldn't
be
terrible
if
I
had
signed
up
to
take
a
class
like
that
But
this
wasn't
an
elective
It
was
the
required
history
of
the
United
States
all
first-year
students
had
to
take
I
often
disagreed
with
the
professor
and
got
C's
on
all
of
my
papers
I
don't
say
this
to
brag
but
in
most
all
of
my
other
classes
my
average
grade
on
a
paper
was
A
I
learned
too
late
that
to
disagree
with
this
professor
meant
a
bad
grade
in
the
course
But
the
rise
of
fashionable
left-wing
scholarship
can
be
blamed
for
only
a
tiny
part
of
the
GOP's
problem
The
studies
showing
that
academics
prefer
Democrats
to
Republicans
also
show
that
this
preference
holds
in
hard
sciences
as
well
as
social
sciences
Are
we
to
believe
that
higher
education
has
fallen
prey
to
trendy
multiculturalist
engineering
or
that
physics
departments
everywhere
suppress
conservative
quantum
theorists?Obviously
Mr
Chait
has
never
read
a
junk
science
paper
by
a
so-called
hard
science
professor
that
tries
to
prove
the
latest
screeching
by
extreme
environmentalists
is
justified
Being
a
liberal
he's
probably
never
sat
in
a
science
class
and
experienced
the
scorn
that
religious
conservatives
feel
from
hard
science
professors
who
shun
the
very
idea
of
God
being
responsible
for
the
creation
of
the
world
No
there's
no
liberalism
whatsoever
in
the
sciences
Totally
objective
The
main
causes
of
the
partisan
disparity
on
campus
have
little
to
do
with
anything
so
nefarious
as
discrimination
First
Republicans
don't
particularly
want
to
be
professors
To
go
into
academia
a
highly
competitive
field
that
does
not
offer
great
riches
you
have
to
believe
that
living
the
life
of
the
mind
is
more
valuable
than
making
a
Wall
Street
salary
On
most
issues
that
offer
a
choice
between
having
more
money
in
your
pocket
and
having
something
else
a
cleaner
environment
universal
health
insurance
etc
conservatives
tend
to
prefer
the
money
and
liberals
tend
to
prefer
the
something
else
It's
not
so
surprising
that
the
same
thinking
would
extend
to
career
choices.Remember
earlier
when
Chait
complained
that
conservatives
don't
have
much
evidence
to
prove
that
liberals
control
campuses
Here's
where
he
proves
that
he's
a
true
liberal
the
rules
he
expects
you
to
play
by
don't
apply
to
him
He
offers
supposition
after
supposition
in
these
paragraphs
After
all
does
he
really
need
to
offer
evidence
Everyone
knows
Republicans
love
money
and
hate
the
environment
and
poor
people
When
it
comes
to
the
choice
between
money
and
helping
someone
in
need
sign
me
up
for
the
cash
Second
professors
don't
particularly
want
to
be
Republicans
In
recent
years
and
especially
under
George
W
Bush
Republicans
have
cultivated
anti-intellectualism
Remember
how
Bush
in
2000
ridiculed
Al
Gore
for
using
all
them
big
numbers?Great
line
The
only
problem
is
it's
not
true
Bush
ridiculed
Gore
because
his
math
didn't
add
up
Gore
thought
he
could
provide
tax
cuts
while
paying
for
dozens
of
new
programs
It
didn't
make
sense
and
Bush
pointed
that
out
Cheap
shot
by
Chait
but
what
else
is
new
That's
not
just
a
campaign
ploy
It's
how
Republicans
govern
these
days
Last
summer
my
colleague
Frank
Foer
wrote
a
cover
story
in
the
New
Republic
detailing
the
way
the
Bush
administration
had
disdained
the
advice
of
experts
And
not
liberal
experts
either
These
were
Republican-appointed
wonks
whose
know-how
on
topics
such
as
global
warming
the
national
debt
and
occupying
Iraq
were
systematically
ignored
Bush
prefers
to
follow
his
gut.Again
where's
the
evidence
That
the
Bush
administration
didn't
do
what
the
experts
wanted
him
to
do
That
just
can't
be
Doing
that
would
cause
chaos
You
can't
ignore
the
experts
and
hope
to
survive
as
a
country
Except
um
we
have
And
Bush
was
re-elected
Maybe
the
experts
aren't
as
smart
as
they
think
they
are
Chait
just
can't
face
the
fact
that
academics
even
conservative
ones
may
be
unnecessary
to
running
the
country
In
the
world
of
academia
that's
about
the
nastiest
thing
you
can
say
about
somebody
Bush's
supporters
consider
it
a
compliment
Republicans
from
Reagan
to
Bush
admire
leaders
who
are
straight-talking
men
of
faith
The
Republican
leader
doesn't
have
to
be
book
smart
wrote
conservative
New
York
Times
columnist
David
Brooks
a
week
before
the
election
Democrats
on
the
other
hand
are
more
apt
to
emphasize...being
knowledgeable
and
thoughtful
They
value
leaders
who
see
complexities
who
possess
the
virtues
of
the
well-educated
It
so
happens
that
in
other
columns
Brooks
has
blamed
the
dearth
of
conservative
professors
on
ideological
discrimination
In
fact
the
GOP
is
just
being
rejected
by
those
who
not
only
prefer
their
leaders
to
think
complexly
but
are
complex
thinkers
themselves
There's
a
problem
with
this
picture
all
right
but
it
doesn't
lie
with
academia.Typical
It's
not
our
fault
It's
your
fault
for
being
stupid
You're
too
dumb
to
see
how
dumb
you
are
Chait
ignores
something
I've
seen
quite
a
bit
having
worked
at
a
university
Liberals
make
terrible
leaders
and
campuses
are
among
the
worst-run
organizations
in
the
world
Let
me
give
you
an
example
The
university
wanted
to
build
an
addition
onto
the
chemistry
building
Money
was
spent
to
bring
in
engineers
and
architects
to
draft
plans
Things
moved
forward...until...someone
noticed
a
problem
There
was
a
tree
in
the
way
More
to
the
point
an
elm
The
elm
was
more
dead
than
alive
and
held
together
with
concrete
I'm
not
kidding
dutch
elm
disease
had
taken
its

One
of

them

his

Ditto
with
Senator
Kerry
Men

no

Chait
has
a
problem
with
conservatives
and
the
president
He's
spent
the
past
few
months
defending
Bush-hatred
and
spreading
crude
stereotypes
about
those
who
disagree
with
him
Given
his
love
of
academia
and
the
general
low
quality
of
his
writing
of
late
maybe
it's
time
for
Chait
to
avail
himself
of
an
academic
tradition
and
take
a
sabbatical

ABC

only
five
minutes
to
cover
what
it
considers
the

each

It
took
one
minute
or
so
of
its
alloted
time
to
talk
about
a
major
financial
scandal
involving
a
large
organization
Is
the
major

finally
discovering
the
oil-for-food
scandal
Fat
chance
The
major
scandal
they
were
talking
about
was
of
course
Halliburton
and
whether
the
no-bid
contracts
they
were
offered
for
work
in
Iraq...blah...blah...blah
It's
the
same
old
story
over
and
over
again
The
media
only
gets
outraged
over
financial
stories
when
conservatives
are
the
ones
who
are
alleged
to
have
done
something
wrong
Hillary

cattle

No
story
Terry
McAuliffe
and
Global

Nothing
Kofi

family
and
the
UN

billions
from
Iraqis
Not
a
peep
You
see
only
Republicans
are
greedy
Only
conservatives
love
money
When
liberals
make
money
illegally
they
are
given
a
pass
because
they
probably
feel
guilty
about
it
Not
us
conservatives
though
We
love
our
money
We
want
to
throw
it
in
a
tank
and
wallow
in
it
Especially
if
that
money
was
gained
through
some
awful
means
like
tax
cuts
The
oil-for-food
story
is
one
of
the
biggest
if
not
the
biggest
financial
scandal
of
all
time
The
media
is
staying
far
away
from
it
though
because
reporting
on
it
might
force
them
to
see
just
how
corrupt
the
United
Nations
really
is
Kofi
Annan
deserves
to
be
remembered
as
one
of
the
world's
worst
villains
Under
his
watch
the
UN
has
allowed
genocide
UN
troops
have
sexually
abused
refugees
Security
Council
members
were
bribed
to
ignore
a
tyrant
and
oppose
the
country
that
wanted
to
topple
that
tyrant
the
Palestinian
cause
has
been
celebrated
despite
or
worse
because
their
killing
of
Jews
in
Israel
The
United
Nations
is
a
sinkhole
a
money
pit
into
which
we
throw
far
too
much
funding
It's
time
to
stop
funding
the
United
Nations
until
they
reform
Tax
time
is
coming
up
and
it
enrages
me
to
think
that
some
of
the
taxes
I've
paid
over
the
past
year
have
gone
to
pay
the
costs
of
keeping
such
an
ineffective
and
corrupt
organization

A
Reader's
Lament
A
poster
hanging
in
my
local
library
illustrates
perfectly
the
love-hate
relationship
I
have
with
these
repositories
of
books
The
poster
has
a
picture
of
Toni
Morrison
strike
one
and
the
words
Elect
to
Read
a
Banned
Book
on
the
top
and
Campaign
for
the
Freedom
to
Read
on
the
bottom
That's
right
it's
Banned
Books
Week
or
month
or
whatever
at
the
library
Egad
I
hate
this
time
of
year
The
self-righteousness
with
which
the
American
Library
Association
promotes
the
idea
that
people
are
burning
and
banning
books
all
over
the
country
is
off-putting
to
me
since
their
idea
of
a
banned
book
all
too
often
means
a
book
with
liberal
themes
being
challenged
by
right-wing
nutjob
religious
types
note
in
this
site
that
stories
about
anti-Harry
Potter
protests
are
put
right
alongside
stories
about
the
Taliban
destroying
priceless
statues
Think
the
ALA
sees
a
connection
If
you're
a
parent
who
has
concerns
about
their
children
seeing
a
particular
book
then
the
ALA
thinks
you
most
likely
may
not
have
a
broad
knowledge
of
literature
or
of
the
principles
of
freedom
of
expression
and
that
regardless
of
specific
motives
all
would-be
censors
share
one
belief
that
they
can
recognize
evil
and
that
other
people
must
be
protected
from
it
For
more
condescension
read
this
article
Personally
I'm
not
big
on
the
idea
of
keeping
books
out
of
libraries
People
should
have
the
right
to
read
what
they
want
However
doing
commonsense
things
like
restricting
access
to
books
with
adult
subject
matter
shouldn't
be
equated
with
a
desire
to
ban
books
Keeping
a
book
in
the
collection
and
restricting
its
checkout
to
adults
is
an
acceptable
compromise
it
seems
to
me
Seems
the
ALA
doesn't
agree
The
American
Library
Association
opposes
all
attempts
to
restrict
access
to
library
services
materials
and
facilities
based
on
the
age
of
library
users.Common
sense
and
the
rights
of
parents
be
damned
it
seems
Your
youngster
wants
to
check
out
Pet
Semetary
or
Go
Ask
Alice
Sure
go
right
ahead
And
look
up
some
hardcore
pornography
on
the
free
internet
access
while
you're
at
it
We're
all
about
intellectual
freedom
here
The
ALA
and
libraries
really
talk
a
good
talk
about
freedom
of
expression
and
the
right
to
hear
controversial
subjects
and
read
unorthodox
authors
Until
that
is
a
conservative
book
is
placed
on
the
shelves
In
my
library
there
is
a
table
that
features
new
or
interesting
books
Throughout
the
campaign
season
the
books
have
been
reliably
anti-Bush
or
pro-liberal
ideas
Books
like
Legacy
by
Rich
Lowry
How
to
Talk
to
a
Liberal
by
Ann
Coulter
and
In
Defense
of
Internment
by
Michelle
Malkin
somehow
never
made
it
to
the
table
Usually
the
library
will
order
at
least
two
copies
of
books
like
My
Life
by
Bill
Clinton
or
Dude
Where's
My
Country
by
Michael
Moore
What
about
Legacy
One
copy
How
to
Talk
to
a
Liberal
One
copy
In
Defense
of
Internment
Not
available
Self-censorship
at
the
library
Perish
the
thought
Banned
Books
Week
would
be
a
lot
more
credible
if
the
library
weren't
such
extremists
in
their
positions
and
hypocrites
about
the
types
of
ideas
they
presented
to
patrons
If
you're
a
conservative
entering
a
library
it's
like
being
behind
enemy
lines
Which
to
me
is
the
real
scandal

A
New
Obsession
The
media
are
using
a
question
and
answer
session
to
Secretary
of
Defense
Donald
Rumsfeld
against
the
administration
They
are
focusing
on
the
question
of
one
soldier
in
particular
who
asked
about
armor
for
the
Humvees
Rumsfeld's
answer
was
typically
artless
but
sound
As
you
know
you
go
to
war
with
the
Army
you
have
They're
not
the
Army
you
might
want
or
wish
to
have
at
a
later
time.As
I
said
not
the
best
answer
he
could
have
given
but
he
did
recognize
the
need
and
promised
more
armor
is
on
the
way
As
Instapundit
notes
today
the
Army
has
always
had
to
improvise
on
the
battlefield
He
also
points
out
the
amazing
nature
of
the
exchange
a
low-ranking
soldier
was
allowed
to
question
a
top
cabinet
official
Predictably
Democrats
jumped
on
the
opportunity
to
do
some
criticism
The
Washington
Post
quotes
Rep
Ted
Strickland
Sen
Frank
Lautenberg
and
Sen
Christopher
Dodd
Let's
see
how
these
guys
voted
when
it
came
time
to
support
the
soldiers
HR
3289
Emergency
Supplemental
Appropriations
for
Defense
and
for
the
Reconstruction
of
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
for
FY
2004
Rep
Strickland
NayOkay
so
Strickland
is
a
craven
opportunist
He
called
Rumsfeld's
remarks
callous
What's
more
callous
Representative
Saying
what
Rumsfeld
said
or
voting
against
a
bill
that
provided
for
the
troops
Now
to
the
Senate
S
1689
Emergency
Supplemental
Appropriations
for
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
Security
and
Reconstruction
Act
2004
Sen
Dodd
Yea
Sen
Lautenberg
NayTo
his
credit
Senator
Dodd
did
the
right
thing
Why
didn't
the
Democrats
nominate
him
for
president
Senator
Lautenberg
who
called
Rumsfeld's
comments
contemptuous
is
also
craven
and
also
an
opportunist
who
doesn't
seem
to
realize
all
of
us
little
people
can
now
Google
the
way
he
votes
His
criticism
of
Rumsfeld
is
perfectly
acceptable
but
his
behavior
toward
the
troops
he
now
defends
is
contemptible

Wednesday
Thanks
to

Democrat
mantra
Count
till

state
The

is
claiming
the

still
empty
since

race
is
tied
Right
Someone
should
inform

Sore
Loser
that
a
42-vote
win
is
heartbreaking
to
the
loser
but
still
a
win
A
one-vote
win
would
be
a
win
The
Democrat
party
wants
to
redefine
winning
as
winning
by
a
particular
margin
so
as
to
maintain
the
patina
of
illigitimacy
they
have
tried
to
paint
on
Republican
officeholders
who
beat
Democrats
In

news
the

campaign
why
the

has
officially

Appropriately
enough
the

effort
Appropriate

Lehane
Vs

Chris
Lehane

are
debating
terrorism
on
Fox
News
right
now
Coulter
is
laughing
and
mocking
Lehane
and
the
little
weasel
is
getting
more
and
more
angry
Even
angry
though
he
sounds
like
Mickey
Mouse
with
a
bad
head
cold
Lehane
is
still
using
the
Michael
Moore-ish
rhetoric
about
Bush's
response
to
the
August
2001
memo
that
said
Osama
bin
Laden
wanted
to
attack
the
United
States
When
asked
what
Clinton
did
for
eight
years
Lehane
dodged
and
said
if
presented
with
the
same
memo
Clinton
would
have
ended
his
vacation
gone
back
to
Washington
and
ordered
the
military
to
bomb
an
insignificant
target
Okay
he
didn't
really
say
that
but
that
was
the
essence
of
his
remarks
He
really
believes
Clinton
would
have
done
something
to
prevent
the
attacks
of
September
11
You
know
because
he
showed
such
a
willingness
to
combat
terrorism
for
eight
years
Lehane
is
all

points

no

is

Disaster
Has
a
Name
The
Wall
Street
Journal
says
last-minute
negotiations
between
the
White
House
the
House
of
Representatives
and
the
Senate
helped
the
United
States
to
avoid
a
potential
disaster
In
this
case
the
potential
disaster
had
a
name
That
name
I'm
ashamed
to
say
is
Senator
Susan
Collins
of
my
home
state
of
Maine
Collins
wanted
to
put
the
intelligence
czar
between
the
President
and
the
Secretary
of
Defense
meaning
the
person
in
charge
of
intelligence
could
use
American
troops
without
the
knowledge
of
the
Pentagon
It's
exactly
the
type
of
stupid
idea
we've
come
to
expect
from
Senator
Collins
who
tends
to
oppose
good
things
like
tax
cuts
in
favor
of
making
sure
the
government
has
enough
money
Heaven
only
knows
why
Collins
thought
dismantling
the
military
chain
of
command
structure
would
work
Neither
of
Maine's
two
RINO
senators
are
anything

of

who

themselves
from
this
country
so
badly
that
they'll
lie
about
who
they
are
When
I
was
in
Russia
it
was
the
summer
of
2003
The
Iraq
war
had
started
a
few
months
before
and
tensions
were
high
between
American
and
Russian
diplomats
Did
I
pretend
to
be
Canadian
so
that
I
would
be
liked
by
the
Russians
I
met
Nope
When
someone
asked
what
country
I
was
from
I
told
them
the
truth
Ya
Amerikanets
I
am
an
American
Liberals
seem
to
believe
that
if
someone
doesn't
like
Americans
it's
our
fault
I
believe
that
if
I
tell
someone
I'm
an
American
and
they
respond
badly
it
tells
me
more
about
what
type
of
person
they
are
than
what
type
of
country
I
call
my
home
My
favorite
memory
of
my
time
in
Russia
one
I've
recounted
before
on
this
blog
is
when
our
group
was
at
a
park
in
Bryansk
When
the
people
at
the
park
found
out
we
were
Americans
they
came
to
speak
to
us
I
got
an
understanding
of
what
zoo
animals
go
through
we
were
asked
many
questions
about
America
and
what
it's
like
to
live
here
They
didn't
hate
America
They
may
have
disagreed
with
the
actions
of
the
Bush
administration
but
those
opinions
didn't
translate
to
a
hatred
of
us
It
was
a
fun
night
Liberals
who
celebrate
America-hatred
as
a
form
of
protest
against
the
Bush
administration
quite
simply
put
their
personal
ideology
before
their
love
of
country
They
love
America
only
when
America
does
what
they
want
and
that's
a
sad
commentary
on
the
type
of
people
that
make
up

modern

party
here

would
say
we

don't

NYTimes
vs
Democracy
The
editors
of
the
New
York
Times
obviously
miss
the
Augusta
National
story
Since
President
Bush
took
office
the
Times
has
been
consistently
negative
about
the
use
of
force
by
a
Republican
president
They
were
the
first
paper
to
use
the
word
quagmire
about
the
military
action
in
Afghanistan
They
almost
used
the
word
again
about
Iraq
and
have
spent
many
column
inches
detailing
every
bit
of
bad
news
they
can
find
about
the
war
This
story
is
no
exception
Seems
a
CIA
agent
in
Iraq
didn't
think
the
war
was
going
well
late
last
month
so
he
sent
a
cable
to
his
superiors
in
Washington
Somehow
in
the
midst
of
the
cleanup
of
the
CIA
by
its
new
director
Porter
Goss
this
cable
was
leaked
to
the
NY
Times
and
is
now
splashed
across
the
front
pages
Coincidence
The
CIA
is
one
of
the
most
incompetent
government
organizations
in
Washington
They
missed
the
whole
end
of
the
Cold
War
and
fall
of
Russia
They
didn't
see
September
11
coming
Their
information
caused
the
military
to
bomb
both
an
aspirin
factory
and
the
Chinese
embassy
The
former
director
called
the
case
for
WMDs
a
slam
dunk
The
CIA
is
overrated
overly
political
and
completely
ineffective
This
is
hard
for
me
to
say
since
I
have
always
had
a
positive
view
of
the
organization
Of
course
that
perception
was
shaped
by
Tom
Clancy
novels
and
old
Cold
War
movies
The
actual
CIA
has
shown
just
how
fictional
Jack
Ryan
really
is
The
CIA
is
terrible
at
actually
collecting
intelligence
but
excels
at
giving
NY
Times
reporters
really
juicy
anti-Bush
stories
CIA
officials
are
not
the
selfless
public
servants
of
popular
fiction
but
angry
bureaucrats
willing
to
damage
the
war
effort
to
make
the
president
look
bad
and
preserve
their
own
jobs
If
Porter
Goss
cannot
reform
the
CIA
the
president
and
Congress
should
seriously
consider
eliminating
the
organization
and
forming
a
new
intelligence-gathering
apparatus
The
United
States
needs
good
intelligence
to
carry
out
its
military
and
foreign
policy
goals
It's
not
getting
that
information
and
the
CIA
is
to
blame
The
intelligence
reform
bill
and
an
intelligence
czar
are
not
the
answer
no
matter
what
the
increasingly
obnoxious
Jersey
Girls
say
Being
the
widow
of
a
9/11
victim
may
get
you
media
sympathy
but
it
gets
you
no
credibilty
on
matters
of
national
security
The
CIA
needs
reform
not
another
layer
of
bureaucracy
To
put
it
simply
they
need
to
get
as
good
at
gathering
intelligence
as
they
are
at
leaking
it

Childishness
I
meant
to
post
about
this
earlier
but
got
busy
toward
the
end
of
the
day
Today's
Bangor
Daily
News
print
edition
has
a
headline
that
says
tax
changes
proposed
by
the
Bush
administration
will
punish
blue
states
The
story
isn't
in
the
online
edition
I
saw
the
headline
on
a
copy
at
work
The
change
in
tax
policy
is
one
that
affects
the
ability
of
taxpayers
to
take
a
credit
for
their
state
income
taxes
The
reason
it
affects
blue
state
voters
more
is
because
those
states
that
vote
Democratic
tend
to
have
higher
state
tax
rates
than
the
red
states
The
BDN's
headline
made
it
sound
as
though
the
Bush
administration
is
pursuing
a
tax
policy
that
punishes
those
who
didn't
vote
for
him
In
other
words
the
headline
writer
misrepresented
what's
in
the
story
to
take
a
cheap
shot
at
the
president
This
election
year
the
editorial
board
endorsed
Kerry
and
the
Democrats
in
a
Bush-bashing
editorial
I
guess
they're
still
angry
that
Bush
won
I
figured
that
after
the
election
journalists
who
threw
credibility
to
the
wind
in
order
to
help
Kerry
would
come
to
their
senses
and
try
to
regain
the
trust

Tax
Two-Step
Governor
John
Baldacci
is
promising
to
lower
our
property
taxes
by
increasing
dependence
on
the
income
and
sales
taxes
That's
the
essence
of
the
plan
developed
in
Augusta
this
month
Baldacci
wants
to
limit
municipal
taxes
by
increasing
state
aid
to
schools
So
instead
of
paying
for
schools
with
your
property
taxes
you'll
pay
for
them
with
all
the
other
taxes
Mainers
are
forced
to
put
out
The
plan
also
increases
refunds
for
property
owners
Someone
should
inform
the
governor
that
shifting
the
tax
burden
from
one
ledger
sheet
to
another
does
not
actually
lower
it
Lawmakers
in
Augusta
should
also
ask
the
governor
why
he's
increasing
spending
for
schools
instead
of
looking
at
ways
to
decrease
the
huge
financial
burdens
education
puts
on
local
budgets
A
bumper
sticker
in
New
Hampshire
says
it
well
it
takes
a
school
to
bankrupt
a
village
Maine's
school-age
population
has
fallen
four
percent
over
the
past
ten
years
but
school
spending
has
risen
over
50
percent
Where
is
the
money
going
and
why
aren't
we
consolidating
smaller
districts
into
larger
ones
The
governor's
plan
is
a
defensive
move
against
the
citizens
of
Maine
who
are
growing
angry
with
Augusta's
inability
to
decrease
the
enormous
tax
burden
placed
on
Maine's
citizens
Taxes
are
stifling
Maine's
businesses
and
driving
employers
out
of
the
state
All
the
while
Augusta
continues
to
spend
more
and
more
money
on
projects
that
are
doomed
to
failure
like
state
healthcare
Maine's
Republicans
being
who
they
are
I
expect
the
governor
will
have
little
resistance
Maine
is
becoming
a
one-party
state
and
we're
beginning
to
see
the
costs
Maine's
Republicans
have
to
wake
up
from
their
stupor
and
fight
back
or
risk
being
made
even
more
irrelevant
than
they
already
are

Moore's
Disease
They
should
do
it
soon
I
have
a
feeling
that
embittered
Hollywood
liberals
are
planning
to
nominate
Fahrenheit
9/11
for
an
Academy
Award
giving
Michael
Moore
a
new
platform
from
which
to
spout
his
noxious
and
dishonest
liberalism
Hollywood
simply
doesn't
care
that
Moore's
movies
are
based
in
lies
They
awarded
him
an
Oscar
when
he
made
Bowling
for
Columbine
despite
the
overwhelming
evidence
that
he
simply
made
stuff
up
to
fit
the
agenda
of
the
film
Voting
for
the
Academy
Awards
will
happen
in
January
just
as
President
Bush
is
being
inaugurated
If
Moore's
film
is
up
for
the
big
award
liberals
angry
over
the
election
might
vote
for
the
movie
just
because
they
feel
so
frustrated
at
being
unable
to
do
anything
about
the
fact
that
America
re-elected
the
president
That
would
be
a
bad
idea
especially
if
another
movie
is
ignored
Evangelicals
and
religious
audiences
responded
strongly
to
The
Passion
of
the
Christ
The
film
made
over
370
million
in
domestic
sales
despite
or
perhaps
because
of
the
publicity
surrounding
the
film's
allegedly
anti-semitic
themes
I
was
reading
a
copy
of
Premiere
magazine
at
the
barbershop
the
other
day
and
found
an
article
about
the
Oscar
hopes
for
various
films
A
Hollywood
executive
said
the
film
didn't
have
a
prayer
of
being
nominated
I
don't
know
if
Gibson's
film
is
the
best
of
the
year
It's
a
powerful
well-made
film
It
certainly
deserves
a
nomination
If
it
doesn't
get
nominated
and
Fahrenheit
9/11
does
there
will
likely
be
a
measure
of
anger
at
Hollywood
As
I've
said
before
if
Hollywood
wants
to
keep
people
who
love
movies
like
me
in
the
theater
seats
it
has
to
start
making
good
movies
again
The
political
views
of
actors
only
irritate
me
when
those
people
aren't
talented
enough
to
warrant
the
attention
they
get
Al
Franken
and
Janeane
Garafalo
come
to
mind
When
the
actor
is
talented
and
I
like
the
movie
I'm
willing
to
forgive
or
at
least
forget
for
a
couple
of
hours
their
politics
Of
course
it
would
be
better
still
if
actors
just
realized
we
don't
care
what
they
think

A
Man
the
Left
Should
Meet
Since
the
re-election
of
President
Bush
some
liberals
have
been
using
wild
rhetoric
to
describe
the
country's
condition
under
the
Bush
administration
The
moonbat
brigade
at
Democratic
Underground
have
talked
about
moving
to
Canada
as
they
don't
want
their
children
to
be
raised
in
a
fascist
regime
They
truly
believe
they
have
lost
rights
and
will
lose
more
under
President
Bush
To
these
people
we
are
living
in
an
era
of
persecution
and
fear
of
the
government
reigns
These
people
should
meet
Pastor
Lisitsina
Last
night
a
group
from
our
church
went
to
the
airport
to
meet
Pastor
Lisitsina's
flight
A
bonus
of
the
evening
was
getting
to
applaud
a
group
of
soldiers
that
were
there
on
a
layover
as
they
headed
back
home
to
Ohio
After
the
pastor's
plane
came
in
we
all
went
to
the
house
of
a
church
member
for
tea
and
dessert
It
was
late
but
it
seems
to
be
a
Russian
custom
to
drink
caffeinated
beverages
and
talk
until
long
past
bedtime
At
least
that's
what
they
did
to
us
when
we
visited
their
country
so
we
figured
it
was
payback
time
It
was
a
great
evening
As
his
daughter
translated
Pastor
Lisitsina
talked
about
the
church
in
Russia
and
being
a
believer
in
the
former
Soviet
Union
In
those
years
the
government
did
everything
it
could
to
destroy
the
church
Churches
were
made
to
register
with
the
government
Children
were
forbidden
to
attend
No
one
could
be
baptized
or
read
the
Bible
Distributing
Christian
literature
was
forbidden
The
KGB
would
routinely
interrupt
any
Christian
gathering
whether
it
was
a
wedding
or
a
group
of
friends
having
tea
Pastor
Lisitsina
and
his
fellow
believers
were
thrown
in
prison
for
their
faith
and
suffered
under
the
rule
of
the
Communists
Their
faith
in
God
got
them
through
those
terrible
years
and
now
churches
in
the
Bryansk
region
flourish
Every
time
the
left
whines
about
persecution
or
living
under
a
fascist
government
they
diminish
the
faith
and
courage
of
those
who
have
truly
survived
the
ridicule
and
tyrannical
rule
of
a
hostile
government
With
their
rhetoric
the
left
has
defined
persecution
as
anything
they
don't
like
In
doing
so
they
are
corrupting
the
language
Words
stop
meaning
one
thing
when
they
are
used
to
describe
everything
Those
who
use
strong
words
to
invent
stories
of
woe
should
talk
to
someone
who
has
truly
lived
under
a
regime
that
routinely
imprisoned
tortured
and
murdered
its
citizens
The
lack
of
historical
perspective
liberals
have
shown
over
the
past
few
years
is
almost
as
appalling
as
the
rhetoric
they
have
used
If
they
took
the
time
to
talk
to
men
of
courage
like
Pastor
Lisitsina
they
would
be
ashamed
of
their
adoption
of
the
language
of
suffering
Of
course
that
assumes
they
are
capable
of
shame
Given
their
behavior
lately
that
may
be
an
assumption
based
in
false
hope

often
setting

either

In
other
words
breaking

with
the

of

MoveOn
has
been
a
failure
from
the
beginning
They
were
founded
to
prevent
the
impeachment
of
President

They
were
unsuccessful
in
getting
people
to
vote
against
pro-impeachment
representatives
They
failed
at
getting
Al

elected
They
failed
in
the
2002
elections
They
failed
to
prevent
the
Iraq
war
And
this
year
they
failed
to
help
John
Kerry
Their
existence
though
has
proven
a
boon
to
the
Republicans
The
GOP
base
was
energized
by
disgust
for
the
leftist
organization
and
its
extreme
tactics
against
the

It's
good
to
see

I'm
Hatin
It
Just
got
back
from
the
McDonald's
drive-through
Ordered
one
thing
got
something
completely
different
Joe
Pesci
was
right
Now
I'm
having
french
fries
for
lunch
In
addition
to
getting
my
food
order
wrong
the
service
was
curt
and
surly
So
I
call
the
place
and
what
do
I
get
for
my
trouble
Graciously
the
manager
put
my
name
on
a
list
to
receive
a
free
meal
the
one
I
originally
ordered
It's
a
nice
move
but
seems
strange
to
have
the
answer
to
bad
service
be
an
invitation
to
the
same
place
you
received
the
bad
service
Lest
I
seem
like
a
customer
is
always
right
jerk
let
me
say
that
I've
worked
at
two
separate
McDonald's
restaurants
one
in
Virginia
Beach
Virginia
and
one
in
Bangor
Maine
I've
worked
in
both
the
ordering
window
and
the
food
window
of
the
drive-through
There
is
no
doubt
that
I
got
some
orders
wrong
However
this
is
the
second
time
this
has
happened
to
me
in
the
past
two
months
at
two
different
locations
and
I
don't
visit
the
Golden
Arches
all
that
often
Either
I'm
the
unluckiest
customer
in
the
world
or
the
big
M

slipping
a

A
few
years
ago
when
the

began
losing
market
share
they
restructured
their
business
model
and
put
the
focus
back
on
food
quality
and
good
service
It
seems
evident
they
simply
slapped
a
new
coat
of
paint
on
a
rusting
product
When
I
redeem
the
offer
of
a
free
meal
to
get
my

it
will
likely
be
my

Murderous
Mercy
Once
in
awhile
a
story
comes
along
that
exceeds
one's
capacity
for
horror
This
article
from
the
Netherlands
is
one
of
those
Here
is
the
lead
A
hospital
in
the
Netherlands
the
first
nation
to
permit
euthanasia
recently
proposed
guidelines
for
mercy
killings
of
terminally
ill
newborns
and
then
made
a
startling
revelation
It
has
already
begun
carrying
out
such
procedures
which
include
administering
a
lethal
dose
of
sedatives.What's
truly
awful
about
this
story
is
that
it's
not
completely
unexpected
The
Netherlands
is
the
first
country
to
approve
euthanasia
for
terminally
ill
patients
This
protocol
simply
expands
the
population
of
those
who
can
be
euthanized
to
infants
It's
a
logical
progression
of
an
appalling
practice
The
issue
here
doesn't
seem
to
be
whether
the
leaders
of
the
Netherlands
have
lost
their
moral
compass
That
they
already
have
is
obvious
The
issue
is
the
response
of
this
country
and
of
the
church
The
Vatican
has
responded
strongly
to
this
news
as
they
should
How
will
the
all-too-often
complacent
church
in
the
United
States
respond
Obviously
the
first
response
should
be
prayer
After
that
we
should
start
weaving
cords
Outrage
is
an
appropriate
response
to
this
egregious
lack
of
simple
human
decency
The
Netherlands
have
convinced
themselves
that
right
is
wrong
and
wrong
is
right
The
most
important
thing
the
church
in
America
can
do
though
is
ensure
that
those
who
agree
with
such
practices
never
gain
power
here
Pro-euthanasia
politicians
should
be
denied
positions
of
influence
This
news
makes
the
battle
over
our
courts
even
more
important
than
it
was
before
America
needs
judges
who
can
interpret
the
laws
relating
to
life
and
death
not
create
new
laws
that
allow
doctors
and
administrators
to
make
decisions
regarding
the
value
of
a
particular
life
The
battle
we
have
to
fight
is
one
of
prevention
not
response
We
can't
wait
until
it
starts
happening
here
to
fight
this
practice
It
has
to
start
now

There
are
still
campaigns
going
on
in
the
state
of
Lousiana
and
Polipundit
has
the
details
That
is
one
truly
odd
election
system
they
have
down
there
Speaking
of
elections
the
chances
of
Ohio
going
to
Kerry
are
nonexistent
He's
picked
up
an
additional
52,126
votes
among
the
provisionals
That
still
leaves
Bush
with
a
lead
of
over
125,000
votes
Looks
as
though
the
moonbats
are
going
to
have
to
find
another
battleground
Ohio
is
no
Florida
2000
Heck
Florida
04
is
no
Florida
00
I
really
hope
one
of
the
president's
initiatives
this
term
is
to
reform
our
election
system
The
changes
made
between
2000
and
2004
were
stupid
and
didn't
prevent
fraud
from
happening
The
idea
of
provisional
ballots
is
one
of
the
more
exceptionally
ridiculous
concepts
ever
devised
by
politicians
If
people
want
to
become
involved
in
the
political
process
and
vote
they
have
years
to
register
and
figure
out
where
their
polling
place
is
located
Voting
should
be
more
than
about
just
showing
up
and
casting
a
ballot
there
are
responsibilities
involved
for
those
who
want
to
participate
in
our
politics
Provisional
ballots
pander
to
the
ignorant
and
apathetic
among
us
To
minimize
fraud
voters
should
be
required
to
have
a
photo
identification
All
of
the
arguments
that
the
Democrats
throw
out
about
how
such
a
move
would
intimidate
minority
voters
are
just
so
much
hot
air
and
show
the
perpetual
habit
that
party
has
of
living
in
the
past
instead
of
the
present
People
are
required
to
show
IDs
to
get
on
a
plane
use
a
credit
card
or
join
the
gym
Why
shouldn't
the
same
requirement
hold
for
voting
Anything
else
invites
fraud
and
everytime
a
fraudulent
ballot
is
cast
a
legal
voter
is
disenfranchised
Those
who
have
been
caught
committing
fraud
should
be
punished
to
the
fullest
extent
of
the
law
At
present
voter
fraud
is
considered
a
small
crime
when
in
fact
it
is
a
felony
It
should
be
treated
as
such
Nothing
irritates
me
more
than
seeing
some
moron
who's
just
voted
twice
tee-heeing
on
television
about
his
or
her
mistake
Seeing
perpetuators
of
fraud
thrown
in
jail
would
discourage
future
incidences
of
the
crime
Groups
like
ACT
and
ACORN
should
be
the
first
investigated
this
election
season
what
happened
in
some
battleground
states
with
people
registering
Mary
Poppins
and
Mickey
Mouse
on
behalf
of
those
liberal
527s
is
disgraceful
Since
the
fraud
occurred
in
different
states
under
the
umbrella
of
the
same
organization
why
not
start
prosecuting
under
the
RICO
statues
If
those
laws
are
flexible
enough
to
prosecute
pro-life
groups
in
addition
to
the
mafia
why
shouldn't
they
be
used
to
crack
down
on
organized
cases
of
fraudlent
voter
registration
and
vote-casting
These
groups
willingly
or
not
were
engaged
in
and
paying
people
for
illegal
behavior
Throwing
a
few
of
the
leaders
in
jail
would
show
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
Hey
maybe
while
we're
at
it...has
anyone
seen
George
Soros
His
money
helped
pay
for
the
crime...okay
maybe
that
won't
work
but
it's
certainly
a
fun

Sajak
on
Hollywood
Pat
Sajak
has
written
a
short
but
wonderfully
outraged
piece
about
the
murder
of
Dutch
filmmaker
Theo
van
Gogh
by
Muslim
extremists
Yes
that
Pat
Sajak
The
deference
Hollywood
shows
to
Muslims
of
late
is
rather
curious
considering
how
antithetical
the
beliefs
of
the
Middle
East
are
to
the
liberal
norms
of
most
entertainers
There
has
not
been
a
movie
since
September
11
with
the
exception
of
Team
America
that
has
portrayed
Muslims
as
terrorists
or
in
a
bad
light
The
makers
of
The
Sum

Fears
even
went
so
far
as
to
change
the
Muslim
villians
of
Tom
Clancy's
book
upon
which
the
movie
is
based

neo-Nazi
white
supremacist
types
I'm
not

September

the
war

terror

see
an
end

the
selective
outrage

liberals
excel

displaying
If
that's
too
much
to
ask
I
would
like
to
see
a

movie
once

out
on
DVD
and
found
myself
wondering
why
a
comic
book
movie
is
better
than
most
of
the
new
releases
we've
seen
lately
Spider-Man
2
is
a
tale
for
our
times
It's
a
story
of
responsibility
of
doing
the
right
thing
even
if
it
means
making
sacrifice
The
movie
shows
the
limits
of
personal
indulgence
and
the
nobility
of
service
I
don't
want
to
politicize
the
movie
too
much
because
it's
just
a
great
story
so
let
me
just
say
that
I
knew
there
was
a

Gay-Baiting

Hugh

for
ways
to
highlight
new
blogs
for
which
we
are
all
grateful
is
soliciting
names
of
modern
novels
worth
rereading
I
love
to
read
and
have
read
many
of
my
favorite
books
over
and
over
again
Here
are
some
modern
novels
worth
at
least
one
look
The
Guns
of
the
South
by
Harry
Turtledove
No
one
does
alternate
fiction
like
Turtledove
and
this
book
is
his
master
work
It's
an
intelligent
well-written
novel
about
what
would
have
happened
had
the
south
won
the
Civil
War
with
a
little
help
from
futuristic
types
The
politics
and
culture
of
a
victorious
south
are
described
in
detail
I've
read
the
book
at
least
three
times
and
will
probably
do
so
again
in
the
future
Watership
Down
by
Richard
Adams
Yes
the
book
is
about
rabbits
But
it's
a
great
read
and
a
good
book
The
Chronicles
of
Narnia
and
The
Screwtape
Letters
by
C.S
Lewis
If
you've
never
read
the
Narnia
books
you're
denying
yourself
a
journey
into
a
land
you'll
enjoy
visiting
and
will
want
to
repeatedly
visit
The
second
book
a
series
of
letters
from
a
senior
devil
to
a
young
devil
are
hilarious
and
profound
at
the
same
time
I've
read
the
book
at
least
four
times
and
get
a
kick
out
of
it
each
time
Household
Gods
by
Harry
Turtledove
and
Judith
Tarr
Not
so
much
an
alternate
history
as
a
look
at
Roman
times
through
the
eyes
of
a
modern
woman
This
is
a
long
book
but
a
fun
and
surprisingly
educational
read
The
Poet
by
Michael
Connelly
Connelly
is
quite
simply
the
best
mystery/crime
writer
on
the
market
and
The
Poet
is
his
finest
work
I
love
his
Bosch
novels
but
have
read
this
one
over
and
over
Ender's
Game
by
Orson
Scott
Card
I
read
this
book
for
the
first
time
when
I
was
in
college
It
hasn't
lost
its
ability
to
entertain
and
captivate
The
book
is
good
enough
to
stand
on
its
own
but
if
you
need
another
reason
to
pick
up
a
copy
know
that
Card
is
a
Democrat
who
supported
President
Bush
this
year
a
rarity
in
the
community
of
authors
The
Stand
by
Stephen
King
I
know
many
people
are
turned
off
by
the
very
mention
of
Stephen
King's
name
but
the
man
can
write
The
Stand
is
a
classic
tale
of
good
and
evil
set
in
an
America
ravaged
by
a
biological
weapon
It's
not
for
every
reader
it
is
Stephen
King
but
the
book
is
excellent
for
those
who
want
to
lose
themselves
in
an
epic
tale
Plus
the
guy
is
a
hometown
boy
What
kind
of
Mainer
would
I
be
if
I
didn't
put
Bangor's
favorite
son
somewhere
on
the
list?These
are
only
a
few
of
the
books
I've
enjoyed
multiple
times
Maybe
your
tastes
are
different
from
mine
but
if
you
pick
up
any
of
these
books
you'll
at
least
have
a
few
hours
of
entertainment

Doom
Gloom
Despair
Right
on
schedule
the
media
stories
about
the
horrible
retail
picture
and
what
it
means
for
the
economy
have
begun
The
focus
of
the
stories
this
year
is
retail
behemoth
Wal-Mart
My
favorite
headline
thus
far
is
from
this
story
Fears
over
recovery
as
Wal-Mart
sales
stall
Wal-Mart
long
hated
by
the
media
has
suddenly
become
the
yardstick
by
which
to
measure
the
overall
retail
economy
The
issue
is
that
Wal-Mart
is
lowering
its
sales
expectations
this
year
prompting
fears
that
customers
may
not
be
as
willing
to
spend
money
this
holiday
season
Maybe
that's
true
Or
just
maybe
people
are
spending
their
money
somewhere
other
than
Wal-Mart
Some
concept
huh
Having
worked
at
the
Arkansas-based
retailer
for
years
I
know
how
panicked
store
and
district
managers
can
get
over
a
slight
blip
in
sales
numbers
I've
seen
managers
send
people
home
to
save
money
because
the
numbers
over
a
few
hours
didn't
match
those
of
last
year
only
to
be
understaffed
later
the
same
day
when
business
unexpectedly
picks
up
I
haven't
been
to
Wal-Mart
in
weeks
I
don't
especially
like
shopping
there
The
stores
are
packed
too
full
of
merchandise
giving
them
a
crowded
unclean
look
There
are
often
not
enough
cashiers
or
sales
associates
to
handle
the
number
of
people
shopping
at
a
given
time
and
the
store
often
doesn't
stock
enough
of
items
on
sale
Personally
I'd
rather
pay
a
little
more
than
put
up
with
the
hassle
that
I
get
when
shopping
at
the
Mart
On
the
other
hand
though
I
love
Wal-Mart's
sister
store
Sam's
Club
I
guess
I'm
just
a
sucker
for
big
bags
of
frozen
chicken
and
gallon
jars
of
pickles
Like
many
other
large
companies
I
think
Wal-Mart
has
gotten
complacent
in
its
success
and
is
now
suffering
the
effects
of
slacking
off
If
they
want
to
improve
sales
they
have
to
change
their
business
model
or
at
least
return
it
to
what
made
them
succesful
in
the
first
place
As
for
the
media
they
should
get
over
their
obsession
with
the
day
after
Thanksgiving
retail
stories
as
holiday
shopping
barometer
Sure
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
shop
that
day
but
there
are
many
more
like
me
who
avoid
the
stores
completely
I
don't
like
crowds
and
hate
traffic
This
is
going
to
be
a
good
holiday
season
The
mall
has
been
crowded
since
late
October
and
people
I
know
are
spending
more
this
Christmas
than
they
did
last
year
I
plan
to
do
the
same
since
I
have
a
job
this
season
Plus
I
plan
to
do
some
shopping
online
which
the
media
doesn't
seem
to
measure
The
media
should
calm
down
put
away
the
template
stories
and
write
about
something
else
Maybe
instead
of
spreading
discouragement
about
retail
sales
they
could
highlight
the
charities
that
need
help
this

Missions
versus
Mission
While
visiting
my
in-laws
for
Thanksgiving
this
week
I
had
the
opportunity
to
converse
with
students
from
Gordon
College
a
Christian
school
near
Boston
Massachusetts
One
of
the
students
was
a
friend
of
my
wife's
family
and
a
major
in
physics
and
math
The
other
was
majoring
in
biblical
studies
Both
are
incredibly
smart
and
talented
students
and
would
be
an
asset
to
whatever
business
or
organization
that
hires
them
When
I
asked
them
about
their
plans
after
graduation
both
informed
me
that
they
plan
to
go
into
missions
To
be
more
precise
both
planned
to
be
missionaries
abroad
The
answer
they
gave
both
encouraged
and
discouraged
me
since
I've
heard
it
from
so
many
other
enthusiastic
and
Godly
students
It
encouraged
me
because
it's
great
to
see
the
next
generation
of
Christianity
so
fired
up
about
serving
God
It
discouraged
me
though
because
I'm
not
sure
all
of
them
are
meant
to
be
missionaries
to
other
countries
Don't
get
me
wrong
I'm
all
in
favor
of
sending
people
to
spread
the
gospel
to
those
in
foreign
lands
In
recent
years
though
I
think
the
church
has
promoted
foreign
missions
to
such
an
extent
that
we
aren't
encouraging
those
graduating
from
college
to
make
a
difference
in
their
own
communities
and
country
Christians
consistently
complain
about
a
coarsening
of
the
culture
in
America
Our
movies
books
television
shows
and
music
are
evidence
of
a
massive
cultural
shift
toward
a
celebration
of
the
profane
Christians
are
right
to
complain
about
this
trend
but
are
in
some
ways
responsible
for
it
The
American
church
has
become
so
focused
on
the
romanticism
of
the
foreign
mission
that
we've
largely
ignored
cultural
trends
closer
to
home
Christians
who
are
talented
in
the
areas
of
music
filmmaking
or
writing
are
encouraged
to
use
their
talents
for
God
read
the
church
instead
of
taking
their
Christian
perspective
into
the
culture
It's
a
reversal
of
the
parable
of
the
talents
We're
creating
an
entire
generation
of
Christians
afraid
to
take
risks
with
the
talents
God
has
given
them
Jesus
knew
that
investing
the
talents
of
the
story
was
a
risk
but
the
story
He
told
was
a
call
to
do
just
that
take
risks
for
the
greater
glory
of
God
Some
are
reading
this
and
asking
But
isn't
serving
God
in
another
country
a
risk
Well
yes
and
no
There
are
some
countries
that
are
quite
simply
chock
full
of
missionaries
Maybe
there's
enough
work
for
all
of
them
but
when
you
concentrate
that
much
talent
in
one
place
it
can
stunt
the
spiritual
growth
of
those
who
the
missionaries
are
serving
There
are
many
areas
of
American
society
where
having
Christians
involved
would
help
Politics
movies
music
writing
Like
C.S
Lewis
said
the
world
doesn't
need
more
Christian
writers
it
needs
more
good
writers
who
happen
to
be
Christians
The
problem
is
we
discourage
such
risk-taking
as
a
Christian
community
Think
of
what
happens
to
Christian
recording
artists
who
release
singles
to
mainstream
radio
they
lose
fans
airplay
and
are
sometimes
removed
from
the
shelves
of
Christian
bookstores
All
for
having
the
audacity
to
try
and
take
Christian
themes
into
an
industry
in
need
of
such
a
message
Foreign
missions
are
not
the
only
way
to
serve
God
and
the
church
should
resist
the
temptation
to
put
those
who
serve
in
that
capacity
on
a
pedestal
Most
of
the
missionaries
I've
met
are
humble
sincere
people
who
aren't
seeking
approval
they
just
want
to
reach
people
with
the
message
of
Christ
If
churches
want
to
serve
their
world
they
have
to
start
at
home
There
are
professions
and
communities
here
in
the
United
States
that
need
to
hear
the
gospel
or
that
need
a
Christian
influence
The
political
world
the

Goodbye
Gunga
Dan
Dan
Rather
is
stepping
down
from
the
CBS
News
anchor
desk
after
24
years
I
know
Rather
is
a
partisan
liberal
and
he
threw
journalistic
standards
out
the
window
to
try
to
make
the
president
look
bad
but
I
can't
help
but
feel
kind
of
sorry
for
the
guy
I
think
part
of
the
reason
he
lasted
so
long
is
that
he
was
for
the
most
part
sort
of
likeable
Here
is
a
guy
who
came
from
somewhat
humble
beginnings
no
fancy
journalism
school
for
Dan
to
one
of
the
most
coveted
positions
in
journalism
One
has
to
admire
his
hard
work
and
drive
if
not
his
particular
way
of
reporting
the
news
with
extreme
bias
Of
course
any
feelings
I
may
have
about
Rather
and
his
accomplishments
don't
excuse
the
shoddy
journalism
that
I
believe
led
to
his
retirement
He
along
with
Andrew
Heyward
and
Mary
Mapes
why
the
heck
does
she
still
have
a
job
by
the
way
ruined
the
once-proud
reputation
of
CBS
News
with
their
partisan
hatchet
job
on
the
president
The
use
of
forged
documents
and
the
desire
to
hold
a
damaging
story
until
36
hours
before
the
election
should
inspire
shame
in
anyone
who
cares
about
the
profession
of
journalism
When
I
was
a
journalism
student
my
professors
would
make
a
point
of
telling
us
that
the
profession
we
were
about
to
enter
was
the
only
job
in
America
with
constitutional
protection
The
Founders
knew
a
free
press
was
essential
to
a
well-functioning
democracy
But
what
if
the
press
begins
to
abuse
its
freedom
That's
the
question
the
mainstream
media
has
forced
Americans
to
consider
The
press
has
great
power
and
with
great
power...well
if
you've
seen
Spider-Man
you
know
the
rest
The
old
guard
in
the
media
is
on
its
way
out
With
their
passing
from
the
scene
those
entering
the
profession
should
ask
themselves
what
type
of
journalists
they
want
to
become
Do
they
want
to
keep
taking
the
media
down
the
road
of
slanted
stories
and
partisan
hit
pieces
or
do
they
want
to
be
honest
brokers
of
information
American
democracy
was
not
well-served
by
the
media
this
election
season
Was
this
year
the
last
gasp
of
the
old
guard
or
a
sign
of
things
to
come

I'm
going

of
them
aren't

songs
but
they're
all
songs
I

all

Whiny
Codger
Alert
Bitter
old
commentator
Andy
Rooney
has
his
own
explanation
of
why
Bush
won
Speaking
at
Tufts
University
on
Thursday
night
CBS's
Andy
Rooney
attributed
the
motivation
behind
CBS's
hit
on
President
Bush
based
on
forged
documents
to
the
political
agenda
of
CBS
News
staffers
There's
no
question
they
wanted
to
run
it
because
it
was
negative
towards
Bush
the
Tufts
Daily's
Keith
Barry
quoted
Rooney
as
revealing
during
his
remarks
Rooney
shares
that
ideological
hostility
to
Bush
as
Barry
related
how
Rooney
also
attributed
voters
reliance
on
religion
in
the
recent
election
to
ignorance
and
said
Christian
fundamentalism
is
a
result
of
a
lack
of
education
They
haven't
been
exposed
to
what
the
world
has
to
offer
In
addition
Rooney
said
he
also
could
not
understand
how
men
who
work
with
their
hands
voted
for
George
Bush
and
again
attributing
the
phenomenon
to
a
lack
of
education."Isn't
this
great
If
you
disagree
with
the
obvious
towering
intellect
of
Andy
Rooney
you
suffer
from
a
lack
of
education
If
you're
a
Christian
same
thing
If
you're
a
Republican
working
man
or
woman
ditto
For
a
guy
who
seems
to
think
he's
so
far
above
the
rest
of
us
Rooney
is
amazingly
uncreative
in
his
explanations
for
Republican
voting
patterns
Maybe
Rooney
should
leave
his
comfortable
liberal
enclave
once
in
awhile
and
see
what
the
middle
and
south
of
his
own
country
has
to
offer
It
would
do
him
some
good
to
actually
walk
into
a
church
and
meet
some
of
the
Christians
he
so
quicky
disparages
as
uneducated
louts
I'd
be
more
than
happy
to
meet
with
him
and
invite
him
to
my
church
For
the
record
I
am
a
Christian
but
contrary
to
his
stereotype
I
have
a
Master's
degree
in
public
administration
My
wife
Also
a
Christian
Working
toward
her
Master's

nursing
We've
both
been
overseas
to
Russia
and
have
hopes
of
visiting
Europe
again
or
perhaps
taking
a
trip
to
Africa
I
have
also
visited
Mexico
and
Canada
as
well
as
at
least
30
of
the
50
states
of
this
Union
In
my
church
I
can
name
three
doctors
two
engineers
one
financial
advisor
and
a
magician
Our
pastor
lived
in
another
country
and
is
bilingual
My
circle
of
friends
includes
people
in
education
social
work
youth
ministry
and
other
social
service
organizations
When
Rooney
portrays
us
as
uneducated
he's
showing
his
own
ignorance
and
giving
us
yet
another
reason
to
avoid
CBS
News
Once
again
I
make
the
offer
come
see
us

2008
Race
Starts
Senator
John
McCain
visits
New
Hampshire
Because
you
know
winning
it
helped
him
so
much
in
2000
I
live
in
Maine
so
in
2000
a
friend
and
I
went
to
New
Hampshire
to
help
the
Bush
campaign
before
the
primary
It
was
cold
and
mostly
unpleasant
although
I
did
get
the
chance
to
meet
Jeff
Greenfield
and
found
him
to
be
a
genuinely
nice
guy
Of
course
McCain
won
New
Hampshire
big
and
went
on
to
lose
the
primaries
In
an
odd
foreshadowing
to
2004
the
Arizona
senator
bitterly
blamed
his
loss
on
the
religious
conservatives
of
South
Carolina
and
the
rest
of
the
south
His
concession
speech
on
the
night
of
the
South
Carolina
primary
sticks
in
my
mind
as
one
of
the
worst
political
speeches
I've
ever
seen
or
heard
The
media
loves
to
use
the
South
Carolina
primary
as
a
bat
with
which
to
beat
the
president
alleging
Bush
won
it
through
dirty
tricks
and
negative
campaigning
It
also
gives
them
a
chance
to
paint
McCain
their
hero
as
a
victim
Frankly
New
Hampshire's
weird
independence
and
mystifying
voting
patterns
have
made
it
largely
irrelevant
to
winning
the
nomination
of
a
major
party
Clinton
lost
there
in
1992
Dole
lost
there
in
1996
Bush
lost
there
in
2000
All
of
them
eventually
went
on
to
represent
their
parties
in
the
presidential
election
If
anything
New
Hampshire's
primary
provides
a
boot
camp
of
sorts
for
the
candidates
The
cold
weather
demanding
schedules
and
politically-minded
voters
are
a
challenge
that
only
the
heartiest
and
most
prepared
can
survive
For
that
reason
alone
it
should
keep
its
place
as
the
first
primary
just
as
long
as
everyone
recognizes
its
declining
importance

a
bellwether

song
would
have
been

forgotten
The
only
modern
song
in

top

is
Smells
Like
Teen
Spirit
by
Nirvana
Now
that
the
90s
are

I
think

all
agree
that
Teen
Spirit
sucked
It
was
a
terrible
song
with
nonsensical
lyrics
sung
by
a
guy
who
really
never

have

Nirvana
was
great
when

generation
was
in
college
angry
at

parents
and
hating
our
jobs
Now
that
we're
married

working

careers
hearing
Nirvana
is
a
jolt
a
reason
to
wonder
why
the
heck
we
ever
liked
that
stuff
I
can
think
of

other

take
Nirvana's

Ghost
by

lyrically

musically
Where
the

In
Your

overplayed

still

Jann
Wenner
is
something
of
a
joke
He's
what

a

pork
more

it

In

it's
a

version

West

Someday
there
will
be
a
book

about
how
a
man
from
a
small
town
in
Maine
consolidated
power
as
speaker
and
basically
ran
the
state
of
Maine
for
years
It
was
a
petty
scandal
that
brought
Martin
down
and
distaste
for
his
actions
is
what
caused
Maine
voters
to
pass
a
term
limits
referendum
He's
only
in
office
again
because
the
Maine
term
limits
law
allows
people
to
serve
four
terms
take
two
years
off
then
serve
again
Maine's
Democrats
were
wise
to
keep
Martin
from
a
powerful
position
in
Augusta
He
was
one
of
the
most
partisan
vindictive
and
just
plain
mean
speakers
in
Maine's
history
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
he
would
have
been
any
different
as
senate
president
Governor
John
Baldacci
must
be
breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
at
this
as
the
humbling
of
Martin
means
he
can
keep
running
the
state

The
Target
Kefuffle
Many
in
the
blogsophere
are
angry
at
Target
for
their
policy
of
denying
the
Salvation
Army
the
chance
to
place
the
holiday
kettles
in
front
of
the
stores
I
wrote
a
post
on
the
subject
earlier
this
month
James
Lileks
has
a
good
answer
and
some
perspective
on
the
debate
in
today's
Bleat
At
the
center
of
this
debate
is
the
question
of
local
funding
versus
national
funding
There
are
some
national
chains
who
fund
local
charities
and
some
that
fund
only
national
organizations
People
tend
to
look
more
kindly
on
those
businesses
that
allocate
some
funds
locally
In
my
real
job
I
work
as
a
marketing/public
relations/development
manager
Much
of
my
time
is
spent
soliciting
donations
or
writing
grants
I've
seen
and
have
been
frustrated
at
times
by
the
local
versus
national
giving
guidelines
at
many
companies
People
in
the
Salvation
Army
debate
are
lionizing
a
large
national
corporation
based
in
Arkansas
for
allowing
the
Army
to
place
kettles
in
front
of
stores
saying
it
shows
the
generosity
of
that
corporation
In
reality
the
retailer
in
question
puts
most
of
its
money
into
the
Children's
Miracle
Network
and
rations
time
for
the
Salvation
Army
squeezing
them
in
beside
local
sports
teams
and
other
charities
Although
they're
allowing
the
Salvation
Army
to
solicit
they
are
limiting
the
time
given
and
putting
the
charity
on
the
same
playing
field
as
kids
wanting
to
travel
for
their
soccer
team
For
the
record
I've
found
the
Salvation
Army
much
less
confrontational
than
the
teenagers
who
ask
customers
entering
the
store
whether
they'd
like
to
donate
Such
an
approach
may
work
but
it's
annoying
and
I
don't
feel
like
being
accosted
when
entering
a
store
The
Salvation
Army
doesn't
do
that
it
just
puts
the
kettle
out
there
and
lets
customers
make
that
decision
Given
that
this
time
of
year
is
the
Salvation
Army's
big
fundraising
push
I
think
they
should
be
given
priority
over
other
charities
As
Lileks
says
though
if
you
make
your
shopping
decisions
based
on
that
corporation's
generosity
in
other
areas
you
could
go
crazy
If
I
choose
not
to
shop
at
Target
I
will
be
hurting
St
Jude's
Children's
Museum
Personally
I
don't
tend
to
make
my
shopping
decisions
based
on
what
that
corporation
does
outside
of
the
store
I
once
worked
at
the
Arkasas-based
retailer
and
found
it
to
be
an
awful
place
to
work
When
I
go
into
the
store
now
I
find
it
crowded
understaffed
and
messy
It's
an
unpleasant
place
to
shop
Target
for
now
is
cleaner
and
less
crowded
partially
because
the
designers
seem
to
understand
how
to
physically
put
a
store
together
The
aisles
are
wider
and
less
crowded
making
it
feel
as
though
there
are
fewer
people
shopping
at
any
given
time
Of
course
the
store
is
new
to
the
area
so
this
could
change
rather
quickly
once
they've
been
here
awhile
If
so
I'll
change
my
shopping
habits
accordingly
I
still
think
Target
for
PR
and
community-relations
reasons
should
change
its
policy
on
the
Salvation
Army
It's
a
stupid
policy
that
hurts
them
more
than
it
helps
In
the
end
though
if
you
want
to
give
to
the
Salvation
Army
there
are
other
ways
to
do
it
I
know
this
is
a
slight
change
from
the
stridency
of
my
first
post
on
the
subject
but
I
just
felt
some
context
and
moderation
was
necessary

she
turned
the

from

agency
that

a

The

alleged

Here

Go
Again
The
Green
Party
is
demanding
a
recount
in
Ohio
MoveOn.org
is
trying
to
raise
money
for
an
investigation
of
potential
voting
irregularities
The
pinheads
at
Democratic
Underground
and
Keith
Olbermann
of
MSNBC
have
been
screeching
that
the
election
was
stolen
and
alleging
massive
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
Republicans
The
president
really
has
nothing
to
worry
about
if
the
Democrats
couldn't
overcome
a
537
vote
lead
in
2000
they
aren't
going
to
overcome
a
130,000
vote
lead
now
In
fact
I
think
the
Democrats
have
more
to
lose
if
this
goes
forward
and
have
no
one
to
blame
if
they
somehow
get
affiliated
with
this
and
get
a
reputation
for
being
sore
losers
If
I
were
Terry
MacAuliffe
I
would
make
a
statement
explicitly
separating
myself
from
the
actions
of
MoveOn
and
the
Greens
If
his
party
is
seen
as
contesting
two
presidential
elections
including
one
where
the
winner
has
3.5
million
more
votes
than
the
loser
it
will
provide
fodder
for
years
of
Republican
advertisements
Personally
I
don't
think
MacAuliffe
has
this
degree
of
political
courage
Otherwise
he
would
have
disassociated
himself
from
the
haters
of
MoveOn
months
ago
and
told
Michael
Moore
off
at
the
same
time
But
he
didn't
and
neither
did
John
Kerry
Now
they
are
going
to
reap
the
benefits
of
that
association
Good
luck
explaining
another
recount
to
the
American
people
51

Too
Much
Self-Esteem
Curriculum
Last
night
performer
Kayne
West
was
nominated
for
three
American
Music
Awards
and
lost
Disappointing
yes
but
hardly
worthy
of
this
reaction
Backstage
West
vented
his
disappointment
over
being
shut
out
in
all
of
his
three
nominations
I
feel
I
was
definitely
robbed...I
was
the
best
new
artist
this
year
West
said
I
don't
know
if
I'll
be
back
at
this
award
show
next
year."The
mental
image
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
of
a
kid
who
doesn't
get
what
he
wants
throwing
a
tantrum
complete
with
stomped
feet
and
cries
of
I
don't
want
to
play
with
you
guys
anymore
It
seems
the
concept
of
gracious
loss
doesn't
compute
with
Mr
West
Most
performers
when
they
lose
at
one
of
these
stupid
events
talk
about
what
an
honor
it
was
to
be
nominated
and
compliment
the
winners
Even
if
the
comments
are
delivered
through
gritted
teeth
it's
still
the
polite
and
gracious
thing
to
do
After
all
thousands
of
young
artists
don't
make
it
as
far
as
Mr
West
or
his
contemporaries
Instead
we
get
this
explosion
of
hypercharged
self-esteem
I
was
the
best
new
artist
this
year
Next
thing
you
know
Mr
West
will
be
demanding
a
recount
and
talking
about
how
the
Diebold
voting
machines
were
rigged
for
Ms
Wilson
From
what
I've
read
Mr
West
is
talented
at
his
chosen
profession
but
if
he
doesn't
improve
his
public
persona
all
that
talent
may
be
for
naught
One
can
only
hope
that
he's
attempting
to
burnish
his
bad
boy
image
to
better
sell
his
product
Because
if
he's
not
then
we're
forced
to
conclude
that
Mr
West
may
just
be
a
sore
loser
and
something
of
a
whiner

Extent
of
a
Victory
This
weekend
I
was
flipping
around
the
channels
on
cable
and
came
across
something
that
looked
political
on
MTV
It
turned
out
to
be
a
marketing
campaign
to
promote
the
new
album
by
Eminem
It
was
actually
rather
clever
Instead
of
the
usual
package
of
interviews
video
clips
and
screaming
teenagers
the
new
promotion
was
made
to
look
like
a
political
convention
As
I
watched
P
Diddy
introduced
a
new
song
by
Eminem
who
took
the
stage
and
performed
his
anti-Bush
rap
Mosh
Some
of
the
audience
members
were
mouthing
along
with
the
words
and
others
were
looking
at
Mr
Mathers
with
a
rapt
adoration
Driving
to
work
this
morning
I
heard
a
news
report
about
people
leaving
or
being
fired
from
the
CIA
People
in
that
organization
were
responsible
for
many
of
the
negative
stories
and
books
about
the
president
in
the
months
leading
up
to
the
election
At
that
moment
I
realized
just
how
large
a
victory
we
won
on
November
2
The
news
and
entertainment
media
the
imbedded
civil
service
corps
the
international
community
were
all
actively
working
to
defeat
the
president
of
the
United
States
We
were
bombarded
with
anti-Bush
books
movies
songs
news
reports
etc
and
the
president
still
won
This
was
more
than
a
political
victory
It
was
the
public
giving
the
elites
a
simple
message
shut
up
We
don't
want
you
telling
us
what
to
think
Whether
the
elites
will
get
the
message
still
remains
to
be
seen

Kerry's
Failed
Dream
The
Boston
Globe
has
a
long
well-written
article
about
Kerry's
presidential
campaign
today
The
article
confirms
what
I
suspected
from

about
Senator
Kerry
and
the
Democrat
party
They
had
no
ideas
in
this
campaign
only
a
disdain
for
the
president
The
campaign
seems
to
have
spent
much
of
its

fighting
with
itself
and
reacting
to
the

of
the

Like

about

this

Never
Surrender
The
Democrats
in
discussion
boards
and
on
the
major
networks
refuse
to
give
up
the
idea
that
John
Kerry
and
John
Edwards
lost
the
election
Keith
Olbermann
especially
is
pounding
away
at
the
non-story
of
voting
irregularities
and
fraud
None
of
the
Democrat
leadership
is
going
anywhere
near
this
story
as
they
know
who
perpetuates
most
of
the
election
fraud
in
this
country
Personally
I
don't
think
Olbermann
and
his
tinfoil
hat
brigade
want
John
Kerry
to
be
president
All
they
want
is
to
create
the
whiff
of
illegitmacy
to
taint
the
second
term
of
Bush's
presidency
They
care
more
about
power
than
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process
or
people's
trust
in
it
Denied
a
Florida
2000
scenario
they
are
trying
desperately
to
create
one
from
whole
cloth
If
it
weren't
so
serious
the
attempts
would
seem
almost
comical
Actually
you
know
what
It's
still
pretty
darn
comical
Imagine
the
misguided
optimism
that
has
to
drive
someone
to
believe
a
130,000
vote
margin
in
Ohio
a
300,000
vote
margin
in
Florida
and
a
3,500,000
vote
margin
nationwide
can
be
overcome
with
some
good
PR
and
a
few
lawyers
What
we're
seeing
is
the
angry
left
counting
on
a
close
election
getting
fired
up
for
a
protracted
recount
and
then
having
their
fun
taken
away
by
the
voters
It's
definitely
the
fringe
I
heard
James
Carville
on
the
radio
this
morning
saying
they'd
been
beat
and
commending
Karl
Rove
I
think
they
should
keep
these
investigations
up
and
keep
the
fires
burning
Maybe
even
get
a
few
more
stories
into
the
mainstream
media
who
to
their
credit
are
treating
the
cries
of
the
angry
left
as
a
bunch
of
conspiracy
theories
I
want
the
sore
loser
taint
to
cling
to
the
Democrats
all
the
way
through
2008
when
we
can
tromp
them
again
It
was
the
ghosts
of
Florida
that
helped
Dems
lose
in
2002
and
this
year
Maybe
we
can
keep
that
boogeyman
alive
and
keep
winning
elections
As
long
as
Democrats
keep
looking
over
their
shoulders
at
the
past
they'll
keep
tripping
over
the
struggles
of
the

losing

nothing

calling

occupiers

Tell

Franklin

led
an

of
liberators
not

Tell

Peninsula
that

Dwight

commanded
an

Tell

a
billion
men
women

children
who
are

today
from

Never

they

For
it

been

the

not

us
the
freedom

It

So
Much
for
Hope
The
media
is
responding
to
the
death
of
Yasser
Arafat
pretty
much
just
as
it
would
the
death
of
anyone
else
The
Washington
Post
story
on
Arafat's
death
has
a
disgusting
headline
A
Dreamer
Who
Forced
His
Cause
Onto
World
Stage
This
is
true
if
forced
is
defined
to
include
the
murder
of
innocents
and
the
use
of
terrorism
as
a
weapon
against
a
stronger
foe
My
earlier
bout
of
sensitivity
about
this
issue
is
gone
and
I'm
glad
Arafat
is
dead
The
man
showed
just
how
thoroughly
one
can
squander
the
gift
of
life
by
using
his
power
to
take
it
from
others
I'm
not
feeling
particularly
well
this
morning
so
I
didn't
have
the
ability
to
make
it
through
the
rest
of
the
wretched
WaPo
article
A
man
who
should
be
denounced
is
being
praised
given
the
hero
treatment
for
the
work
he
did
on
behalf
of
the
Palestinian
people
Jonah
Goldberg's
response
to
the
life
and
treatment
of
Arafat
fits
my
thoughts
exactly
Given
their
shameful
performance
during
the
presidential
election
one
would
think
the
media
would
reconsider
its
ways
Obviously
it
has
not
The
same
people
who
spent
a
year
demonizing
President
Bush
now
lionize
Yasser
Arafat
Maybe
we've
finally
found
the
explanation
for
media
bias
It's
not
partisanship
it's
a
lack
of
discernment
or
basic
values
Just
when
I
thought
the
media
couldn't
possibly
get
worse
it
proves
me
wrong

Limiting
the
Army
A
major
from
the
local
Salvation
Army
was
on
the
radio
this
morning
and
said
many
stores
in
Bangor
had
limited
the
time
that
bell-ringers
could
solicit
for
funds
outside
stores
At
most
stores
bell-ringers
will
only
be
allowed
to
put
out
the
kettle
for
two
weeks
This
could
cost
the
Salvation
Army
about
20,000
in
donations
To
be
fair
to
the
local
stores
most
of
the
decisions
are
made
at
the
corporate
level
and
some
store
managers
are
just
as
unhappy
with
the
decision
as
the
Salvation
Army
The
major
didn't
want
to
disclose
which
stores
had
limited
the
Army's
access
to
their
doors
but
from
what
I
can
tell
Wal-Mart
Sam's
Club
and
Target
are
among
the
offending
corporations
Their
rationale
is
that
if
they
allow
the
Salvation
Army
to
solicit
every
non-profit
in
the
area
will
be
forced
to
have
equal
access
to
the
prime
solitication
spot
Nonsense
The
Salvation
Army
provides
food
clothing
and
other
necessities
to
those
who
cannot
afford
them
They
are
an
organization
dedicated
to
helping
others
and
do
so
with
minimal
administrative
costs
The
bell-ringing
campaign
is
the
major
fundraiser
for
the
Army
and
a
familiar
part
of
holiday
shopping
Stores
are
private
corporations
and
should
have
the
right
to
do
what
they
want
with
their
property
but
at
the
same
time
customers
who
feel
strongly
should
communicate
their
displeasure
with
these
businesses
and
ask
that
the
Salvation
Army
be
given
the
opportunity
to
continue
raising
funds
At
the
very
least
they
should
be
shamed
into
helping
make
up
the
difference
between
what
the
Army
was
able
to
raise
last
year
and
what
it
will
raise
this
year
under
the
current
restrictions
If
you
want
to
help
the
Salvation
Army
visit
them
at
NetKettle.com
and
donate
online
Also
call
Wal-Mart
Sam's
Club
and
Target
and
let
them
know
their
corporate
policy
is
wrongheaded
and
they
should
allow
the
red
kettles
to
once
again
grace
the
front
doors

seem
craven
and
I
cannot
quite
bring
myself
to
celebrate
any
death
even
that
of
one
who
so
richly
deserves
it
The
best
thing
that
could
be
said
of
Arafat
is
that
even
the
Palestinian
people
deserved
better
I
have
little
sympathy
for
a
people
who
followed
such
a
man
and
murdered
innocents
at
his
command
but
Arafat
used
them
whenever
it
suited
his
will
to
power
I
hope
that
when
Arafat
passes
the
people
of
the
West
Bank
will
find
the
strength
to
rebel
against
the
mindset
that
Arafat
represented
and
demand
a
new
birth
of
freedom
for
themselves
Decades
of
terrorist
action
against
their
Jewish
neighbors
has
brought
them
poverty
war
and
suffering
Perhaps
the
death
of
the
man
most
responsible
for
their
plight
will
serve
as
a
wake-up
call
When
Arafat
does
die
I
hope
the
media
restrains
itself
and
doesn't
give
us
a
sympathetic
portrait
reserved
for
world
leaders
Arafat's
life
is
not
one
that
should
be
commended
and
the
world
should
be
ashamed
that
it
tolerated

Secessionitis

The
Civil

Ken
Burns
amazing
look
at
the
War
Between
the

and
the

that
fought
it
Burns
uses
President

words
in
one
episode
to
describe
the
feeling
of
secessionitis
that
blazed
through
the
South
just
before
the
war
began
A
similar
feeling
seems
to
be
infecting
prominent
liberal
writers
following
the
election
of
George
W
Bush
It's
obvious
that
despite
the
fervent
wishes
of
a
few
nuts
the
so-called
blue
states
are
not
going
to
secede
from
the
Union
It's
been
tried
once
and
it
failed
miserably
The
talk
of
secession
is
just
a
way
for
disgruntled
liberals
to
vent
about
the
election
Still
though
the
idea
has
a
certain
amount
of
interest
from
a
purely
alternate
history
point
of
view
Imagine
if
say
Oregon
or
Michigan
decided
it
wanted
out
and
the
legislature
of
one
of
those
states
decided
to
vote
itself
out
of
the
United
States
What
would
the
president
do
What
would
be
the
appropriate
response
There
is
certainly
a
legal
precedent
for
the
president
to
take
military
action
against
rebellious
states

his
show
online
right
now
and
he's
dissing
Halo
as
a
waste
of
time
that
leads
to
lowered
American
productivity
He's
debating
Lileks
about
the
issue
right

Of

just
showed
his
ignorance
of
the
issue
by
asking
whether
it
was
possible
to
play
as

Flood

Sigh
I
personally
enjoy
Halo
and
don't
necessarily
think
video
games
are
detrimental
to
the
health
of
the
Republic
I
play
Halo
Splinter

Star

Knights

others
The

sociopath
in

enjoys
the
Grand
Theft
Auto
games
as
they
allow
one
to
do
things
like
steal
cars
without
the
messy
social
and
legal
implications
Video
games
have
always
provided
me
the
opportunity
to
relax
immerse
myself
in
another
world
and
forget
what's
going
on
in
the
real
world
I'm
on
both
sides
of
this
issue
Games
like
Halo
are
fun
but
shouldn't
be
a
substitute
for
actual
contact
with
other
human
beings
Now
I
think
Hewitt
and
Lileks
should
go
at
each
other

Slayer

Advice
for
Democrats
Many
conservative
bloggers
are
giving
advice
to
the
Democrats
I've
spent
some
time
today
catching
up
on
my
reading
and
have
been
amazed
at
the
behavior
of
some
Democrats
It's
normal
for
a
party
who
just
lost
an
election
to
engage
in
some
introspection
or
even
anger
Today's
Democrats
seem
to
be
focusing
almost
entirely
on
the
anger
They
are
lashing
out
at
the
electorate
insulting
the
nearly
60
million
of
us
who
voted
for
the
president
and
in
some
cases
claiming
fraud
and
renewing
Al
Gore's
calls
of
a
stolen
election
This
will
not
help
them
in
2006
or
2008
If
this
election
has
shown
us
anything
it's
that
anger
is
not
enough
to
propel
someone
into
the
White
House
With
that
in
mind
here
are
a
few
things
Democrats
should
do
to
remain
competitive
in
national
elections
1
Admit
you
lost
Ignore
the
rabid
hyperventilating
of
Keith
Olbermann
and
those
who
insist
the
election
was
stolen
by
Chimpy
Bushlitler
and
his
Mindless
Christian
Soldiers
of
Doom
Bush
received
more
votes
to
win
Ohio
than
Kerry
got
to
win
Pennsylvania
and
there
was
some
evidence
of
wrongdoing
in
the
city
of
Philadelphia
and
definate
shenanigans
by
Penn's
Democrat
Governor
Despite
that
you
don't
see
Republicans
huddling
in
internet
chatrooms
sharing
conspiracy
theories
like
valuable
baseball
cards
The
only
thing
worse
than
a
sore
loser
is
someone
who
can't
admit
he
lost
fairly
which
you
did
2
Get
Rid
of
Moore
and
Hollywood
Michael
Medved
has
a
good
column
today
in
the
Wall
Street
Journal
about
how
Hollywood
helped
Kerry
lose
the
election
The
entertainment
elites
and
the
odious
Moore
poured
millions
of
dollars
into
the
effort
to
defeat
Bush
and
lost
Moore's
film
Fahrenheit
9/11
was
used
to
great
effect
as
a
tool
to
demoralize
American
soldiers
in
a
combat
zone
and
was
quoted
by
Osama
bin
Laden
Moore's
film
was
quite
simply
a
hate
Bush
film
The
filmmaker
wanted
everyone
who
watched
the
film
to
come
out
of
the
theater
hating
the
president
as
much
as
he
does
For
audiences
predisposed
toward
anti-Bush
sentiments
it
worked
For
everyone
else
it
did
not
Ditch
the
loser
3
Tell
MoveOn.org
to
Move
On
MoveOn.org
is
one
of
the
most
highly
publicized
political
organizations
in
recent
memory
It
has
gotten
huge
amounts
of
generally
good
press
Unfortunately
for
you
that
good
press
did
not
help
the
organization's
efficacy
in
actually
winning
elections
MoveOn
gave
Al
Gore
a
platform
to
unleash
his
new
lunacy
on
the
American
people
giving
thousands
of
voters
a
reason
to
thank
God
and
the
voters
of
Florida
that
the
former
vice
president
didn't
reach
the
White
House
One
of
the
great
unreported
stories
of
this
election
was
the
thuggish
behavior
of
many
MoveOn
volunteers
at
polling
places
National
Review's
Corner
and
Battlegrounders
chronicled
heckling
and
electioneering
going
on
at
polling
places
started
by
MoveOn
troops
These
guys
did
you
no
good
and
their
create
an
ad
competition
with
the
multitude
of
Bush
as
Hitler
ads
may
have
done
the
party
some
harm
Next
time
they
offer
to
help
say
no
4
Unions
Don't
Help
Get
Volunteers
Instead
The
Republican
ground
operation
which
helped
Bush
win
the
election
was
run
entirely
by
volunteers
The
Democrat
GOTV
effort
was
run
by
paid
staff
and
unions
We
know
now
which
operation
was
more
successful
in
getting
people
to
the
polls
Unions
have
gone
from
being
heroic
protectors
of
the
working
man
to
political
organizations
that
sometimes
help
workers
The
AFL-CIO
coordinated
a
nationwide
series
of
protests
at
Bush-Cheney
offices
that
resulted
in
injury
and
destruction
of
property
at
some
locations
People
in
unions
should
realize
for
the
most
part
union
leaders
don't
care
about
you
and
are
simply
using
you
to
get
political
power
When
was
the
last
time
a
Democratic
politician
actually
did
anything
to
help
the
working
man
Sure
the
rhetoric
about
taxing
the
rich
sounds
great
but
did
it
lower
your
taxes
at
all
Soaking
the
guys
who
make
more
money
than
you
may
make
you
feel
better
but
did
it
actually
improve
your
quality
of
life
at
all
Think
about
that
5
Don't
Ignore
Religious
Voters
But
Don't
Pander
to
Us
Either
It's
okay
for
you
to
be
secularists
Really
it
is
Not
everyone
has
to
believe
in
God
and
faith
should
not
be
a
litmus
test
to
elected
office
It
would
be
great
though
if
those
running
for
office
acknowledged
that
some
of
us
do
believe
in
God
and
our
faith
is
more
than
just
an
excuse
to
hate
gays
and
keep
women
from
abortion
clinics
Insulting
people
of
faith
is
no
way
to
win
friends
and
influence
people
to
vote
for
you
Respecting
our
right
to
believe
what
we
want
while
disagreeing
on
goals
is
perfectly
okay
I
would
rather
have
a
politician
be
honest
about
his
or
her
disagreements
with
those
of
faith
than
have
someone
pretend
to
be
a
person
of
faith
Scripture
says
that
God
isn't
mocked
His
followers
shouldn't
be
either
6
Get
Rid
of
Moore
Seriously
He's
poison
7
We
Can
Be
Influenced
Don't
Force
Things
Down
Our
Throats
Personally
I
have
no
problem
with
the
idea
of
civil
unions
for
gays
and
lesbians
I
was
still
angry
at
the
actions
of
the
Massachusetts
Supreme
Court
and
San
Francisco
Mayor
Gavin
Newsome
A
massive
change
to
society
should
not
be
forced
by
the
ruling
of
a
court
or
the
will
of
a
single
man
Let's
have
a
debate
about
the
issue
Forcing
it
on
people
probably
set
the
cause
of
gay
marriage
and/or
civil
unions
back
a
decade
or
so
Persuade
don't
dictate
8
Get
Serious
About
National
Security
One
of
the
worst
things
John
Kerry
did
was
politicize
the
war
on
terrorism
Despite
the
wishes
of
anti-war
types
there
are
people
in
the
world
who
want
to
kill
us
They
cannot
be
reasoned
with
or
appeased
They
have
to
be
imprisoned
or
otherwise
silenced
Most
Americans
know
this
and
it's
much
of
the
reason
Kerry
lost
Listen
to
Lieberman
He's
a
pretty
smart
guy
9
Tell
the
UN
to
Shove
It
Kerry
probably
lost
millions
of
votes
when
he
promised
his
first
act
as
president
would
be
to
go
to
the
United
Nations
and
basically
apologize
for
U.S
action
We
don't
like
or
respect
the
United
Nations
and
your
adoration
of
them
isn't
very
attractive
It's
time
to
admit
the
UN
is
a
deeply
flawed
and
corrupt
organization
that
impedes
rather
than
assists
progress
The
organization
has
refused
to
stop
genocide
called
the
liberation
of
Iraqis
illegal
and
stolen
billions
of
dollars
from
poor
people
What's
it
going
to
take
for
you
to
admit
these
guys
are
no
good
If
a
nationally
prominent
Democrat
say
from
Massachusetts
were
to
call
for
a
full
investigation
of
the
United
Nations
and
question
whether
the
organization
needed
reform
it
could
serve
as
a
wake-up
call
to
the
gang
of
thugs
in
New
York
10
One
last
time
Moore
is
a
bad
man
Make
him
unwelcome
That's
some
advice
anyway
from
a
former
split-ticket
voter
who
plans
to
be
as
partisan
as
possible
until
the
Dems
pull
out
of
the
self-destructive
spiral
in
which
they
are
now
engaged

Bush
Hatred
Continues
I'll
admit
I
was
wrong
I
completely
expected
the
intense
Bush
hatred
that
exists
within
the
Democrat
party
to
dwindle
after
Bush
won
re-election
Unfortunately
it
seems
the
hating
has
just
begun
I
can't
say
that
I'm
surprised
at
what
Garrison
Keillor
said
but
I
am
disappointed
that
a
government-funded
radio
network
would
run
what
amounts
to
anti-Christian
bigotry
Would
they
be
so
blase
if
Keillor
were
joking
about
taking
away
the
vote
from
African-Americans
In
the
attempt
to
find
a
scapegoat
for
their
election
defeat
Democrats
seem
to
be
settling
on
a
narrative
that
blames
born
again
voters
who
hate
the
idea
of
gay
marriage
Such
a
narrative
may
appeal
to
the
fragile
egos
in
the
Democrat
leadership
but
it
runs
the
risk
of
alienating
large
segments
of
the
population
who
do
believe
in
God
and
go
to
church
each
Sunday
There
already
exists
a
disconnect
between
religious
voters
and
the
Democrat
party
Comments
by
Democrat
strategists
and
radio
personalities
insulting
those
voters
will
do
the

no

Healing
the
Divide
Both
candidates
gave
wonderful
speeches
yesterday
I
thought
John
Kerry's
and
George
W
Bush's
words
were
humble
graceful
and
a
good
way
to
end
this
bitter
election
season
It's
too
bad
that
members
of
Senator
Kerry's
party
didn't
get
the
memo
On
Fox
News
John
Gibson
was
interviewing
Bob
Beckel
a
Democrat
strategist
The
guy
was
a
complete
jerk
He
said
President
Bush
had
no
mandate
and
that
Democrats
should
fight
his
agenda
every
step
of
the
way
Other
Democrats
have
been
more
concilatory
in
tone
but
have
similar
messages
to
that
of
Mr
Beckel
Having
lost
the
election
badly
the
Democrats
now
believe
the
best
way
to
heal
the
country
is
for
President
Bush
to
pass
Democrat
legislation
and
appoint
liberal
judges
Any
other
actions
would
be
partisanship
of
the
worst
order
President
Bush
should
for
the
most
part
ignore
them
As
the
first
president
in
16
years
to
win
a
majority
in
the
popular
vote
and
a
strong
showing
in
the
electoral
college
President
Bush
has
a
mandate
to
lead
People
knew
what
they
were
voting
for
and
expect
him
to
do
the
things
he
promised
during
the
campaign
Democrats
have
to
realize
that
if
people
wanted
liberal
policy
they
would
have
elected
John
Kerry
and
given
the
Democrats
control
of
the
Senate
Obviously
that
didn't
happen
The
Democrats
still
haven't
gotten
the
message
that
they
lost
People
don't
like
their
ideas
and
don't
want
them
running
the
country
It's
a
hard
realization
to
make
but
the
results
from
Tuesday
send
a
strong
message
It's
time
for
the
Dems
to
start
listening
to
what
the
people
are
telling
them
or
continue
having
bad
nights

The
Future
of
Bush
Hatred
I
work
in
a
predominantly
liberal
workplace
This
morning
my
co-workers
were
understandably
glum
about
the
election
results
A
common
theme
ran
through
the
comments
I
heard
I
don't
know
how
we'll
survive
another
four
years
My
co-workers
seemed
to
believe
that
Bush
was
going
to
make
it
part
of
his
nefarious
agenda
to
kill
more
kids
in
Iraq
cut
all
social
spending
and
maybe
kick
a
puppy
or
two
for
fun
Okay
I
made
that
last
part
up
As
I
said
earlier
this
morning
the
Democrats
have
a
real
problem
in
the
Angry
Left
the
Anybody
But
Bush
crowd
the
MoveOn.org
types
This
constituency
may
have
helped
cost
them
the
election
by
giving
social
conservatives
a
reason
to
go
to
the
polls
yesterday
The
thought
of
having
Michael
Moore
sitting
at
the
inauguration
of
a
President
John
Kerry
was
a
hideous
enough
thought
to
most
Republicans
and
probably
helped
fuel
yesterday's
huge
turnout
Some
Democrats
may
be
tempted
to
placate
the
Angry
Left
and
maybe
emulate
them
to
build
a
liberal
majority
in
the
United
States
That
would
be
a
mistake
If
this
were
as
liberal
a
country
as
Michael
Moore
likes
to
pretend
Bush
never
would
have
received
3
million
more
votes
than
Kerry
Die-hard
liberals
make
up
a
minority
of
this
country
as
do
truly
rabid
conservatives
Unfortunately
for
the
Democrats
the
fringe
of
the
party
took
over
this
year
They
would
be
wise
to
excise
them
A
good
start
would
be
to
remove
Terry
McAuliffe
from
the
leadership
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee
The
man
is
a
failure
and
a
barrier
to
civil
political
discourse
The
insanity
and
venom
that
flows
from
McAuliffe's
lips
has
helped
the
Dems
lose
three
straight
election
cycles
2000
2002
and
this
year
McAuliffe
emboldens
and
encourages
the
fringes
and
has
no
idea
how
to
build
a
winning
or
reasonable
political
party
Another
step
would
be
for
Democrats
to
disassociate
themselves
from
Michael
Moore
and
MoveOn.org
The
odious
filmmaker
has
slandered
America's
soldiers
and
emboldened
our
enemies
with
his
vile
propaganda
His
brand
of
politics
is
based
on
lies
and
a
man
such
as
he
has
no
place
in
the
public
square
Same
with
MoveOn.org
Their
contribution
to
America
has
been
a
return
of
the
politics
of
thuggishness
Anecdotal
stories
from
yesterday's
voting
suggests
MoveOn.org
volunteers
were
causing
problems
with
voters
Finally
Democrats
need
to
gain
some
perspective
The
re-election
of
Bush
is
not
analogous
to
the
ascension
of
Hitler
as
one
of
my
co-workers
suggested
It's
simply
another
American
election
which
went
to
the
political
party
currently
in
power
Bush
does
not
want
to
kill
your
children
in
Iraq
or
cut
all
benefits
to
those
in
need
Bush
has
no
master
plan
to
take
away
the
civil
liberties
of
Americans
or
form
a
dictatorship
There
are
no
vast
conspiracies
involving
Halliburton
and
rich
donors
George
W
Bush
is
simply
a
man
who
a
vast
majority
of
Americans
have
picked
to
lead
this
country
In
four
years
the
country
will
still
be
here
and
we'll
pick
another
citizen
from
our
ranks
to
do
the
same
job
The
hyperventilating
on
the
left
over
this
election
is
largely
a
result
of
their
own
fevered
imaginations
and
the
need
they
have
to
create
a
villain
deserving
of
the
intense
hatred
they
feel
for
the
president
The
fact
that
the
president
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
caricature
they
have
constructed
reveals
a
weakness
in
the
character
of
those
who
hate
not
in
the

Winners
and
Losers
It's
all
over
but
the
whining
Bush
will
take
Ohio
and
its
20
electoral
votes
to
win
the
election
This
has
been
a
long
revealing
election
season
and
there
are
some
definite
winners
and
losers
The
first
winner
is
obvious
President
Bush
and
the
GOP
He
did
it
Not
only
did
he
win
decisively
in
the
EC
but
he
pulled
off
a
nearly
4-million
popular
vote
win
This
despite
years
of
pure
hatred
directed
at
him
by
the
media
entertainment
and
political
spheres
Congratulations
Mr
President
Hugh
Hewitt
Powerline
has
written
a
complimentary
post
about
Hugh
and
the
hard
work
he
did
in
this
election
season
He
was
cheerleader
policy
wonk
and
stern
taskmaster
all
at
once
and
he
deserves
credit
for
rallying
the
troops
Swift
Boat
Vets
for
Truth
Derided
by
the
media
slimed
by
the
Kerry
campaign
and
the
Democrats
these
old
soldiers
didn't
give
up
and
gave
better
than
they
got
In
August
when
Kerry
was
beginning
to
build
momentum
against
the
president
these
guys
came
out
and
planted
doubts
in
voters
minds
about
the
senator
from
Massachusetts
One
of
the
vets
has
been
quoted
as
saying
a
Kerry
defeat
will
be
the
welcome
home
parade

never
had
Enjoy

celebration

Duh
The

These
guys
acted
as

to

major

especially
CBS

them

Were
it
not
for
the
internet
brigade
the
media
would
have
gotten
away
with
their
false
attacks
against
the
president
and
influenced
the
election
Times
have
definitely
changed.Now
to
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
Those
who
have
diminished
in
stature
this
election
seasons
and
win
the
Slublog
designation
of
loser
yeah
like
this'll
break
their
hearts
MSM
The
mainstream
media
blew
it
and
it
has
cost
them
Their
guy
John
Kerry
lost
the
election
despite
having
an
unprecedented
amount
of
positive
coverage
The
media
ignored
good
news
in
Iraq
elections
in
Afghanistan
talked
down
the
economy
used
fake
documents
and
questionable
sources
in
anti-Bush
stories
and
generally
made
complete
horse's
asses
of
themselves
The
effects
are
already
apparent
declining
circulation
and
ratings
and
a
general
sense
by
the
American
people
that
the
media
just
can't
be
trusted
CBS
and
the
New
York
Times
are
worse
offenders
than
most
and
deserve
every
cancelled
paper
and
advertiser
they
get
John
Kerry
This
guy's
a
loser
and
not
making
his
reputation
any
better
by
at
the
time
of
this
writing
9:41
a.m
EST
refusing
to
concede
the
bleedin
obvious
he
lost
the
election
The
Democrats
made
a
big
mistake
this
election
season
with
their
assumption
that
everyone
hated
Bush
as
much
as
they
did
and
choosing
a
truly
unlikable
candidate
to
carry
the
banner
If
they
had
picked
someone
the
base
could
get
enthused
about
we
may
have
had
much
different
results
Angry
Left
This
contingent
has
fair
representation
where
I
work
One
of
my
co-workers
was
saying
this
election
won't
be
good
for
the
boys
in
Iraq
but
it
will
be
great
for
rich
people
Needless
to
say
I've
tried
to
lay
low
and
mute
my
enthusiasm
which
isn't
too
hard
considering
how
tired
I
am
The
Michael
Moore/MoveOn.org/George
Soros/Democratic
Underground
left
lost
big
yesterday
and
haven't
learned
a
damn
thing
They
are
already
beginning
the
whisper
campaign
making
allegations
of
fraud
voter
intimidation
etc
The
Democrat
party
simply
cannot
afford
to
keep
pandering
to
the
angry
left
The
long-term
prospects
of
the
party
will
be
damaged
beyond
repair
if
the
Dems
keep
up
the
intensity
of
their
Bush-hatred
It's
time
for
the
party
leaders
to
dump
those
who
have
been
fostering
this
lingering
rage
and
get
to
work
creating
a
majority
party
The
loss
last
night
of
the
White
House
the
Congress
and
some
down-ticket
races
is
devastating
to
a
party
that
still
hasn't
gotten
used
to
being
out
of
power
They
should
give
up
the
victimization
act
and
start
doing
the
hard
work
necessary
to
start
winning
elections
again
Exit
Polls
and
Pollsters
I
predicted
Bush
would
win
the
EC
285
to
253
It
looks
like
he
will
win
286
to
252
I
did
that
based
on
hunches
and
the
aggregate
poll
results
I
found
on
the
web
Zogby
with
all
of
his
sophisticated
equipment
and
polling
prowess
predicted
a
311-227
Kerry
win
That's
right
I
beat
Zogby
What's

you
can't

a

The
exit
polls
and
the
resulting
media
commentary
on

day
may
have
affected
the
election
a
bit
The
exit
polls
turned
out

be
scandalously
wrong
The

should
seriously
look
at
getting
rid
of

pollsters
They

money's
worth
at

These
guys
were
wrong
wrong
wrong
and
the
media
has
egg
on
its
collective
face
because
of
it
How
about

counting

there
it
is
the
winners

are
no
Kerry

morning

arguing

Part
of
this
is
probably
because
they
are
simply
asleep

some
is
due
to
the
fact
that
Kerry

just
not

was
the

This
lack
of

for

the

silence

will
lead
to
a
Kerry

be

that

bow
out
gracefully

he
still
has
the
chance
The

should
have
conceded

decided
to

pansy

try

contest
Bush's
140,000

2008
President
Bush's
commanding
lead
in

popular
vote
gives
him
the
moral
victory
that
allowed
Al
Gore
to
contest
Florida
Bush's
margin
is
insurmountable
and
far
removed
from
the
500
or
so
votes
that
separated
him
from
Gore
in

That

George

over
50
percent

two

points

Perhaps
they

First
Exits
Don't
look
good
for
Bush
but
these
are
exit
polls
from
this
morning
they
say
Bush
is
down
anywhere
from
1
to
4
in
Florida
and
Ohio
which
he
won
in
2000
but
only
1
or
2
points
down
in
New
Mexico
Michigan
and
Iowa
all
states
Gore
won
After
I
finish
blogging
I'm
heading
back
over
to
Bush
HQ
and
making
more
phone
calls
These
early
exits
are
unreliable
so
keep

These
are

polls
and
have
a
margin
of
error

From

No

And
if

The
Media
Reckoning
The
New

Post
editorializes
on
the
sorry
state
of
reporting
that
exists
at
the
New

Times
and
CBS
News
No
matter
who
wins
tomorrow
and
it
will
be
Bush
stop
worrying
we
need
to
bring
the
media
to
account
for
their
transgressions
against
truth
and
honest
democracy
The
mainstream
media
has
done
everything
it
can
to
discredit
the
Bush
administration
and
defeat
the
president
Media
is
funded
by
advertisers
During
the
month
of
February
we
should
institute
an
idea
I've
had
since
this
summer
Shut
Up
and
Sing
Month
In
that
month
millions
of
Americans
should
refrain
from
television
newspapers
movies
music
and
everything
else
produced
by
the
celebrities
who
hate
Bush
and
the
advertisers
who
support
biased
media
outlets
One
full
month
of
lost
profits
declining
viewership
and
dropping
circulation
will
probably
accomplish
nothing
toward
making
the
media
less
biased
But
it
will
serve
to
show
them
just
how
many
of
us
are
dissatisfied
with
the
state
of
affairs
in
this
country
and
how
angry
we
all
are
over
their
blatant
partisanship
Blogs
have
already
discredited
big
media
outlets
Now
it's
time
to
give
the
entire
media
establishment
a
wake-up
call

Sigh
Woke
up
this

to
find
my
Bush/Cheney
sign
once
again
missing
Fortunately
the

simply
ripped
it
from

bent

I
straightened

back
out

only
one
more
day
The
Kerry

and
its

aren't
exactly
acting

They
are
doing
everything
they
can
to
intimidate
or
punish
Bush
voters
and
poison
the
political
well
for
years
to
come
President
Bush
is
the
most
hated
president
in
recent
history
When
he
wins
re-election
we
are
going
to
see
an
outpouring
of
rage
and
bitterness
DNC
Chairman
Terry
McAuliffe
will
be
fired
within

deservedly
so
There
has
never
been
a

Eminem's
Approval
Marshall
Mathers
the
rapper
better
known
as
Eminem
has
endorsed
the
election
of
John
Kerry
with
his
new
song
and
video
Mosh
In
doing
so
he
has
become
a
hero
of

once

After

I'm

For
What
It's
Worth
Here
is
my
prediction
of
what
the
electoral
map
will
look
like
next
Tuesday
Thanks
to
Opinion
Journal
for
providing
the
tools
necessary
for
this
map
One
clarification
though
I
think
the
final
tally
will
actually
be
Bush
285
Kerry
253
because
I
believe
Bush
will
win
Maine's
second
congressional
district
vote
I
believe
Bush
will
win
both
Florida
and
Ohio
because
evidence
suggests
the
GOTV
effort
in
those
states
is
strong
for
the
Republicans
and
motivation
for
the
Democrats
is
weak
The
fact
that
Democrats
just
don't
like
John
Kerry
could
be
a
major
factor
in
their
ability
to
turn
out
new
voters
I
also
predict
we'll
know
who
the
winner
is
by
November
3
but
John
Kerry
will
challege
the
results
in
at
least
two
states
because
his
massive
ego
just
won't
let
him
believe
he
lost
The
networks
like
last
time
will
probably
give
credence
to
any
Kerry
challenges
even
if
the
electoral
tally
is
definitive
They
will
also
be
quick
to
call
states
for
Kerry
and
slow
to
call
states
for
Bush
A
sign
to
watch
for
the
media
will
know
which
way
the
wind
is
blowing
by
mid-afternoon
If
Dan
Rather
looks
especially
ticked
and
the
others
look
glum
the
election
will
go
to
Bush
If
they
all
are
giggling
like
schoolgirls
Kerry
is
doing
well
If
Drudge
puts
up
exit
polls
like
he
did
last
year
I'll
give
them

Worn
Out
Can't
really
think
of
anything
profound
to
say
right
now
I'm
tired
of
politics
and
tired
of
the
major
media
and
the
Democrats
The
media
has
lost
its
credibility
John
Kerry
will
do
anything
to
win
John
Kerry
may
win
the
election
due
to
a
combination
of
voter
fraud
and
media
bias
If
we
cannot
depend
on
an
independent
media
and
a
fair
election
process
then
this
country
is
in
trouble
Al
Gore
is
the
most
reprehensible
political
figure
of
our
time
His
actions
in
Florida
his
refusal
to
accept
legitimate
election
results
have
helped
lead
to
the
litigious
and
angry
politics
we
are
now
seeing
The
saddest
thing
is
that
Gore
obviously
still
believes
he
was
right
and
would
do
it
again
My
only
hope
is
that
history
will
treat
him
with
the
same
contempt
that
he
showed
for
the
electoral
process
in
2000
No
matter
who
wins
on
Tuesday
and
I
do
think
it
will
be
Bush
despite
my
pessimism
the
lazy
little
sissies
in
the
Republican-controlled
Congress
should
push
for
voting
reform
Everyone
who
votes
should
have
to
show
identification
The
voting
rolls
should
be
purged
of
dead
voters
and
felons
The
system
has
to
be
fixed
The
Democrats
like
to
whine
that
such
reforms
would
lead
to
a
disenfranchisement
or
an
intimidation
of
voters
They
should
get
over
it
Everytime
a
fraudulent
vote
is
cast
a
legitimate
voter
is
disenfranchised
My
legitimate
vote
should
not
be
cancelled
out
by
a
dead
or
non-eligible
voter
Motivated
entirely
by
an
irrational
hatred
of
President
Bush
and
an
overwhelming
desire
to
regain
power
the
Democrats
have
taken
actions
that
threaten
the
system
of
government
that
has
kept
this
country
together
for
over
200
years
Even
during
the
Civil
War
when
Americans
were
killing
one
another
the
presidential
vote
was
not
challenged
threatened
or
affected
by
fraud
The
party
of
Roosevelt
and
Truman
has
become
a
hollow
shrieking
shell
whose
need
for
power
seems
to
have
overwhelmed
their
love
and
respect
for

The
Joys
of
a
Swing
State
Former
New

Mayor
Rudolph
Giuliani
in
Brewer
Maine
today
The
local
high
school
band
welcomed
Giuliani
with
what
else
New
York
New
York
The
venue
was
a
small
auditorium
which
was
great
A
few
hundred
people
attended
The
blue
curtain
on
the
right
is
the
stage
We
had
to
listen
to
a
couple
of
local
politicians
and
the
Republican
congressional
candidate
before
the
main
event
The
pictures
from
this
point
were
from
a
slight
distance
so
I
had
to
clean
them
up
a
bit
Maine's
Bush/Cheney
04
Chairman
Peter
Cianchette
welcomes
Mayor
Giuliani
to
the
stage
Right
after
the
applause
died
down
a
man
yelled
How
about
those
Red
Sox
Giuliani
congratulated
the
Sox
then
quoted
a
New
York
paper
headline
I
guess
we'll
see
you
again
in
2090
then
He
then
took
the
opportunity
to
tweak
John
Kerry's
sports
gaffes
John
Kerry
said
his
favorite
player
is
Manny
Ortez
The
crowd
laughed
Maybe
he
got
confused
Maybe
Ortez
is
the
French
pronunciation
of
Ortiz
This
comment
got
him
huge
applause
After
the
sports
talk
was
over
Giuliani
switched
to
more
serious
topics
saying
the
best
reason
to
elect
George
W
Bush
was
to
ensure
that
America
had
a
strong
leader
with
conviction
leading
us
in
a
time
of
war
When
we're
at
war
and
engaged
in
an
effort
to
defeat
people
who
want
to
kill
us
we
need
a
strong
leader
someone
who
can
stand
up
to
the
kind
of
assaults
that
take
place
during
war
Giuliani
said
John
Kerry
is
an
anti-war
candidate
He
voted
against
the
first
Gulf
War
Somehow
even
that
war
didn't
pass
his
global
test
Giuliani
then
spent
a
few
minutes
discussing
Kerry's
lack
of
a
Senate
record
suggesting
he's
been
on
the
wrong
side
of
almost
every
foreign
policy
debate
of
the
last
few
decades
Kerry
talks
about
Vietnam
then
moves
ahead
to
running
for
president
ignoring
the
24
years
in
between
he
said
Republican
congressional
candidate
Brian
Hamel
then
started
a
question
and
answer
session
reading
pre-selected
questions
from
the
crowd
The
first
was
about
the
threat
of
a
new
terrorist
attack
We
have
to
be
prepared
to
be
attacked
again
but
we
can't
let
that
frighten
us
Actually
it's
okay
to
be
frightened
but
we
can't
let
the
threat
of
attack
stop
us
from
doing
what
we
need
to
do
Giuliani
said
The
risk
is
there
and
the
president
has
made
sure
we
are
doing
everything
we
can
to
prepare
for
future
attacks
Another
question
was
about
Kerry's
recent
line
of
attack
regarding
the
missing
ammunition
in
Iraq
Giuliani
got
a
bit
intense
during
his
answer
John
Kerry
will
stop
at
nothing
He'll
make
the
worst
most
irresponsible
charges
because
he
wants
to
be
president
so
badly
he
said
He
doesn't
think
about
the
consequences
of
his
words
at
all
As
to
the
story
itself
Giuliani
began
his
answer
Well
the
story
was
reported
by
the
New
York
Times
and
CBS
News
A
slight
pause
and
some
laughed
He
pretended
to
look
confused
then
shrugged
What
Just
naming
who
ran
the
story
He
then
got
serious
again
saying
that
John
Kerry
is
obsessing
over
300
tons
of
explosives
while
ignoring
the
fact
that
U.S
troops
have
already
discovered
and
destroyed
over
400,000
tons
of
similar
explosives
I
think
our
troops
are
doing
a
heck
of
a
job
over
there
said
Giuliani
Asked
about
the
importance
of
electing
Republicans
to
Congress
Giuliani
nodded
It's
enormously
important
for
a
president
to
have
that
support
If
Republicans
didn't
control
Congress
the
87
billion
our
troops
needed
never
would
have
gotten
to
them
He
then
pointed
to
Hamel
Your
opponent
Congressman
Mike
Michaud
D-ME
voted
against
supporting
the
troops
That
is
inexcusable
Those
who
voted
against
that
bill
were
the
left
wing
of
the
left
wing
of
the
Democratic
party
Then
the
inevitable
question
any
plans
to
run
for
president
yourself
Guiliani
smiled
as
the
crowd
got
to
its
feet
and
began
chanting
Rudy
Rudy
Rudy
When
the
applause
died
down
he
said
do
you
know
how
the
Red
Sox
won
the
World
Series
By
focusing
on
one
game
at
a
time
This
presidential
election
has
been
going
on
for
so
long
that
you
don't
want
to
start
another
one
right
away
He
implored
those
in
the
crowd
to
take
that
enthusiasm
and
use
it
to
get
people
to
the
polls
on
November
2
Classy
The
next
subject
was
September
11
and
the
president's
response
The
day
the
president
visited
New
York
City
was
one
of
the
most
difficult
days
We
were
all
concerned
about
the
president's
safety
because
it
was
only
three
days
after
the
attacks
Giuliani
said
the
president
was
adamant
on
visiting
Ground
Zero
and
spent
much
more
time
there
than
scheduled
He
then
took
a
moment
to
relate
a
story
from
his
speech
at
the
Republican
National
Convention
about
a
construction
worker's
hug
of
the
president
saying
that
humor
was
necessary
in
times
such
as
these
The
hug
was
so
intense
that
a
Secret
Service
agent
wagged
his
finger
at
Giuliani
and
said
if
that
guy
hurts
the
president
Giuliani
you're
finished
The
president's
visit
to
New
York
and
to
the
site
of
the
former
World
Trade
Center
gave
him
a
resolve
to
fight
this
war
said
Giuliani
The
final
question
was
about
military
support
of
Bush's
presidency
and
whether
that
could
tell
us
anything
about
how
the
war
is
going
Giuliani
pointed
out
that
about
80
percent
of
the
military
supports
and
intends
to
vote
for
the
president
If
only
the
American
military
was
voting
we
would
win
a
landslide
victory
he
said
adding
that
such
a
high
level
of
support
should
tell
us
the
troops
trust
the
president's
leadership
Overall
the
event
was
a
good
one
Giuliani
made
the
case
for
the
president
in
a
way
that
few
other
public
figures
can
given
the
part
he
played
in
the
attack
that
started
this
war
Tomorrow
I'll

the
Bangor
Daily
News
coverage
of
the
mayor's
visit
and
let
you
know

accurate
the
local

The
Big
Lie
Has
the
Kerry/Edwards
campaign
been
reading
Russian
history
again
This
morning
the
Today
show
with
hairless
and
squeaky...sorry...Matt
and
Katie
had
a
promo
for
an
interview
with
a
squinting
emotive
John
Edwards
to
talk
about
the
missing
ammunition
in
Iraq
The
missing
ammunition
that
was
most
likely
removed
before
the
war
By
another
country's
military
And
probably
wasn't
as
much
as
they
thought
The
original
story
by
the
New
York
Times
is
falling
apart
and
the
credibility
of
the
Paper
of
Record
is
crumbling
right
along
with
it
That's
two
major
media
outlets
discredited
this
election
season
We've
got
five
days
How
many
more
will
fall
on
their
swords
for
John
Kerry
It's
telling
that
Kerry
and
Edwards
refuse
to
give
up
on
this
false
story
like
they
refuse
to
give
up
any
of
the
lies
they've
been
spreading
on
the
campaign
trail
the
nonexistent
draft
threat
the
ban
on
stem-cell
funding
the
January
Surprise
on
Social
Security
benefits
the
plans
to
hurt
dairy
farmers
in
Wisconsin
the
plans
to
disenfranchise
minority
voters
etc...etc
This
is
a
campaign
built
on
demagaugery
and
lies
They
have
no
vision
for
this
country
which
is
why
they
grasp
at
every
headline
go
crazy
over
every
attempt
by
the
MSM
to
give
them
a
hand
I've
been
asking
this
question
for
months
and
it
still
has
not
been
answered
what
would
John
Kerry
do
as
president
We
know
he
doesn't
like
President
Bush
but
other
than
that
what
does
he
stand
for
What
are
his
core
beliefs
Sure
he
has
a
plan
but
why
not
share
it
with
the
voters
Kerry's
bile-filled
speeches
and
over-the-top
rhetoric
show
that
he's
a
man
with
nothing
really
to
say
And
his
willingness
to
lie
play
political
games
with
a
life-or-death
war
and
defame
American
troops
in
combat
show
that
Lynne
Cheney
was

Wictory
Wednesday
This

it
The
last
I
hope

lot
of
lawyers
out
there
Wictory
Wednesday
I've
written
a
lot
of
words
telling
readers
why
they
should
vote
for
Bush
Most
of
you
probably
will
already
So
I'm
going
to
use
this
last
WW
to
encourage
you
to
get
out
there
between
now
and
election
day
Encourage
your
friends
to
vote
for
the
president
volunteer
to
take
voters
to
the
polls
or
make
phone
calls
I
just
got

I
now
have

I
don't
have
an
abundance
of
vacation
days
but
I'm
taking
one
on

2
to
volunteer
for
the
Bush
campaign
and
perhaps
take
a
moment
or
two
to
document
the
craziness
and
excitement
that
is
an
election
day
I've
said
this
before
and
I
mean
it
now
more
than
ever
John
Kerry
cannot
be
elected
president
of
the
United
States
He's
a
weak
man
with
no
core
beliefs
and
no
constituency
If
elected
Kerry
will
be
the
Neville
Chamberlain
of
our
age
weakening
the
United
States
and
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
those
who
use
religion
as
an
excuse
to
kill
The
west
must
win
this
war
or
be
at
the
mercy
of
terrorists
for
decades
In
2000
a
small
handful
of
voters
in
Florida
who
punched
the
chad
for
Bush
made
more
of
a
difference
than
they
ever
could
have
thought
Now's
your
chance
Let's
send
Bush
back
to
the
White
House
with
a
majority
even
Terry
MacAuliffe
can't
deny
If
the
election
is
not
close
the
Democrats
cannot
cheat
Now
get
out
there
and
do
something

total
disregard
for

he
posts
a

about
Kerry's
credentials
on

He
uses
a
comment
from
John

Kerry
wouldn't
be
soft
on

to
go
from
being
a

to
someone
who

on

Yup

again
Prediction

Sullivan
will
endorse
Kerry.Okay

throw

Conservatives

Don't

The

William

nothing

mess

A

beat
is
more
important
than
lyrics
that
make
sense
or
the
ability
of
the
lead
to
sing
them
The
R&B
of
Motown
is
mostly
gone
replaced
by
hip-hop
Many
are
probably
reading
this

thinking
Wow...I

my

at

Pure
Baloney
Zogby
polled
402
Mainers
and
says
Kerry
has
an
11-point
lead
over
Bush
in
my
home
state
Nonsense
Pure
unadulterated
nonsense
Other
words
come
to
mind
but
this
is
a
family
blog
Where
did
Zogby
take
the
poll
Portland
Bar
Harbor
In
2000
Al
Gore
won
the
state
by
6
points
and
Gore
was
considered
a
popular
candidate
At
most
Kerry
is
probably
4
to
6
points
ahead
of
Bush
in
this
state
probably
less
In
fact
I
think
President
Bush
has
a
good
chance
to
pick
up
one
electoral
vote
from
Maine's
second
congressional
district
for
the
simple
reason
that
he's
visited
the
state
and
Kerry
has
not
Mainers
don't
like
being
taken
for
granted
and
they
really
don't
like
elitists
Those
in
the
rural
parts
of
the
state
read
most
of
it
also
are
not
fond
of
those
from
Massachusetts
There's
a
term
for
them
here
that
comes
close
to
violating
the
family
blog
thing
It
would
be
interesting
to
see
where
Zogby's
calls
were
made
If
most
of
them
are
concentrated
below
Bangor
then
he
got
a
bad
sample
If
they
are
concentrated
in
the
cities
then
he
got
a
bad
sample
If
he
called
mostly
Lewiston
and
Portland
then
he
got
a
REALLY
bad
sample
Don't
get
me
wrong
Maine
is
a
pretty
liberal
state
But
there
is
one
issue
that
many
Mainers
consider
more
important
than
most
others
second
amendment
rights
Kerry
is
terrible
on
gun
rights
and
many
Mainers
who
live
in
rural
areas
of
the
state
hunt
and
own
weapons
Politicians
in
favor
of
gun
control
simply
will
not
win
in
Maine
at
least
above
Lewiston
Most
of
Maine's
second
congressional
district
is
rural
Maine
and
Kerry
would
have
to
rack
up
large
majorities
in
Lewiston
Augusta
and
Bangor
to
offset
the
rural
vote
in
Aroostook
Washington
Piscataquis
and
Oxford
counties
In
these
counties
the
gun
issue
and
the
anti-rich
elitist
factor
will
cause
many
to
mark
their
ballots
for
Bush
Quite
simply
402
Mainers
is
not
enough
to
represent
the
wide
variety
of
political
views
held
in
the
state
Most
Mainers
split
their
vote
between
Democrats
and
Republicans
That's
why
you
see
Democratic
Governor
John
Baldacci
and
Republican
Senator
Susan
Collins
both
racking
up
large
majorities
in
the
same
election
year
Mainers
also
have
a
strong
independent
streak
which
is
why
we're
the
only
state
to
have
elected
two
independent
governors
in
the
last
50
years
Zogby
should
release
where
the
calls
were
made
and
the
demographic
profile
of
his
sample
It
sounds
to
me
as
though
he
polled
too
strongly
in
the
cities
where
the
residents
tend
to
be
more
liberal
in
their
politics
Kerry
will
win
at
least
3
electoral
votes
in
Maine
Bush
has
a
good
chance
of
picking
off
the
last
The
race
in
this
state
will
be
close
despite
what
Zogby
says
Eleven
points
is
not
just
wrong
it's
laughable

THE
FLU
James
Lileks
deconstructs
the
media
hyperventilating
about
the
flu
this
year
Personally
I
get
angry
when
the
media
goes
crazy
over
a
story
like
this
remember
the
summer
of
the
shark
and
tries
to
scare
the
living
hell
out
of
everyone
This
year
the
behavior
of
the
media
may
be
explainable
by
the
fact
that
it's
a
presidential
election
year
and
the
shortage
of
flu
vaccine
can
be
yet
another
weapon
used
to
beat
the
heck
out
of
George
W
Bush
Of
course
that
may
not
be
the
only
explanation
The
most
simple
explanation
may
just
be
that
television
reporters
are
idiots
How

you
watched

news
seems
to
exist
for
three
reasons
One
to

Two
to
give

dumb
people
a
place
to
work
Three
to
keep

industry

Seriously
though
I
wish
the
television
journalists
who
tell
these
stories
were
more
concerned
about
the
public
and
less
about
their
ratings
The
harping
on
the
dangers
of
the
flu
and
the
lack
of
vaccine
is
causing
a
panic
among
those
who
may
not
be

get

this
year
Blaming
the
president
and
the
big
drug
companies
may
make
for
good
ratings
but
it's
bad
reporting
and
an
irresponsible
use
of
the
public
airwaves
I've
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
this
blog
criticizing
the
media
for
their
blatant
partisanship
this
election
season
And
with
good
reason
But
it's
not
just
bias
that
will
lead
to
the
media's
downfall
It's
the
continual
crossing
of
the
line
between
entertainment
and
news
and
the
constant
battle
for
ratings
How
many
times
can
they
cry
wolf
before
people
just
stop
listening

Shut
Up
Shut
Up
Shut
Up
Have
I
mentioned
lately
how
much
I
hate
Pat
Robertson
Can't
stand
the
guy
especially
when
he
pulls
crap
like
this
Does
that
grinning
moron
actually
expect
us
to
believe
that
President
Bush
really
didn't
think
there
would
be
casualties
in
the
Iraq
War
The
fawning
press
coverage
Robertson
is
getting
for
this
makes
me
mad
too
For
years
the
guy's
been
the
boogeyman
of
the
right
with
good
reason
I
might
add
and
vilified
by
the
press
Until
of
course
he
says
something
against
Bush
That
Robertson
is
able
to
sucker
so
many
people
into
giving
him
money
enough
to
maintain
a
network
makes
me
sick
The
guy
has
done
some
good
things
but
should
keep
his
focus
on
God
and
not
mouth
off
about
politics
Because
when
he
does
he
ends
up
saying
things
that
embarrass
the
church
reflect
badly
on
Christians
and
lead
to
more
bad
press
Pat
I'm
sure
I
speak
for
many
Christians
here
when
I
ask
you
to
please
please
please
stop
talking
about
politics
Please
You're
not
helping
Focus
on
your
ministry
and
leave
the
politics
to
Chuck
Colson
Please
UPDATE
Okay
that
was
a
bit
harsh
I
apologize
for
the
angry
tone
but
Robertson
really
should
have
known
better
The
media
is
already
on
the
lookout
for
stories
that
will
hurt
Bush
and
Robertson
handed
them
one
on
a
silver
platter
The
700
Club
is
a
ministry
that
many
people
find
helpful
but
it's
not
my
thing
Still
I
should
not
have
impugned
the
ministry
or
its
many
viewers
As
a
Christian
the
idea
of
television
ministries
makes
me
kind
of
twitchy
given
the
sad
history
of
televangelists

Barone
on
the
Polls
Good
and
encouraging
reading
today
This
has
been
an
ugly
election
season
one
in
which
the
Democrats
have
shown
a
willingness
to
do
anything
to
win
even
if
it
means
tolerating
criminal
acts
John
Kerry
should
be
ashamed
of
his
campaign
and
himself
for
his
refusal
to
speak
out
against
the
thugs
and
haters
that
have
taken
over
his
party
and
make
up
his
base
Last
night
though
while
talking
with
my
wife
about
the
sign-stealer
I
had
a
thought
I
enjoy
reading
alternate
history
novels
and
like
sometimes
thinking
about
what
our
current
history
would
be
like
if
a
small
event
had
or
had
not
happened
Imagine
if
the
internet
did
not
exist
and
the
country
still
depended
upon
the
mainstream
media
to
report
the
news
The
election
would
probably
be
over
by
now
with
Bush
too
far
behind
in
the
polls
to
make
up
the
difference
Now
imagine
if
the
media
actually
did
its
job
fairly
and
without
bias
Imagine
if
they
scrutinized
Kerry's
Vietnam
service
as
much
as
they
did
Bush's
time
in
the
National
Guard
Imagine
if
they
spent
as
much
time
exploring
Kerry's
words
as
on
Bush's
facial
expressions
Imagine
if
at
the
first
debate
Jim
Lehrer
challenged
Kerry's
record
in
the
Senate
as
much
as
he
questioned
Bush's
record
of
the
last
four
years
And
imagine
if
pollsters
changed
their
methods
to
reflect
the
times
instead
of
relying
on
models
that
tend
to
inflate
Democrat
numbers
What
would
the
race
look
like
then
if
we
had
an
honest
media
The
media
hasn't
been
the
only
factor
in
this
race
but
they've
been
a
major
one
When
President
Bush
wins
re-election
and
I
believe
he
will
the
media
will
be
left
having
sacrificed
their
credibility
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
but
an
angry
audience
and
low
ratings
Personally
I
think
MSNBC
is
done
in
the
next
five
years
Their
ratings
are
low
and
the
commercials
on
the
network
indicate
a
low
confidence
on
the
part
of
advertisers
FOX
News
and
CNN
will
be
left
to
compete
for
the
remaining
viewers
and
I
think
FOX
will
win
more
of
them
Not
because
the
country
is
turning
more
Republican
but
because
CNN
no
longer
offers
a
watchable
product
The
other
night
I
watched
most
of
Live
From
Bagdhad
a
movie
about
CNN's
role
in
the
first
Gulf
War
They
were
an
upstart
network
then
and
took
more
risks
In
one
scene
the
actors
playing
Peter
Arnett
and
Bernie
Shaw
were
smiling
as
they
watched
the
city
light
up
with
anti-aircraft
fire
I
remember
watching
the
coverage
and
even
then
had
the
impression
that
these
guys
really
loved
their
jobs
Over
the
years
they've
become
stodgy
and
a
bit
stale
When
watching
FOX
one
always
has
the
impression
that
the
anchors
and
reporters
like
their
jobs
but
don't
consider
news
a
near-religious
experience
it's
just
a
fun
job
There's
none
of
the
solemnity
or
faux-gravity
that
runs
through
CNN's
programming
Will
the
media
change
It
will
be
interesting
to
watch
after
the
election

So
Much
for
New
England
President
Bush
and
Senator
Kerry
should
just
ignore
everything
north
of
Massachusetts
until
the
World
Series
is
over
because
the
impossible
has
happened
The
Red
Sox
made
it
to
the
World
Series
and
have
a
pretty
good
shot
of
winning
it
Of
course
no
real
Boston
fan
will
say
that
lest
their
words
be
heard
by
the
gods
of
baseball
and
used
to
jinx
the
long-suffering
team
I'm
not
a
baseball
fan
so
my
words
should
have
no
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
game
Today's
Bangor
Daily
News
front
page
should
give
the
candidates
a
pretty
good
idea
where
the
priorities
of
New
England
are
right
now
In
about
80

the
headline

is
at
the
top
of
the
page
Right
next
to
it
in
about
20-30
font
is
something
about
the
election
I'm
honestly
happy
for
the
Sox
more
out
of
a
sense
of
family
tradition
than
anything
else
Tempering
conservative
Sox
fan
joy
over
this
event

will
be

inevitable
parallels
Kerry
will
draw
between
the

and

Caught
One
Just
had
an
interesting
confrontation
with
a
Kerry/Edwards
supporter
I
had
just
put
my
laundry
in
the
car
and
had
noted
that
neither
mine
nor
my
neighbor's
Bush/Cheney
sign
had
been
taken
they've
been
stolen
once
I
saw
a
lady
walking
past
the
house
toward
the
neighbor's
When
I
pulled
out
of
the
driveway
I
saw
my
neighbor's
sign
had
disappeared
and
the
lady
seemed
to
be
crumpling
something
in
her
hands
I
passed
her
in
the
car
then
pulled
over
I'd
like
to
have
that
sign
back
She
looked
angry
and
handed
the
wrinkled
sign
to
me
If
I
catch
you
doing
this
again
I'll
call
the
police
Destroying
signs
is
a
crime
Still
nothing
but
she
looked
a
little
nervous
I
guess
she
didn't
realize
that
in
Maine
it's
illegal
to
tamper
with
a
political
sign
I
think
I'm
going
to
begin
carrying
around
a
digital
camera
and
take
pictures
of
people
violating
Maine's
law
The
most
amazing
thing
about
this
is
that
it
happened
at
3:10
in
the
afternoon
on
a
beautiful
sunny
day
Imagine
the
amazing
arrogance
and
chutzpah
it
takes
to
try
something
like
that
in
broad
daylight
Maybe
I
should
ignore
the
camera
and
just
engage
in
little
paintball
justice
UPDATE
After
stewing
on
the
incident
I
decided
to
call
the
police
The
woman
lives
on
my
street
and
it
ticked
me
off
that
she
would
do
something
like
that
to
a
neighbor
The
Bangor
police
were
very
nice
and
even
though
I
can't
press
charges
the
sign
wasn't
on
my
property
the
woman
may
get
a
visit
from
the
police
Hopefully
it
will
scare
her
enough
to
keep
her
from
doing
it
again
Now
all
of
you
know
the
story
just
in
case
my
reporting
of
the
incident
causes
her
significant
other
to
pound
the
stuffing
out
of
me
If
this
happens
to
you
here
is
the
relevant
law
in
Maine

Only
a
couple
more
of
these
and
this
one
is
important
The
Democrats
are
going

try

steal
this
election
They
are
already
preparing
to
declare
victory
if
the
race
is
close
no

what
the
results
are
The
only
way
to

this
doesn't

is
to
get
out
there
and
vote
for
President
Bush
and
encourage
your
friends
to
do
the
same
If
it's
not
close
they
can't
cheat
They
really
want
to
cheat
and
have
no
shame
or
sense
of
honor
They
are
perfectly
willing
to
delegitimize
the
president
and
the
American
electoral
process
in
a
time
of
war
simply
to
regain
political
power
We
can
keep
this
from
happening
Vote
Make
it
so
obvious
that
Bush
won
on
election
night
that
John

doesn't
even
have
the

Kids
as
Props
This
year
Maine
voters
will
decide
whether
they
want
to
cap
excessive
property
taxes
Opponents
of
the
measure
those
paid
by
the
government
have
embarked
on
a
scare
campaign
telling
voters
that
police
stations
fire
houses
and
schools
will
all
be
forced
to
close
their
doors
threatening
the
public
safety
of
Maine
voters
The
ad
campaign
is
appalling
but
fair
What's
unfair
is
the
number
of
kids
I've
spoken
with
whose
teachers
have
talked
to
them
about
the
property
tax
proposal
Teachers
have
been
telling
kids
about
the
negative
effects
of
this
proposal
and
the
pictures
they
are
painting
is
a
grim
one
schools
without
extracurricular
programs
no
music
no
art
no
sports
In
Brunswick
a
group
of
kids
got
so
concerned
that
they
held
a
rally
against
the
tax
cap
proposal
By
speaking
out
against
the
tax
cap
proposal
in
schools
teachers
are
abusing
their
authority
and
encouraging
children
to
be
propagandists
against
a
pretty
reasonable
proposal

Scaring

teachers
and
school
administrators
engaging
in
such
behavior
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
Using
kids
as

is
always
wrong

New
Symposium
Hugh
Hewitt
is
challenging
bloggers
with
another
symposium
question
In
250
words
or
less
why
vote
for
Bush
and
what's
wrong
with
Kerry?President
Bush
understands
the
nature
of
the
threat
we
face
from
terrorism
has
taken
steps
to
stop
it
and
will
continue
to
do
what
is
needed
to
keep
terrorists
from
killing
Americans
Forget
prescription
drugs
Social
Security
gay
marriage
and
all
the
rest
those
are
important
issues
but
pale
in
comparison
to
the
necessity
of
stopping
terrorists
from
killing
innocent
people
here
and
around
the
world
The
only
way
to
stop
terrorists
is
to
take
the
war
to
them
and
deprive
them
of
countries
where
they
can
receive
financing
and
training
President
Bush
has
done
that
and
deserves
your
vote
There
are
many
things
wrong
with
Kerry
his
romantic
attachment
to
multilateralism
and
his
inability
to
maintain
consistent
positions
on
issues
to
name
a
couple
Again
though
it
comes
back
to
terrorism
Kerry
does
not
understand
the
threat
that
terrorism
poses
to
the
world
His
focus
on
domestic
issues
and
his
admission
that
terrorism
is
a
nuisance
show
a
man
desperately
out
of
touch
with
reality
John
Kerry
would
play
defense
and
get
Americans
killed
These
reasons
may
sound
like
scare
tactics
but
those
who
would
make
such
criticisms
only
display
their
own
ignorance
of
the
stakes
terrorists
want
to
kill
Americans
President
Bush's
approach
would
stop
them
John
Kerry's
would
not
Maybe
that's
not
nuanced
enough
but
it
is
reality

Stay
Away
From
MY
Sacred
Cows
I
went
to
see
Team
America
World
Police
this
weekend
The
movie
is
funny
and
works
as
satire
because
it
takes
no
prisoners
on
either
the
right
or
the
left
A
warning
though
the
movie
contains
material
that
could
and
will
offend
Heck
even
I
thought
the
movie
went
too
far
a
few
times
and
I'm
pretty
hard
to
offend
The
best
part
The
songs
There
is
a
song
dedicated
to
talking
about
how
bad
the
movie
Pearl
Harbor
was
and
a
parody
of
a
country
song
that
was
pefect
Trey
Parker
in
addition
to
his
other
talents
is
a
pretty
good
singer
What's
interesting
about
the
movie
is
how
liberal
critics
are
responding
to
it
Roger
Ebert
gave
the
movie
one
star
and
his
review
shows
that
he
thought
it
was
too
hard
on
those
who
opposed
the
war
In
the
review
he
hilariously
complains
that
the
White
House
gets
a
free
pass
from
the
movie
as
though
all
movies
dealing
with
the
war
on
terror
should
knock
George
W
Bush
around
like
a

Ebert
like
many
others
seems
to
think
that
skewering
sacred
cows
is
perfectly
okay
as
long
as
they
belong
to
the
other
guy
Like
I
said
the
movie
was
pretty
scathing
to
everyone
but
if
I
had
to
say
absolutely
where
Stone
and
Parker
stand
on
the
war
against
terrorists
I
would
have
to
say
they
are
for
it
which
may
have
been
why
Ebert
was
so
offended
The
movie's
closing
speech
which
involves
words
I
cannot
use
this
is
a
family
blog
makes
the
case
for
war
in
a
manner
that
is
both
profane
and
profound
Let
me
reiterate
the
warning
though
This
is
NOT
a
movie
for
children
even
if
it
does
have
puppets
And
if
you
do
see
it
stay
until
the
very
end
of
the
credits
for
a
song
that
isn't
in
the
movie
Trust
me
it's
worth

Theresa's
Taxes
Like
many
Americans
our
age
my
wife
and
I
give
15
percent
of
our
income
to
the
federal
government
each
year
This
the
tax
rate
for
married
couples
filing
jointly
in
the
United
States
Theresa
Heinz
Kerry
whose
husband
has
been
touring
the
country
saying
the
rich
should
pay
their
fair
share
of
federal
income
tax
pays
a
rate
of
12.5
percent
That's
right
A
billionaire
who
made
5
million
last
year
paid
a
lower
tax
rate
than
most
Americans
who
earned
much
much
less
No
wonder
the
Kerrys
are
against
tax
cuts
they
don't
need
them
Lest
you
think
I'm
being
hard
on
Kerry's
wife
allow
me
to
tell
you
about
Kerry
himself
Massachusetts
has
an
optional
tax
If
people
wish
they
can
give
above
and
beyond
what
the
state
requires
Kerry
has
repeatedly
declined
to
pay
this
tax
With
Kerry's
income
the
additional
tax
would
have
been
about
687
a
year
The
man
who
wants
to
raise
your
taxes
won't
even
pay
an
extra
700
bucks
in
his

Hugh's
Symposium
Another
good
question
from
Mr
Hewitt
How
deep
a
hole
have
John
Kerry
Mary
Beth
Cahill
and
the
Edwards
dug
for
themselves
How
lasting
the
damage
There
is
no
explicit
right
to
privacy
in
the
constitution
of
the
United
States
That
fact
hasn't
stopped
liberal
judges
from
finding
one
in
the
founding
document
of
this
country
and
using
that
right
to
justify
abortion
euthanasia
and
as
a
convenient
but
flawed
argument
against
the
Patriot
Act
The
idea
that
privacy
should
be
protected
has
been
abused
but
is
a
sound
concept
People
who
choose
to
live
private
lives
should
have
some
expectation
that
the
manner
in
which
they
live
those
lives
will
not
be
made
public
by
the
media
or
government
officials
In
the
spirit
of
this
understanding
the
families
of
political
candidates
have
always
been
considered
off
limits
during
campaigns
Until
now
The
actions
of
John
Kerry
John
Edwards
and
Mary
Beth
Cahill
in
regards
to
their
treatment
of
Mary
Cheney
shows
how
little
the
Kerry
campaign
respects
the
traditions
that
have
kept
American
politics
more
or
less
civil
for
decades
The
Kerry
campaign's
decision
to
make
Mary
Cheney's
sexuality
a
topic
of
debate
shows
a
contempt
not
only
for
the
private
life
of
Ms
Cheney
but
a
misunderstanding
of
religious
voters
not
to
mention
a
simple
lack
of
good
taste
and
proper
behavior
Outing
Defenders
of
Kerry's
actions
suggest
that
his
and
Edwards
comments
were
not
improper
because
everyone
knew
Mary
Cheney
was
a
lesbian
Since
she
was
not
outed
Kerry's
actions
were
within
the
bounds
of
proper
political
debate
For
those
unfamiliar
with
the
term
outing
refers
to
the
act
of
revealing
a
gay
or
lesbian
person's
sexual
orientation
without
their
consent
Kerry's
defenders
have
clung
to
this
term
like
a
drowning
man
to
a
life
preserver
since
it
seems
to
present
the
best
defense
they
have
against
their
unseemly
actions
In
one
regard
the
defenders
are
correct
Ms
Cheney
was
not
outed
However
this
defense
doesn't
deal
with
the
real
reason
people
are
outraged
about
the
comments
made
by
Kerry
and
Edwards
The
outing
argument
tries
to
make
Kerry's
comments
about
sexual
orientation
when
in
fact
this
is
really
a
privacy
issue
of
another
kind
The
anger
directed
at
the
Democrats
is
due
more
to
the
belief
that
they
have
violated
the
rules
against
bringing
the
families
of
candidates
into
the
political
spotlight
Kerry's
error
was
compounded
by
the
words
of
his
campaign
director
Mary
Beth
Cahill
She
said
Ms
Cheney's
sexuality
was
fair
game
This
implies
that
the
attack
was
premeditated
making
it
even
more
reprehensible
Mary
Cheney
is
not
a
public
figure
She
has
not
run
for
public
office
has
made
no
speeches
and
has
not
joined
the
Bush
and
Kerry
daughters
in
attending
and
participating
in
public
events
such
as
conventions
and
awards
ceremonies
Ms
Cheney
works
behind
the
scenes
in
the
Bush/Cheney
campaign
doing
outreach
activities
She
is
a
private
citizen
who
has
chosen
to
participate
quietly
in
the
political
process
and
thus
has
a
reasonable
expectation
that
her
privacy
will
be
respected
Kerry
chose
to
abuse
the
privacy
of
a
Bush
campaign
worker
That
Ms
Cheney
is
the
daughter
of
the
vice
president
makes
no
difference
her
actions
in
this
campaign
show
that
she
wants
to
maintain
a
low
profile
and
the
Kerry
campaign
should
have
respected
that
wish
Poor
Uneducated
and
Easy
to
Command
Conservative
religious
voters
in
this
country
have
long
been
an
easy
target
for
Democrats
who
have
a
personal
bias
against
religion
The
quote
above
is
from
a
Washington
Post
article
about
religious
voters
With
this
campaign
tactic
Kerry
shows
the
hollowness
of
his
own
religious
rhetoric
as
it
is
apparent
he
and
his
campaign
staff
share
that
bias
It
is
obvious
that
Kerry
Edwards
and
their
staff
believed
that
mentioning
the
sexual
orientation
of
Vice
President
Cheney's
daughter
would
perhaps
persuade
some
religious
voters
to
stay
home
on
election
day
This
may
work
on
some
people
whose
antipathy
toward
homosexuality
rises
to
the
level
of
bigotry
which
is
an
unfortunate
fact
of
American
life
I
believe
the
majority
of
religious
voters
in
this
country
will
see
through
the
tactics
used
by
the
Kerry
campaign
Homsexuality
is
an
issue
that
the
church
has
dealt
with
since
the
Bible
was
written
It
is
mentioned
in
both
the
Old
and
New
Testaments
It
is
not
a
new
debate
for
the
church
Although
some
prejudice
against
gays
and
lesbians
still
exists
in
the
church
most
Christians
recognize
that
homosexuals
are
people
created
by
God
and
in
need
of
His
grace
just
like
everyone
else
on
earth
The
church
is
not
the
hotbed
of
anti-gay
hatred
that
writers
like
Andrew
Sullivan
like
to
invoke
as
convenient
rhetorical
strawmen
Many
Christians
know
or
are
related
to
someone
who
is
gay
or
lesbian
and
struggle
with
the
balance
between
truth
and
grace
in
those
situations
John
Kerry
obviously
believes
Christians
are
all
bigots
who
will
be
convinced
to
stay
home
or
vote
against
Bush
simply
because
Vice
President
Cheney
has
a
lesbian
daughter
His
belief
is
founded
in
nothing
more
than
a
simplistic
view
of
Christians
If
you're
a
Christian
Kerry
really
does
believe
you're
stupid
and
bigoted
enough
to
allow
Mary
Cheney's
sexuality
to
decide
how
you're
going
to
vote
The
tactic
is
so
transparent
though
that
I
believe
it
will
motivate
Christians
all
the
more
to
vote
against
Kerry
we
don't
like
being
stereotyped
and
resent
the
implications
of
Kerry's
actions
Have
you
no
sense
of
decency
During
the
Army-McCarthy
hearings
attorney
Joseph
Welch
aimed
this
question
at
Senator
Joseph
McCarthy
The
Bush
campaign
should
use
these
words
against
the
two
senators
on
the
Democratic
ticket
for
president
The
actions
of
the
Kerry
campaign
show
in
the
words
of
Lynne
Cheney
that
these
are
not
good
men
John
Kerry
has
done
so
much
in
this
election
season
to
lower
the
level
of
political
discussion
he's
lied
about
the
draft
allowed
his
supporters
to
compare
Bush
to
Hitler
used
the
f-word
to
describe
Bush's
actions
in
Iraq
that
a
further
coarsening
of
political
speech
didn't
seem
possible
Unfortunately
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
anywhere
Kerry
won't
go
if
he
thinks
political
gain
will
result
Kerry
is
the
most
opportunistic
unprincipled
politician
in
decades
and
his
lack
of
decency
and
misguided
political
instincts
may
have
finally
done
him
in
The
backlash
against
his
comments
has
just
begun
and
already
he
refuses
to
apologize
Kerry's
reluctance
to
admit
wrong
in
the
face
of
eroding
support
among
women
especially
mothers
means
the
damage
to
his
campaign
will
be
lasting
Now
that
the
debates
are
over
people
will
be
looking
for
reasons
to
vote
for
or
against
a
particular
candidate
for
hints
about
the
character
of
the
men
who
would
be
president
Kerry
and
Edwards
have
shown
us
what
sort
of
men
they
are
men
willing
to
attack
an
opponent's
family
in
order
to
score
political
points
Voters
now
have
to
ask
themselves
whether
such
men
deserve
to
hold
higher
office
I
suspect
the
answer
in
many
minds
will
be
no
and
the
polls
will
reflect
this
in
the
next
few
days
Kerry
and
Edwards
will
figure
out
the
extent
of
their
mistake
as
soon
as
the
polls
show
a
Bush
lead
and
they
will
attempt
to
apologize
or
blame
Republicans
for
their
woes
By
then
it
will
be
too
late
and
these
men
will
realize
that
the
gutter
is
a
lonely
place

VDH
Hanson

fire
today
Mr
Kerry
believes
that
we
must
return
to
the
pre-9/11
days
when
terrorism
was
but
a
nuisance
In
his
mind
that
was
a
nostalgic
sort
of
time
when
the
terrorist
mosquito
lazily
buzzed
about
a
snoring
America
And
we
in
somnolent
response
merely
swatted
it
away
with
a
cruise
missile
or
a
few
GPS
bombs
when
embassies
and
barracks
were
blown
up
Keep
the
tribute
of
dead
Americans
low
and
the
chronic
problem
was
properly
analogous
to
law-enforcement's
perpetual
policing
of
gambling
and
prostitution
Many
of
us
had
previously
written
off
just
such
naivete
but
we
never
dreamed
that
our
suspicions
would
be
confirmed
so
explicitly
by
Kerry
himself
In
the
now-lost
age
of
unperturbed
windsailing
and
skiing
things
were
not
all
that
bad
before
al
Qaeda
overdid
it
by
knocking
down
skyscrapers
and
a
corner
of
the
Pentagon
followed
by
George
Bush's
commensurate
overreaction
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
that
brought
on
all
the
present
messy
and
really
bothersome
cargo
of
IEDs
beheadings
and
promises
of
dirty
bombs
to
come
The
Taliban
and
Saddam
were
of

bad

But
really
going
all

over
there
to
topple
them
implant

change

when
the
whole
I'm

schtick
was
working
for
him
has
now
decided
his
homosexuality
is
more
important
than
any
other
issue
in
this
presidential
campaign
He
has
said
that
no
self
respecting
gay
person
can
support
George
W
Bush
based
on
one
issue
He's
gone
from
wanting
gay
people
to
break
out
of
the
community-imposed
ideological
prison
to
building
one
himself
To
do
so
Sullivan
has
ignored
just
how
terrible
John
Kerry
is
on
issues
most
important
to
all
Americans
gay
and
straight
alike
If
John
Kerry
wins
the
election
he
will
not
pursue
terrorism
He
will
wait
until
America
is
attacked
again
and
people
die
before
going
after
those
who
have
made
it
their
life's
work
to
kill
Americans
Andrew
Sullivan
wants
to
believe
that
the
religious
right
in
this
country
are
the
gravest
threat
our
civilization
faces
because
they
won't
let
gay
people
get
married
He's
allowed
his
anger
to
blind
him
to
the
fact
that
while
our
country
is
debating
the
merits
of
gay
marriage
Islamic
countries
just
kill
those
who
are
gay
President
Bush
wants
to
bring
democracy
to
a
region
that's
never
known
freedom
John
Kerry
doesn't
think
the
war
was
right
or
that
democracy
will
work
in
the
middle
east
But
that
doesn't
matter
to
Andrew
and
others
who
criticize
the
president
It's
all
about
Andrew
and
his
wants
his
needs
and
his
rights
To
hell
with
those
people
in
the
middle
east
he
wants
to
get
married
In
this
he's
like
the
general
Democrat
party
They
would
rather
win
than
do
what's
right
in
Iraq
Democracy
and
freedom
for
millions
That's
secondary
to
beating
George
W
Bush
and
giving
everyone
free
healthcare
As
I've
said
before
this
is
a
party
that
needs
to
be
punished
Vote

Need
Encouragement
First
the
debate
I've
looked
at
the
transcripts
and
decided
a
few
things
One
Bob
Schieffer
was
awful
His
questions
to
Bush
were
almost
fully
from
the
left
and
made
assumptions
based
more
on
Democratic
talking
points
than
reality
CBS
News
should
be
ashamed
of
itself
this
election
season
Schieffer's
performance
last
night
succeeded
only
in
shredding
any
last
bit
of
credibility
that
news
organization
once
had
Edward
R
Murrow
created
CBS
Dan
Rather
and
Bob
Schieffer
destroyed
it
Two
John
Kerry
and
John
Edwards
are
bad
people
This
debate
marked
the
second
or
third
time
one
of
them
has
raised
Mary
Cheney
as
a
campaign
issue
Mary
is
Vice
President
Cheney's
lesbian
daughter
and
it
seems
Kerry
and
Edwards
are
engaging
in
a
little
gay-baiting
every
time
they
bring
her
up
It's
creepy
and
rather
disgusting
politics
The
fact
that
Andrew
Sullivan
is
defending
Kerry
and
Edwards
on
this
shows
once
again
just
how
far
he's
fallen
It
is
no
longer
possible
to
call
Sullivan
an
independent
thinker
he
is
a
partisan
who
refuses
to
admit
he's
a
partisan
He
touts
instapolls
recycles
Dem
talking
points
and
defends
what
he
once
condemned
From
freethinking
maverick
to
insufferable
jackass
in
six
months
That's
got
to
be
a
new
record
Three
debates
are
pretty
useless
The
questions
were
boring
the
answers
were
pretty
standard
and
the
format
isn't
really
a
debate
at
all
Did
we
really
need
three
of
these
stupid
exercises
Bush's
pre-debate
team
did
him
no
favors
this
year
They
should
have
insisted
on
two
contests
and
refused
to
have
Schieffer
as
a
moderator
In
2008
can't
we
just
get
rid
of
all
this
nonsense
Now
the
encouragement
Sullivan
was
crowing
this
morning
about
the
post-debate
polls
saying
with
great
hope
that
Bush
is
in
trouble
Criminy
what
a
jerk
Anyway
the
Kerry
Spot
looks
at
the
track
record
of
pollsters
and
finds
it's
not
so
good
It
seems
today's
polls
are
based
on
voting
trends
and
turnout
of
2000
So
the
polls
today
may
not
reflect
the
way
people
actually
think
or
vote
Like
Instapundit
says
the
media
is
trying
to
deliver
their
15
percent
to
Kerry
and
they're
using
polls
and
slanted
coverage
to
do
it

I'm
kind
of
debated
out
right
now
From
what
I've
read
on
the
web
Bush
did
okay
Kerry
looked
cadaverous
and
Schieffer
was
terrible
CBS
really
doesn't
care
about
credibility

guess

Hypocrisy
Liberals
are
crying
foul
over
Sinclair
Broadcasting's
showing

Stolen

a
look
at
Kerry's

They
argue
the

amounts
to

note
that

It's
laughable
that
liberals
are
whining
about
the
documentary
given
their
unprecedented
use
of

this

the

gone
all-out

Wictory

It's
getting
to
the
point
now
where
these
Wictory
Wednesday
messages
are
almost
beside
the
point
The
election
is
20
days
away
and
if
you're
still
undecided
then
I
don't
know
what
to
tell
you
We're
facing
a
critical
point
in
our
country's
history
do
we
fight
terrorists
where
they
are
or
wait
for
them
to
hit
us
before
getting
them
back
Do
we
maintain
tax
cuts
or
fritter
away
American
prosperity
on

programs
Do
we
reform
the
legal
system
in
this
country
or
do
we
allow
greedy
bottom-feeders
to
continue
suing
businesses
and
doctors
I've
made
a

of
points
over
the
past
few
months
about
the
reasons
you
should
vote
for
the

and
why
you
should
give
him
money
or
time
If
none
of
the
points
that
I
or
other
bloggers
have
made
has
changed
your
mind
at
all
or
swayed
your
decision-making
process
then
maybe
there's
little
point
in
trying
any
more
Okay
one
more
attempt
If
arguments
and
logic
won't
persuade
you
how
about
simple
pride
Following
that
link
will
take
you
to
a
list
of
authors
and
their
explanations
of
why
most
of
them
are
voting
for
Kerry/Edwards
The
condescension
and
contempt
for
middle
America
in
some
of
the
responses
should
show
you
exactly
who
will
be
in
power
if
Kerry
wins
this
election
It
doesn't
matter
if
you're
a
Republican
a
Democrat
or
an
independent
If
you're
middle-class
America
if
you
shop
at
Wal-Mart
and
eat
at
McDonald's

then
these
people
hate
you
Imagine
them
in
charge
of

Another
Reason
to
Hate
Edwards
Quoted
today
by
Drudge
When
John
Kerry
is
president
people
like
Christopher
Reeve
are
going
to
walk
Get
up
out
of
that
wheelchair
and
walk
again.Is
it
possible
for
a
trial
lawyer
not
to
be
exploitive
of
a
tragedy
Christopher
Reeve
hasn't
even
been
buried
yet
and
already
John
Edwards
is
waving
the
bloody
shirt
and
using
the
tragedy
of
Reeve's
death
to
score
political
points
This
is
creepy
and
despicable
Edwards
is
likely
referring
here
to
embryonic
stem-cell
research
which
he
and
Kerry
advocate
as
a
sort
of
miracle
cure
for
the
21st
century
In
their
campaign
narrative
the
only
thing
keeping
people
from
receiving
this
miracle
cure
is
the
stubborn
backward
morality
of
George
W
Bush
who
has
banned
stem-cell
research
Like
much
Kerry
campaign
rhetoric
they
ignore
the
facts
Bush
has
not
banned
stem-cell
research
he's
merely
limited
federal
funds
to
the
existing
lines
Private
companies
are
not
forbidden
from
pursuing
their
own
research
Advocates
of
embryonic
research
though
ignore
the
amazing
successes
of
the
other
stem-cell
research
being
done
In
the
debate
John
Kerry
said
he
wouldn't
play
politics
with
science
that
he
would
trust
the
scientists
implying
that
George
W
Bush
has
not
done
that
If
the
media
were
honest
brokers
of
information
instead
of
partisan
and
ideological
cheerleaders
for
the
left
they
would
point
out
that
the
real
progress
is
in
adult-stem
cell
research
and
that
by
not
focusing
or
even
talking
about
it
Kerry
is
the
one
not
trusting
science
The
left
is
focused
on
stem-cell
research
I
believe
because
it
makes
abortion
look
good
and
they
are
desperate
to
protect
a
so-called
woman's
right
to
choose
After
all
if
some
good
could
come
of
abortion
such
as
a
cure
for
cancer
or
Parkinson's
wouldn't
that
mean
abortion
is
not
such
a
bad
thing
Wouldn't
a
cure
for
Alzheimer's
be
worth
the
lives
of
a
few
hundred
or
a
few
thousand
embryos
who
after
all
aren't
really
human
The
most
troubling
aspect
of
the
call
for
stem-cell
research
on
human
embryos
is
the
willingness
of
those
who
are
sick
to
sacrifice
the
lives
of
others
for
their
own
health
In
a
sense
they're
saying
it's
okay
to
kill
others
so
that
I
might
live...or
walk...MY
life...MY
health
are
worth
THEIR
death
The
selfishness
at
the
heart
of
this
argument
is
breathtaking
Yes
disease
is
ugly
and
debilitating
and
what
if
I
got
sick
wouldn't
I
want
a
cure
The
answer
is
of
course
I
would
want
to
be
cured
but
not
if
the
cost
is
the
life
of
someone
who
has
not
yet
taken
their
first
breath
of
air
or
felt
the
sun
on
their
face
Who
am
I
to
decide
that
my
life
is
more
important
than
theirs
I
have
little
use
for
the
sob
stories
of
a
Michael
J
Fox
or
Ron
Reagan
Jr
Anyone
can
manipulate
emotions
using
a
personal
tale
of
suffering
Society
simply
cannot
afford
to
have
our
capacity
for
empathy
used
to
justify
a
moral
wrong
That's
what
Edwards
is
trying
to
do
and
it's
repulsive
politics
and
morally
disgraceful
policy
Shame
on
him

Steyn
on
Bigley
Mark
Steyn
had
a
column
spiked
by
the
Telegraph
In
the
pre-net
days
the
column
would
have
gone
unread
until
Steyn
perhaps
put
it
in
a
book
of
columns
If
that
had
happened
the
refused
column
would
have
been
nothing
more
than
an
interesting
exercise
in
determining
editorial
judgment
by
the
time
a
book
is
published
the
immediacy
of
a
column's
subject
is
lost
I'm
glad
that
didn't
happen
this
time
Steyn
put
his
column
online
and
has
given
the
public
a
chance
to
judge
it
ourselves
The
column
is
about
the
beheading
of
Briton
Kenneth
Bigley
and
how
his
death
was
used
by
the
jihadists
Steyn
opines
that
Bigley
did
not
die
well
and
his
judgment
is
harsh
It's
hard
to
say
what
any
of
us
would
do
in
the
final
moments
before
a
hate-filled
terrorist
cut
our
throats
with
a
machete
It's
almost
beyond
imagining
The
column
is
hard
but
well-written
and
reminds
us
of
who
our
enemy
is
and
why
appeasement
won't
work
on
those
who
think
decapitation
is
a
perfectly
acceptable
thing
to
do
to
one's
enemies

talked

As
Talking
Point
I
have
to
say
I
was
very
surprised
by
Charles
Gibson
last
night
He
picked
tough
questions
for
both
sides
and
was
fair
Once
again
Jim
Lehrer
was
made
to
look
partisan
by
one
of
his
contemporaries
Bob
Schieffer
you're
on
notice
Confession
I
didn't
watch
all
of
the
debate
last
night
I
did
see
the
exchange
on
abortion
though
and
thought
Kerry
fumbled
badly
on
this
answer
QUESTION:Senator
Kerry
suppose
you
are
speaking
with
a
voter
who
believed
abortion
is
murder
and
the
voter
asked
for
reassurance
that
his
or
her
tax
dollars
would
not
go
to
support
abortion
what
would
you
say
to
that
person
KERRY
I
would
say
to
that
person
exactly
what
I
will
say
to
you
right
now
First
of
all
I
cannot
tell
you
how
deeply
I
respect
the
belief
about
life
and
when
it
begins
I'm
a
Catholic
raised
a
Catholic
I
was
an
altar
boy
Religion
has
been
a
huge
part
of
my
life
It
helped
lead
me
through
a
war
leads
me
today
But
I
can't
take
what
is
an
article
of
faith
for
me
and
legislate
it
for
someone
who
doesn't
share
that
article
of
faith
whether
they
be
agnostic
atheist
Jew
Protestant
whatever
I
can't
do
that
But
I
can
counsel
people
I
can
talk
reasonably
about
life
and
about
responsibility
I
can
talk
to
people
as
my
wife
Teresa
does
about
making
other
choices
and
about
abstinence
and
about
all
these
other
things
that
we
ought
to
do
as
a
responsible
society
But
as
a
president
I
have
to
represent
all
the
people
in
the
nation
And
I
have
to
make
that
judgment
Now
I
believe
that
you
can
take
that
position
and
not
be
pro-abortion
but
you
have
to
afford
people
their
constitutional
rights
And
that
means
being
smart
about
allowing
people
to
be
fully
educated
to
know
what
their
options
are
in
life
and
making
certain
that
you
don't
deny
a
poor
person
the
right
to
be
able
to
have
whatever
the
constitution
affords
them
if
they
can't
afford
it
otherwise
That's
why
I
think
it's
important
That's
why
I
think
it's
important
for
the
United
States
for
instance
not
to
have
this
rigid
ideological
restriction
on
helping
families
around
the
world
to
be
able
to
make
a
smart
decision
about
family
planning
You'll
help
prevent
AIDS
You'll
help
prevent
unwanted
children
unwanted
pregnancies
You'll
actually
do
a
better
job
I
think
of
passing
on
the
moral
responsibility
that
is
expressed
in
your
question
And
I
truly
respect
it.First
off
note
how
he
doesn't
answer
the
question
which
leads
me
to
believe
if
elected
he
would
allow
federal
funds
to
be
spent
on
abortions
Second
did
anyone
else
notice
the
completely
unnecessary
reference
to
his
service
in
Vietnam
Egad
Kerry
wanted
to
make
it
sound
like
he
personally
disagrees
with
abortion
as
a
Catholic
but
cannot
legislate
his
personal
beliefs
on
others
Only
he
never
actually
says
he
disagrees
with
abortion
Examine
the
first
part
of
his
answer
again
First
of
all
I
cannot
tell
you
how
deeply
I
respect
the
belief
about
life
and
when
it
begins
I'm
a
Catholic
raised
a
Catholic
I
was
an
altar
boy
Religion
has
been
a
huge
part
of
my
life
It
helped
lead
me
through
a
war
leads
me
today
But
I
can't
take
what
is
an
article
of
faith
for
me
and
legislate
it
for
someone
who
doesn't
share
that
article
of
faith
whether
they
be
agnostic
atheist
Jew
Protestant
whatever
I
can't
do
that
Kerry
only
deeply
respects
the
belief
about
life
and
when
it
begins
He
never
says
he
shares
it
He
later
says
he
cannot
take
what's
an
article
of
faith
for
him
and
legislate
it
but
what's
his
faith
in
The
fact
that
some
believe
life
begins
at
conception
Faith
requires
more
than
a
respect
for
certain
beliefs
Kerry
the
master
of
nuance
is
trying
to
have
it
both
ways
with
faith
he's
claiming
belief
in
a
set
of
God-given
standards
but
also
saying
those
standards
do
not
change
his
personal
behavior
If
that's
true
then
what
good
is
faith
Conviction
without
consequence
is
nothing
more
than
vain
intellectualism
trying
to
pass
itself
off
as
piety
If
one
truly
believes
something
it
impacts
how
they
live
their
life
or
at
least
it
should
Kerry
likes
to
quote
James
2:17
So
also
faith
by
itself
if
it
does
not
have
works
is
dead
He
uses
it
as
an
example
of
how
Bush
has
failed
the
needy
because
his
administration's
bad
policies
do
not
live
up
to
his
personal
convictions
So
by
extension
one
can
fairly
say
Kerry
is
failing
the
unborn
by
not
living
up
to
his
own
self-proclaimed
religious
convictions
If
Kerry
truly
shares
the
Catholic
belief
that
life
begins
at
conception
it
would
change
his
political
behavior
That
it
does
not
gives
evidence
that
Kerry
either
does
not
really
have
those
convictions
or
that
he
does
not
believe
personal
conviction
should
affect
public
behavior
All
of
this
leads
to
larger
more
troubling
questions
Does
John
Kerry
really
believe
anything
Does
he
have
a
core
of
beliefs
that
guide
him
In
this
time
of
challenge
and
war
can
America
afford
to
have
such
a
man
leading
it

are
the

In

energy

they
complained
about

In

one
they're
calling
him
hypercaffinated
Make
up

My
only
consolation
is
that
they
were
like
this
through

Their

seems
to
be

Well

Kerry

the

the

pull

That

What
do
Kerry's
answers
to
today's
press
inquiries
tell
us
about
Kerry's
worldview
and
character
The
short
answer
to
this
question
is
simple
nothing
good
Kerry's
answers
to
these
rather
easy
questions
display
a
naive
and
inflexible
worldview
but
more
ominously
they
highlight
character
issues
that
I
believe
should
disqualify
the
senator
from
the
presidency
John
Kerry
displayed
arrogance
a
lack
of
intellectual
curiosity
and
an
inability
to
be
challenged
In
addition
he
gave
further
evidence
of
his
almost
pathological
self-absorption
Naive
and
Inflexible
Throughout
the
campaign
John
Kerry
has
painted
a
picture
of
the
world
that
does
not
correspond
with
reality
James
Lileks
said
it
best
in
his
Bleat
of
October
1
Here's
the
thing
I'd
really
like
to
live
in
John
Kerry's
world
It
seems
like
such
a
rational
sensible
place
where
handshakes
and
signatures
have
the
power
to
change
the
face
of
the
planet
If
only
the
terrorists
lived
there
as
well.Kerry
is
an
internationalist
in
the
worst
sense
of
the
word
His
beliefs
about
the
so-called
world
community's
ability
to
deal
with
threats
is
more
romantic
than
realpolitik
His
answers
yesterday
did
nothing
to
dispel
the
fears
many
have
that
Kerry
would
put
American
security
in
the
hands
of
an
unaccountable
world
community
Once
again
he
decried
the
Bush
administration's
approach
as
the
wrong
way
and
insinuated
that
the
president
engaged
in
bad
diplomacy
by
saying
he
may
be
handed
Lebanon
figuratively
speaking
This
view
is
naive
considering
that
the
Duelfur
report
showed
the
limits
of
diplomacy
and
the
corruptibility
of
the
world
community
It
has
been
shown
that
Saddam
was
trying
to
use
oil-for-food
money
to
bribe
world
leaders
into
acting
against
the
United
States
Given
this
fact
there
is
nothing
the
Bush
administration
could
have
done
to
convince
certain
countries
to
support
the
war
in
Iraq
despite
what
John
Kerry
is
now
saying
When
he
says
he
would
do
things
differently
what
does
he
mean
That
he'll
offer
a
larger
bribe
This
answer
shows
a
lack
of
ability
to
allow
new
facts
to
impact
an
old
storyline
which
shows
an
inflexibility
of
thinking
Such
a
trait
is
dangerous
for
a
president
or
even
a
Senator
to
have
More
on
this
later
but
Kerry
has
already
shown
an
inability
to
think
outside
his
peace
at
all
costs
worldview
with
his
dangerously
dovish
voting
record
during
the
1980s
Note
that
during
his
comments
John
Kerry
never
says
he
would
have
used
force
against
Saddam
Hussein
Despite
his
talk
of
wanting
to
hunt
down
and
kill
the
terrorists
Kerry
only
talks
about
how
if
he'd
been
president
he
would
have
wanted
the
same
threat
of
force
He
sees
force
as
an
authority
not
as
an
action
As
president
this
means
Kerry
would
likely
be
much
like
Bill
Clinton
who
saw
the
military
as
a
way
to
deliver
messages
to
the
world
Like
Clinton
Kerry
would
likely
use
the
military
to
lob
cruise
missiles
or
fight
humanitarian
wars
only
not
as
an
arm
of
U.S
foreign
policy
A
President
Kerry
would
brandish
his
military
without
ever
using
it
which
would
lose
us
respect
in
the
world
and
embolden
terrorists
If
Kerry's
comments
yesterday
were
intended
to
make
him
seem
strong
and
capable
of
acting
in
the
best
interests
of
the
United
States
he
failed
miserably
Kerry's
comments
belied
his
overall
worldview
which
is
that
the
world
community
knows
best
and
the
most
effective
way
to
solve
problems
and
deal
with
threats
is
to
hold
seminars
and
sign
pieces
of
paper
It's
too
bad
he
cannot
ask
Neville
Chamberlain
how
well
that
works
Lack
of
Character
More
than
anything
else
I
was
struck
yesterday
by
just
how
arrogant
John
Kerry
sounded
Part
of
this
is
his
overall
affect
For
30
years
Kerry
has
been
polishing
his
image
of
a
somber
senator
and
easily
slips
into
a
tone
that
he
thinks
sounds
senatorial
when
in
fact
the
tone
is
condescending
and
droll
Part
of
the
arrogant
tone
though
comes
from
the
fact
that
John
Kerry
is
both
arrogant
and
self-absorbed
As
Hugh
Hewitt
has
already
pointed
out
Kerry
struck
a
grandiose
tone
in
his
answer
to
the
question
about
troop
strength
In
trying
to
point
out
how
he
thinks
the
president
has
failed
Kerry
says
I
may
be
handed
Lebanon
figuratively
speaking
Given
the
question
this
is
a
complete
non
sequitur
No
one
asked
him
about
Lebanon
and
the
fate
of
Lebanon
has
never
been
brought
up
in
this
campaign
Kerry's
raising
of
the
country
shows
that
he
really
does
believe
the
world
is
falling
apart
and
that
through
the
force
of
his
intellect
and
diplomatic
ability
only
he
can
put
it
back
together
Once
again
he
shows
that
he
really
does
believe
he
is
smarter
than
the
president
Note
the
use
of
the
word
I
I
have
a
plan...my
plan
has
a
better
chance
of
working...I
know...I
will...I...I...I
I
don't
want
to
overdo
this
point
or
make
it
seem
ridiculous
but
it
seems
to
me
that
Kerry
has
something
of
a
savior
complex
In
his
answers
about
the
problems
facing
the
world
it's
always
him
and
his
plan
that
will
solve
things
It's
never
the
military
the
Congress
or
the
American
people
Only
Kerry
and
his
vague
plan
Also
take
note
of
how
he
claims
the
president
ignored
his
advice
and
his
warnings
Once
again
Kerry
is
portraying
himself
as
the
ultimate
statesman
even
if
such
a
creation
is
entirely
fictional
This
is
arrogance
on
a
grand
scale
and
it
should
give
pause
to
voters
just
how
much
this
man
thinks
of
himself
and
how
dangerous
such
thinking
can
be
Consider
what
it
has
wrought
thus
far
Kerry
has
not
changed
his
worldview
since
the
Vietnam
War
In
that
time
the
world
has
changed
but
Kerry
has
not
He
still
believes
his
way
is
right
and
everyone
else
is
wrong
That
is
why
he
voted
against
weapons
systems
needed
to
fight
and
win
the
Cold
War
and
to
fight
the
War
on
Terror
That's
why
he
still
thinks
force
is
wrong
no
matter
the
cause
That's
why
he
thinks
diplomacy
is
always
the
answer
even
if
it's
been
proved
that
the
other
players
have
been
paid
off
Kerry's
inability
to
shift
his
views
with
the
events
going
on
around
him
shows
a
lack
of
intellectual
curiosity
He
simply
doesn't
care
to
learn
anymore
as
his
mind
is
made
up
about
what
needs
to
be
done
As
I've
stated
earlier
his
worldview
is
impervious
to
facts
Facts
are
nothing
more
than
words
that
can
be
shaped
to
fit
whatever
he's
saying
at
the
moment
Consider
his
statement
about
General
Shinseki
It's
been
proven
that
the
General
was
not
fired
by
the
president
but
Kerry
continues
to
spread
this
lie
simply
because
it
fits
his
general
narrative
about
the
failures
of
the
administration
Like
any
good
postmodernist
Kerry
believes
in
the
concept
of
higher
truth
In
this
case
the
higher
truth
is
that
President
George
W
Bush
is
a
failure
as
a
commander-in-chief
and
any
plausible-sounding
lie
that
proves
the
point
is
within
the
acceptable
bounds
of
political
discourse
In
other
words
Kerry
will
lie
if
it
proves
his
greater
point
or
if
the
lie
fits
in
well
with
his
predetermined
and
unchanging
for
30
years
worldview
This
is
dangerous
When
John
Kerry
made
the
decision
to
base
his
campaign
on
the
four
months
he
served
in
Vietnam
it
was
more
than
a
political
ploy
to
burnish
his
warrior
credentials
In
fact
it
was
Kerry's
only
honest
moment
in
this
campaign
and
showed
just
how
stuck
in
that
era
he
and
his
thinking
still
are
John
Kerry
really
does
view
everything
through
his
recollections
of
that
time
when
he
was
a
young
war
hero
fighing
an
unjust
war
that
simple
diplomacy
could
have
prevented
In
those
heady
days
America
was
always
wrong
the
military
was
evil
and
the
president
was
a
buffoon
Given
Kerry's
shameful
performance
yesterday
and
his
overall
message
in
this
campaign
voters
have
to
ask
themselves
two
questions
Has
John
Kerry
changed
in
30
years
and
Does
his
worldview
correspond
with
reality
If
the
answer
is
no
to
both
then
another
question
needs
to
be
asked
Do
you
want
a
man
with
1960s-era
thinking
to
be
our
president
in
a
time
of
new
threats
new
challenges
and
new
enemies
James
Lileks
was
right
John
Kerry
lives
in
his
own
world
For
that
reason
he
should
not
be
elected
president
in
ours

Crushing
of
Dissent
Maine
Democrats
continue
their
battle
to
keep
Ralph
Nader
off
the
ballot
despite
laughable
attempts
to
pass
it
off
as
a
personal
lawsuit
instead
of
one
filed
by

Supporters
of
Sen
John
F
Kerry
launched
a
take-no-prisoners
assault
Wednesday
against
struggling
independent
presidential
candidate
Ralph
Nader
charging
that
his
attempt
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
Maine
was
illegal
and
that
he
had
taken
thousands
of
dollars
from
contributors
to
the
Swift
Boat
Veterans
for
Truth
political
action
committee
Meanwhile
officials
at
Maine
Democratic
Party
headquarters
insisted
an
appeal
Wednesday
by
state
party
Chairwoman
Dorothy
Melanson
to
the
Maine
Supreme
Judicial
Court
challenging
Nader's
inclusion
on
the
Maine
ballot
was
not
intended
to
represent
the
party's
position
on
the
issue
This
challenge
was
brought
by
Dorothy
Melanson
as
an
individual
not
by
the
party
said
Chris
Harris
a
spokesman
for
the
state
Democratic
organization.So
now
candidates
for
political
office
are
going
to
have
their
status
questioned
because
they
take
money
from
a
variety
of
donors
Sure
some
Republicans
are
probably
helping
Nader
on
the
ballot
for
reasons
of
their
own
But
this
attempt
by
the
Democrats
is
well
undemocratic
If
they
are
so
sure
of
their
candidate
why
are
they
trying
to
keep
Nader
off
the
ballot
It
seems
to
me
their
time
would
be
better
spent
trying
to
convince
voters
to
mark
a
ballot
for
Kerry
instead
of
filing
lawsuits
against
Nader
But
that's
really
the
theme
of
this
year's
campaign
isn't
it
Against

At
this
moment
there
are
probably
Democrats
hoping
against
hope
that
the
jobs
report
due
Friday
is
bad
news
so
they
can
use
it

political
weapon

The

in

overall
than
it
was

listening

Edwards
one
could

forgiven
for

it

Great

Debate
Cheers
and
Jeers
Debates
are
interesting
in
and
of
themselves
most
of
the
time
but
what's
just
as
interesting
is
watching
how
people
handle
themselves
during
and
after
the
event
First
praise
must
be
given
to
Gwen
Ifill
whose
performance
last
night
showed
just
how
wretched
and
partisan
a
job
Jim
Lehrer
did
last
week
Ifill
was
fair
deferential
and
asked
tough
questions
of
both
sides
She
was
also
unexpectedly
funny
at
times
and
her
general
demeanor
made
the
debate
a
heated
but
civil
affair
Major
kudos
A
big
loser
of
last
night's
debate
was
Andrew
Sullivan
He
thought
Edwards
won
big
and
is
now
straining
to
support
his
position
using
polls
and
emails
from
fans
Sullivan
as
we
know
was
a
fan
of
George
W
Bush
before
Bush
decided
to
come
out
in
support
of
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
Since
that
time
Sullivan
has
become
an
unpleasantly
screedy
writer
with
his
constant
derision
of
religious
conservatives
which
he
calls
theocons
and
his
growing
hatred
of
the
Bush
administration
Sullivan
has
denied
that
it
was
the
FMA
that
turned
him
against
Bush
but
for
longtime
readers
and
past
supporters
of
his
blog
which
I
was
the
change
became
apparent
in
the
spring
Until
that
announcement
by
Bush
Sullivan
was
critical
of
the
administration
but
optimistic
and
supportive
After
the
FMA
announcement
Sullivan
took
on
some
of
the
worst
characteristics
of
the
left
at
times
linking
to
juvenile
humor
sites
that
made
fun
of
Bush
His
rhetoric
on
the
war
went
from
mildly
supportive
of
Bush
to
completely
critical
of
everything
the
administration
is
doing
in
Iraq
His
crowing
today
about
Paul
Bremer's
comments
on
troop
numbers
is
a
good
example
of
that
I
have
been
extremely
critical
of
Sullivan
on
this
blog
Other
blogs
such
as
Allah
and
Ace
of
Spades
have
also
chronicled
out
Sullivan's
downfall
The
writers
at
National
Review
seem
to
be
tiring
of
Sullivan's
rhetoric
but
have
not
yet
devoted
an
article
or
a
piece
of
writing
to
answering
many
of
the
ridiculous
charges
Sullivan
has
been
throwing
at
the
administration
and
his
fellow
conservatives
It's
probably
time
they
did
Sullivan's
reaction
to
this
debate
suggests
he's
lost
the
ability
to
think
independently
when
it
comes
to
this
administration
His
personal
feelings

Sullivan

the

do
it
That
he's

that

I

Kerry's
Opportunity
Yesterday
someone
fired
shots
into
a
Bush-Cheney
campaign
office
in
Tennessee
Vandals
have
been
defacing
lawns
in
Wisconsin
Union
thugs
ransack
a
campaign
office
in
Florida
The
left
is
growing
increasingly
violent
as
the
election
approaches
and
John
Kerry
has
remained
silent
about
the
behavior
of
his
supporters
as
has
the
media
Does
anyone
doubt
that
if
it
were
Republicans
engaging
in
these
behaviors
that
we
would
have
seen
multiple
stories
about
conservatism
and
violence
John
Kerry
has
an
opportunity
here
to
appeal
to
mainstream
America
by
denouncing
the
violent
haters
in
his
own
party
So
far
he
has
either
remained
silent
or
participated
in
Bush-hatred
so
it's
unlikely
that
he
will
speak
out
against
violence
aimed
at
supporters
of
the
president
he
wants
to
defeat
Senator
Kerry
has
been
part
of
the
problem
whipping
people
into
a
frenzy
of
Bush-hatred
at
his
rallies
and
quietly
supporting
the
efforts
of
the
most
odious
hater
in
America
Kerry
is
not
responsible
of
course
for
the
actions
of
those
who
support
him
but
he
could
certainly
do
more
to
denounce
such
actions
perpetrated
in
his
name
That
he
does
not
shows
a
weakness
of
character
and
political
cowardice
Losing
support
is
more
important
to
him
than
doing
what's
right
The
Democrats
need
to
be
punished
for
their
atrocious
behavior
of
the
past
four
years
The
time
has
come
to
remove
them
from
all
levels
of
power
This
Wictory
Wednesday
take
a
moment
to
donate
or
volunteer
for
the
election
of
Republicans
to
offices
in
your
area
And
when
it
comes
time
to
vote
don't
split
your

Debate
Reactions
Most
people
are
declaring
Cheney
the
winner
of
last
night's
debate
Many
of
the
posters
in
The
Corner
were
positive
overall
about
the
vice
president's
performance
but
some
thought
he
could
have
been
harder
on
Edwards
experience
as
a
trial
lawyer
I
disagree
In
the
one
opportunity
Edwards
was
given
to
talk
about
his
former
career
he
went
into
John
Grisham
character
mode
and
told
an
icky
story
about
a
boy
injured
by
a
swimming
pool
and
how
he
fought
the
company
over
a
02
bolt
or
something
If
Cheney
had
brought
up
Edwards
trial
lawyer
days
more
specifically
there
would
probably
have
been
many
many
more
such
stories
Unfortunately
America
has
a
love-hate
relationship
with
trial
lawyers
and
we
enjoy
stories
about
attorneys
taking
on
big
companies
on
behalf
of
the
little
guy
Sure
beating
up
on
lawyers
would
have
pleased
Republicans
watching
the
debate
I
know
I
would
have
been
happy
but
it
would
have
given
Edwards
a
chance
to
emote
which
he
does
well
The
debate
last
night
proved
once
again
that
Kerry
made
a
huge
mistake
in
his
selection
of
a
running
mate
Edwards
is
too
inexperienced
and
politically
shallow
to
handle
the
responsibilities
of
the
war
on
terror
and
it
showed
last
night
Kerry
would
have
been
better
off
picking
someone
like
Richard
Gephardt
who
has
some
credibility
and
stature
on
the
issues
His
selection
of
Edwards
shows
just
how
much
the
senator
from
Massachusetts
follows
the
media
and
how
little
he
would
lead

The

90

a

How
John

debated

How

so
they
have
jumped
all
over
the
good
closer
myth
perpetrated

The
Kerry

likes
to
say
that
their
man
is
good
at
coming
back
from
behind
It's
a
good
story
only
marred
by
the
facts
Kerry
has
spent
his
entire
political
career
as
a
liberal
in
a
state
populated
by
like-minded
voters
During
the
primary
he
was
helped
by
a
good
organization
and
some
truly
atrocious
opponents
Basically
what
Newsweek

doing

is
taking
a

talking
point
and
turning
it
into
a
hopeful
news
story
based

In

Maine
Ballot
Questions
There
will
be
two
citizen
referendum
questions
on
the
ballot
this
November
in
the
state
of
Maine
Question
One
Capping
Taxes
The
first
asks
Mainers
a
very
simple
question
Do
you
want
to
limit
property
taxes
to
1
of
the
assessed
value
of
the
property?I
will
be
voting
yes
on
this
one
even
though
I
believe
Palesky
is
not
a
well-written
piece
of
leglsiation
The
tax
and
regulation
burden
in
Maine
is
terrible
and
is
hurting
the
overall
business
climate
Maine
needs
to
shrink
the
size
of
its
government
and
especially
its
school
system
There
are
too
many
districts
too
many
superintendants
and
way
too
many
administrators
Schools
eat
up
68
of
property
tax
revenue
in
most
municipalities
and
school
spending
shows
no
signs
of
abating
anytime
soon
Maine
needs
to
find
a
new
funding
formula
for
the
schools
and
needs
to
consolidate
existing
districts
into
larger
regions
Palesky
is
far
from
perfect
but
this
is
another
situation
where
we
cannot
allow
the
perfect
to
be
the
enemy
of
the
good
Palesky
will
show
the
state
and
municipal
government
in
Maine
that
we're
tired
of
the
crushing
burden
that
taxes
are
putting
on
those
who
live
and
work
here
Having
said
all
of
that
I
think
Question
One
will
be
defeated
The
scare
campaign
by
the
anti-tax
cap
group
is
very
effective
Question
Two
We're
Here
We're
Queer
We
Don't
Want
Any
More
Bears
Sorry
this
issue
presented
a
perfect
opportunity
to
quote
The
Simpsons
Question
Two
asks
another
seemingly
simple
question
Do
you
want
to
make
it
a
crime
to
hunt
bears
with
bait
traps
or
dogs
except
to
protect
property
public
safety
or
for
research?This
question
would
ban
so-called
bear
baiting
the
practice
of
placing
treats
in
the
woods
to
attract
bears
so
you
can
then
shoot
them
I'm
not
a
hunter
but
I'm
not
anti-hunting
I
think
hunting
is
necessary
to
thin
the
populations
of
certain
animals
and
an
activity
with
a
rich
tradition
in
Maine
But
I'm
voting
for
this
ban
Last
year
I
read
a
book
called
Dominion
by
Matthew
Scully
In
the
book
Scully
makes
a
powerful
argument
for
the
humane
treatment
of
animals
As
the
title
implies
Scully
is
a
believer
in
the
Christian
doctrine
of
dominion
which
says
that
God
gave
man
power
over
animals
As
Uncle
Ben
says
though
with
great
power
comes
great
responsibility
Animals
are
more
than
ever
a
test
of
our
character
of
mankind's
capacity
for
empathy
and
for
decent
honorable
conduct
and
faithful
stewardship
We
are
called
to
treat
them
with
kindness
not
because
they
have
rights
or
power
or
some
claim
to
equality
but
in
a
sense
because
they
don't
because
they
all
stand
unequal
and
powerless
before
us."Scully's
book
is
powerful
because
he
doesn't
try
to
draw
some
sort
of
false
equality
between
animals
and
people
He's
not
interested
in
animal
rights
He
prefers
to
think
of
humane
treatment
of
animals
as
an
obligation
given
to
us
by
God
When
God
gave
us
dominion
over
the
animals
I
don't
think
factory
farming
and
bear-baiting
are
what
He
had
in
mind
He
wanted
us
to
use
animals
for
food
clothing
and
other
basic
needs
but
not
to
abuse
the
gift
given
to
us
I
believe
bear-baiting
is
an
abuse
of
that
gift
and
that's
the
main
reason
I'll
be
voting
for
the
ban

Bush

thing
I
find
most
annoying
about
conservatives
is
our
tendency
to
start
crying

minute
a
setback
real
or
perceived
happens
The
whining
and
moaning
I've
seen
this
weekend
from
conservative
websites
and
blogs
has
been
more
disheartening
than
the
somewhat
suspicious
poll
numbers
the
major

have
been
touting
The
media
want
Kerry
to
win
and
they're
going
to
do
everything
in
their
quickly
fading
power
to
ensure
that
result
You
want
encouragement
Read
Hugh
a
man
who
knows
his
way
around
politics
and
campaigns
Kerry
may
have
sounded
better
during
the
debates
but
he
provided
the
Bush
campaign
with
the
ammunition
needed
to
defeat
him
Plus
the
polls
are
probably
a
bit
skewed
Yes
the
media's
attempts
to
cheerlead
for
one
candidate
over
another
are
shameful
So
do
what
I
do
Stop

them

your

shameful
performance
of

Bleargh
Sick
today
so
blogging
will
be
light
I'm
hoping
it's
not
the
stupid
whooping
cough
that's
been
going
around
I've
read
a
bunch
of
debate
roundups
Most
people
seem
to
think
Kerry
won
on
style
and
the
MSM
are
giving
Kerry
the
win
I
mostly
listened
to
the
debate
as
I
had
the
C-SPAN
window
minimized
most
of
the
time
on
my
computer
I
didn't
see
many
facial
expressions
or
any
body
language
just
heard
the
messages
Overall
I
still
have
to
say
that
Kerry's
message
was
self-contradictory
and
almost
desperately
multilateral
His
faith
in
the
ability
of
the
world
community
to
do
anything
is
touching
but
will
do
him
little
good
as
president
Sure
he
didn't
stumble
over
any
words
and
sounded
presidential
but
didn't
say
anything
of
consequence
Except
Kerry's
biggest
error
was
saying
future
conflicts
should
pass
the
global
test
Bush's
reponse
to
this
was
the
best
of
the
night
when
he
said
American
security
should
not
depend
on
other
countries
In
fact
it
was
Kerry's
only
real
moment
all
the
rest
was
bluster
and
B.S
It's
pretty
sad
when
Kerry
has
to
pretend
to
be
something
he's
so
obviously
not
to
win
a
debate
The
president
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
what
he
believed
and
it
showed
in
his
comments
His
message
was
consistent
and
forceful
at
times
Put
me
down
as
one
who
thinks
Bush
will
stay
ahead
in
the
polls
after
this
debate
Gallup
already
has
some
evidence
to
prove
it
The
headline
is
rather
hopeful
in
its
pro-Kerry
feeling
Kerry
holds
edge
over
Bush
following
first
debate
but
few
of
the
numbers
except
for
who
won
the
debate
support
that
assumption
Next
regardless
of
which
presidential
candidate
you
support
please
tell
me
if
you
think
John
Kerry
or
George
W
Bush
would
better
handle
the
situation
in
Iraq
Kerry

Bush
54
Who
do
you
trust

handle
the
responsibilities
of

military
John
Kerry
or
George
W
Bush
Kerry
44
Bush
54
Thinking
about
the
following
characteristics
and
qualities
please
say
whether
you
think
each
one
better
described
John
Kerry
or
George
W
Bush
during
tonight's
debate
Agreed
with
you
more
on
the
issues
you
care
about
Kerry
46
Bush
49
Had
a
good
understanding
of
the
issues

Bush

So
where's
Kerry's
edge
Sure
most
people
seem
to
think
he
won
but
trust
Bush
more
and
think
he'll
do
a
better
job
This
is
almost
a
perfect
repeat
of
Bush-Goer
2000
and
Kerry's
convention
speech
the
media
will
praise
the
Democrat
to
the
heavens
and
the
electorate
will
shrug
and
support
Bush
This
debate
proves
once
again
that
substance
wins
over
style
Kerry
may
have
sounded
better
but
that
does
little
good
when
you
have
nothing
constructive
to
say

but
I
think
Bush
did
the
better
job
more
specific
more
forceful
Kerry
was
pretty
incoherent
in
his
overall
position
Bush
had
a
message
that
was
more
consistent
Now
what
will
the
media
do
with
it

Debate-Blogging
I'm
going
to
try
and
live-blog
the
debates
This
could
be
fun
as
my
computer
and
my
television
are
in
separate
rooms
I
have
a
choice
either
try
to
talk
my
wife
into
buying
a
laptop
in
the
next
two
hours
doubtful
lug
the
tv
into
the
computer
room
uh
no
or
watch
the
debates
on
C-SPAN
online
Some
pre-debate
thoughts
and
predictions
7:19
p.m
The
Kerry
Spot
says
Kerry
may
do
better
than
expected
Honestly
I
have
my
doubts
Kerry
and
his
supporters
really
believe
the
senator
is
the
smarter
guy
in
that
room
It
is
going
to
be
difficult
for
Kerry
to
hide
his
character
or
his
disdain
for
the
president
At
present
Kerry
is
having
trouble
playing
to
his
base
the
MoveOn.org
Michael
Moore
angry
left
They
want
more
red
meat
more
attacks
on
the
president
more
comparisons
to
Hitler
At
the
same
time
Kerry
wants
to
appeal
to
the
women
voters
he's
losing
and
the
men
he's
probably
already
lost
There
are
too
many
audiences
there
to
make
a
good
appeal
to
any
single
one
No
matter
what
Kerry
says
or
does
he's
going
to
offend
someone
And
that's
his
real
problem
Of
course
if
he
doesn't
completely
screw
up
the
media
will
declare
the
debate
a
success
for
him
9:00
p.m
And
away
we
go
90
seconds
to
air
You've
got
to
love
C-SPAN
Warts
and
all
9:03
p.m
The
candidates
have
entered
the
hall
The
first
question
is
about
to
be
asked
John
Kerry
gets
the
first
question
Do
you
believe
you
could
do
a
better
job
preventing
9/11
Yes
I
do
But
give
me
a
moment
to
think
9:05
p.m
Shattered
alliances
Kerry
is
going
for
blood
early
This
is
surprising
looks
like
he's
going
for
the
MoveOn
types
Reaching
out
to
the
Muslim
world
A
summit
What
on
earth
is
he
talking
about
France
has
already
said
they
wouldn't
send
troops
9:06
p.m
Bush
is
answering
Talking
about
what
the
U.S
has
done
since
Sept
11
Defending
pre-emption
talking
about
what's
going
well
in
Afghanistan
We
must
take
threats
seriously
before
they
fully
materialize
Good
line
about
Hussein
Good
He
brought
up
Libya
a
nice
way
of
throwing
down
his
sword
and
saying
Are
you
not
safe
Question
to
Bush
based
on
Cheney's
criticism
of
Kerry
People
know
where
I
stand
Trying
to
make
Kerry
look
like
a
flipper
fast
9:10
p.m
Kerry
is
bringing
up
the
diversion
argument
Iraq
distracted
us
from
the
real
war
This
president
has
made
a
colossal
error
of
judgment
Now
he's
naming
names
of
people
who
support
him...blah...blah...blah
This
isn't
going
to
go
over
well
Name-dropping
elitist
Now
he's
beating
the
podium
Could
we
leave
the
podiums
alone
please
It
makes
a
bad
noise
9:12
p.m
Where
do
you
want
me
to
begin
What
a
crapweasel
9:13
p.m
First
mention
of
Vietnam
9:14
p.m
Bush
is
answering
Bringing
up
Kerry's
former
statements
on
Iraq
He's
unusually
strong
during
this
debate
9:16
p.m
Bush
is
taking
on
the
UN
and
their
failed
inspections
Lehrer
is
asking
about
the
wisdom
of
going
versus
Saddam
first
versus
Osama
Bush
we
can
do
both
Kerry
is
writing
something
This
debate
isn't
bad
so
far
We
will
succeed
in
Iraq
because
the
Iraqis
want
to
be
free
Bush
brings
up
mixed
symbols
again
They're
going
to
push
the
flip-flop
thing
9:18
p.m
Kerry
just
made
a
mistake
The
mention
of
body
armor
and
humvees
brings
up
the
perfect
opportunity
for
Bush
to
bring
up
the
fact
that
Kerry
voted
against
the
87
billion
9:19
p.m
Bush
is
hitting
back
Bring
up
the
87
billion
vote
darnit
Kerry
is
responding
now
He's
blathering
about
allies
again
Not
a
good
response
Where's
the
specifics
9:20
p.m
Oh
crap
Kerry's
bringing
up
first
responders
Uh
the
luggage
goes
in
the
cargo
hold
dingbat
9:22
p.m
Bush
is
bringing
up
the
amount
of
money
spent
Danger
George
Bush
Danger
Conservatives
won't
like
this
stuff
but
the
security
moms
will
probably
eat
it
up
9:24
p.m
We
didn't
need
that
tax
cut
What
the
heck
When
will
Lehrer
ask
about
exactly
HOW
Kerry
plans
to
make
America
safe
9:25
p.m
Lehrer
is
asking
about
exit
strategy
His
questions
to
Kerry
seem
much
more
straightforward
Hugh
Hewitt
has
more
on
this
9:27
p.m
Bush
is
talking
about
the
benefits
of
a
free
Iraq
My
message
for
the
troops
is
help
is
on
the
way
What
does
Kerry
mean
by
that
Now
he's
telling
a
story
that
sounds
fake
Really
fake
Now
he's
talking
about
just
how
terrible
things
are
in
Iraq
Brings
up
oil
Yup
he's
playing
to
the
MoveOn
crowd
Brings
up
Vietnam
again
9:28
p.m
Summit
again
What
the
heck
9:29
p.m
The
president
made
a
mistake
in
invading
Iraq
Why
did
you
vote
for
it
then
Vietnam
again
9:31
p.m
Kerry
accuses
Bush
of
not
planning
Good
line
about
Mexico
though
Clarke
has
been
discredited
though
He's
bringing
up
the
allies
again
If
Lehrer
weren't
so
tied
to
his
script
he
would
push
Kerry
on
that
Kerry
is
starting
to
sound
a
bit
screedy
Not
good
9:32
p.m
Halliburton
Somewhere
Michael
Moore
is
laughing
Bush
does
a
good
job
of
bringing
up
Kerry's
denigration
of
our
allies
Nice
rebuttal
This
is
the
best
I've
seen
Bush
thinking
on
his
feet
9:34
p.m
Um
Kofi
Annan
ran
like
a
little
girl
when
the
first
terrorist
hit
the
UN
Kerry
made
another
mistake
trying
to
make
the
coalition
sound
small
Gave
Bush
a
good
opportunity
to
bring
up
the
coerced
and
bribed
quote
9:35
p.m
Bush
doesn't
seem
to
be
able
to
answer
the
miscalculation
question
He
does
take
the
opportunity
to
hit
Kerry
though
9:38
p.m
Kerry's
still
trying
to
talk
down
the
coalition
Bush
has
already
beat
him
on
that
I
think
He's
sounding
small
and
bringing
up
talking
points
Korea
has
nuclear
weapons
because
CLINTON
ALLOWED
IT
9:39
p.m
Lehrer
throws
another
softball
How
did
Bush
lie
Kerry's
going
through
talking
points
9:40
p.m
When
is
Lehrer
going
to
ask
for
specifics
He's
letting
Kerry
get
away
with
total
generalities
9:41
p.m
Bush
is
going
through
a
litany
of
how
Kerry
misled
us
by
changing
his
positions
on
the
Iraq
war
Pretty
good
rebuttal
9:42
p.m
Kerry
claims
to
have
one
consistent
position
on
Iraq
That's
a
big
whopper
9:43
p.m
Has
the
war
been
worth
lives
Another
one
from
the
left...Lehrer
isn't
covering
himself
in
glory
here
He's
actually
the
worst
one
on
the
stage
right
now
Bush
bringing
up
the
families
of
those
lost
it
will
probably
play
well
with
women
9:45
p.m
Good
answer
to
a
bad
question
Bush
is
doing
well
tonight
Kerry's
answer
should
be
interesting
Oh
crap
Vietnam
again
9:46
p.m
Kerry
bringing
up
Vietnam
and
his
plan
the
secret
Summit
and
the
UN
doesn't
sound
as
good
as
Bush's
sympathy
for
the
family
Jeez..."more
of
the
same
What
exactly
is
your
plan
senator
Uh
moderator
9:48
p.m
The
Pottery
Barn
rule
Kerry
is
trying
to
speak
for
the
soldiers
I
wonder
what
they
have
to
say
The
plan
again
Finally...Lehrer
asks
for
specifics
Go
Jimmy
9:49
p.m
Kerry
is
beginning
to
sound
Senatorial
Pull
up
Pull
up
How
many
freakin
times
is
he
going
to
bring
up
the
oil
ministry
He's
not
being
specific
on
his
plan
Change
the
dynamics
on
the
ground
is
a
pretty
general
answer
Bringing
up
Fallujah
was
good
but
the
alliances
thing
was
weak
Kerry's
doing
okay
9:51
p.m
Bush
is
going
to
hit
Kerry
on
Allawi
Excellent
9:52
p.m
Kerry
is
trying
to
make
it
sound
like
he
agrees
with
Allawi
Yeah
but
you
insulted
the
man
Bush
is
hitting
back
A
central
part
of
the
war
on
terror...they're
fighting
us
because
they're
fighting
freedom...those
are
the
stakes
Great
comeback
9:54
p.m
Criminy
Bush
is
on
fire
tonight
This
is
simply
the
best
debate
performance
he's
ever
given
Period
9:56
p.m
Kerry
is
going
to
bring
up
the
diversion
argument
again
Brings
up
outsourcing
Hey
I
thought
this
was
the
foreign
policy
debate
9:57
p.m
Kerry
is
talking
diverted
again
I'd
have
made
a
better
choice
So
what
country
would
you
have
invaded
Lehrer
asks
about
preemptive
war
Kerry
passes
the
global
test
Not
a
good
response
for
the
audience
You're
not
talking
to
the
world
senator
Most
people
don't
give
a
tin
crap
what
the
world
thinks
if
we're
doing
the
right
thing
10:00
p.m
When
is
Bush
going
to
bring
up
the
fact
that
diplomacy
is
what
allowed
North
Korea
to
have
nuclear
weapons
in
the
first
place
Bush's
response
to
the
global
test
comment
was
excellent
Bringing
up
the
ICC
good
rebuttal
The
ICC
isn't
popular
with
the
American
midwest
the
red
state
voters
Says
being
popular
at
the
expense
of
America
is
wrong
Nice
10:03
p.m
Bringing
up
diplomacy
to
answer
Kerry's
criticisms
I
wonder
how
Kerry
will
respond
to
the
fact
that
diplomacy
has
been
used
with
North
Korea
10:04
p.m
Kerry
brings
up
Iran
Will
he
invade
that
country
now
His
I
could
have
done
better
line
should
be
dropped
It's
petty
Kerry
is
bringing
up
North
Korea
and
just
brought
up
Clinton's
agreement
Mistake
10:06
p.m
Bush
brings
up
Kerry
errors
there's
already
sanctions
on
Iran
We
did
work
with
other
countries
Lehrer
is
bringing
up
Darfur
10:08
p.m
Kerry
is
accusing
Bush
of
sliding
by
a
question
Heh
Now
he's
trying
to
say
we
can
do
this
through
the
African
union
doesn't
he
realize
how
corrupt
most
African
governments
are
Now
he
says
we're
overextended
Does
he
think
we
should
invade
Darfur
then
How
many
countries
does
Kerry
want
to
invade
Backdoor
draft
Uh
senator
Bush
has
the
military
You're
not
taking
that
vote
away
Kerry's
avoiding
the
question
He
makes
a
good
point
about
not
allowing
another
Rwanda
10:10
p.m
This
is
hard
My
typing
skills
are
being
put
to
the
test
10:11
p.m
I
admire
Sen
Kerry's
service
to
our
country
Nice
job
pouring
hot
coals
on
Kerry's
head
Brings
up
Kerry's
flip-flops
as
a
character
issue
Good
job
although
I
wish
he'd
quit
using
the
phrase
mixed
messages
10:13
p.m
Kerry
is
doing
a
nice
job
responding
They
almost
bonded
for
a
second
But
he's
not
saying
nice
things
about
Bush
just
his
daughters
and
wife
Say
ONE
NICE
THING
I
dare
you
10:15
p.m
Bush
is
acknowledging
the
need
to
sometimes
change
tactics
but
not
his
core
Kerry
My
position
in
Iraq
has
been
consistent
Doesn't
pass
the
smell
test
Time
for
the
RNC
to
start
running
that
ad
more
often
10:16
p.m
Nuclear
proliferation
Good
answer
People
are
still
afraid
of
the
bomb
10:18
p.m
Kerry
brings
up
Kennedy
His
chicken
in
every
pot
answer
is
something
weak
Bush
agrees
with
Kerry
on
WMDs
Corrects
the
senator
on
funding
Internet
is
getting
flaky
10:20
p.m
The
president
has
had
four
years
Well
John...he's
had
a
few
other
things
to
think
about
you
know
10:21
p.m
Did
you
misjudge
Putin
GREAT
question
What's
happening
in
Russia
is
scary
Bush
is
fumbling
a
bit
on
the
question
but
bringing
up
the
horror
of
Belsan
is
good
Talking
about
his
good
relationship
and
how
it
allows
him
to
criticize
Putin
Effective
10:23
p.m
Kerry
is
talking
about
his
visit
to
Lubyanka
KGB
Visitors
for
Truth
Sorry
couldn't
resist
10:24
p.m
Kerry's
answer
on
Russia
was
good
Should
have
stuck
with
that
instead
of
going
into
Bush
lied
and
mission
accomplished
Don't
take
it
personally...looked
at
the
same
intelligence
came
to
the
same
conclusion
Good
comeback
Kerry
is
going
on
about
the
coalition
again
after
authorizing
war
Talks
about
an
incredible
mess
in
Iraq
10:26
p.m
Closing
arguments
Kerry
brings
up
his
tagline
stronger
at
home...blah
Brings
up
Vietnam
again
reuses
the
line
from
his
acceptance
speech
Brings
up
his
plan
without
specifying
his
plan
Talks
about
bringing
allies
to
his
side
even
though
Bush
took
him
to
school
on
that
already
Talks
optimistic
but
has
done
nothing
but
gripe
for
the
past
year
and
a
half
not
to
mention
the
past
90
minutes
10:29
p.m
Bush
close
Not
a
bad
job
Nice
bringing
up
of
the
draft
should
have
hit
Kerry
on
that
harder
Talks
specifics
about
Iraq
Brings
up
lines
from
his
own
acceptance
speech
Not
a
bad
close
more
optimistic
than
Kerry

We're
Not
Sure
But
CNN's
headline
for
its
poll
story
Bush
apparently
leads
Kerry
in
pre-debate
poll
Sure
If
apparently
means
by
8
points
Do
you
think
the
headline
would
have
been
the
same
had
the
poll
positions
been
reversed
If
Kerry
had
been
ahead
of
Bush
at
this

with

the
headline
would
likely
have
been
Kerry

Kerry
in

Yup
They're
Worried
Senator
Edwards
visited
Maine
for
the
second
time
this
month
If
the
crowd
estimates
in
the
Portland
Press
Herald
are
any
indication
the
Kerry
campaign
has
some
work
to
do
in
Maine
Lewiston
where
Edwards
spoke
is
a
Democrat
stronghold
in
the
state
Gore
whomped
Bush
in
2000
Bush
only
received
5,255
votes
to
Gore's
9,663
Only
2,500
people
showed
up
for
the
rally
That
Edwards
has
to
visit
Lewiston
at
all
is
a
bad
sign
At
this
point
in
the
campaign
Edwards
should
be
spending
his
time
in
the
contested
areas
of
battleground
states
not
areas
that
are
normally
reliably
Democratic
So
far
he's
visited
Orono
which
went
heavily
Gore
in
2000
Gore
2,701
Bush
1,506
and
now
Lewiston
Neither
location
shows
any
great
degree
of
confidence
in
their
ability
to
sway
swing
voters
it
seems
at
present
they're
more
interested
in
rallying
the
party
faithful
The
problem
is
that
the
party
faithful
should
have
been
rallied
by
the
convention
That
didn't
happen
so
now
Kerry
and
Edwards
are
forced
to
play
catch-up
The
rhetoric
used
by
Edwards
and
supporters
shows
a
growing
discouragement
with
the
state
of
the
race
Edwards
speech
focused
almost
exclusively
on
foreign
policy
It
comes
as
he
and
Kerry
are
under
attack
from
Bush
supporters
who
are
telling
voters
a
terrorist
attack
is
more
likely
if
they
elect
the
Democratic
candidates
This
is
an
effort
to
exploit
one
of
the
great
tragedies
in
American
history
Sept
11
and
use
it
for
personal
gain
Edwards
said.And
who
was
standing
on
stage
with
Kerry
last
week
Widows
of
September
11
perhaps
I
guess
only
one
party
can
exploit
September
11
Edwards
language
is
interesting
here
Note
how
he
calls
September
11
the
worst
terrorist
attack
in
U.S
history
a
tragedy
A
tragedy
is
a
hurricane
or
an
earthquake
What
happened
on
September
11
was
a
cold-blooded
attack
on
civilians
by
people
with
an
extremist
ideology
It
was
tragic
but
not
a
tragedy
More
proof
that
the
Democrats
just
don't
get
it
Then
there's
the
obligatory
they're
too
dumb
to
vote
for
us
comment
by
a
Kerry/Edwards
supporter
Kerry
supporters
in
line
to
hear
Edwards
said
the
race
in
Maine
is
close
because
voters
are
believing
lies
coming
from
the
Bush
campaign
about
Iraq
the
economy
and
the
national
deficit
When
voters
better
understand
these
issues
Kerry
will
regain
the
lead
he
held
earlier
this
year
they
said
The
economy
is
stronger
That
is
a
lie
The
country
is
safer
That
is
lie
said
Patty
Fecteau
of
Monmouth
as
she
waited
in
line.When
voters
better
understand
the
issues
then
Kerry
will
jump
ahead
in
the
polls
and
race
to
victory
When
people
just
come
to
their
senses
is
the
subtext
here
We're
all
being
brainwashed
by
the
Halliburton-funded
media
run
by
the
Bushitler
shock
troops
most
of
whom
are
wearing
pajamas
Sorry
folks
Conspiracy
theories
and
wishful
thinking
won't
make
your
guy
more
appealing
than
the
president
These
Democrats
just
don't
want
to
admit
that
they
nominated
the
wrong
guy
for
the
wrong
reasons
Kerry
is
a
terrible
candidate
elitist
unappealing
and
wishy-washy
Even
after
all
this
time
some
Democrats
still
haven't
gotten
the
message
not
everyone
hates
Bush
as
much
as
you
do
Contrary
to
what
Ms
Fecteau
wants
to
believe
the
economy
is
getting
stronger
That's
part
of
the
reason
why
Kerry
and
Edwards
have
had
to
switch
gears
on
their
campaign
and
begin
talking
about
Iraq
and
national
security
instead
of
the
economic
picture
We're
not
safer
How
many
terrorist
attacks
have
we
had
in
the
United
States
since
September
11
That
would
be
zero
It's
obvious
that
Kerry
is
an
afterthought
to
those
Democrats
who
still
really
believe
Bush-hatred
is
enough
to
win
this
election
Maybe
they
should
ask
George
McGovern
and
Walter
Mondale
how
well
playing
to
the
haters
worked
in
their
campaigns

The
Dark
Tower
Ends
In
1987
I
started
reading
a
book
that
was
a
strange
blend
of
western
science
fiction
and
fantasy
It
was
called
The
Gunslinger
and
was
about
a
man
named
Roland
who
was
on
a
quest
to
find
the
Dark
Tower
This
afternoon
I
finished
the
seventh
and
final
book
in
the
series
I
won't
reveal
the
end
but
I
will
say
the
conclusion
of
Roland's
quest
wasn't
entirely
a
surprise
The
book
was
good
and
unlike
some
other
recent
King
writings
didn't
have
too
much
bloat
It
was
as
long
as
it
needed
to
be
for
King
to
finish
the
story
he
began
writing
in
1970
There
is
a
surprising
amount
of
emotional
weight
to
the
story
and
some
uncomfortable
moments
when
King
retells
a
bit
of
recent
tragic
history
in
his
own
life
Overall
the
story
ended
well
and
was
a
fitting
conclusion
to
a
story
I've
been
following
and
have
enjoyed
for
17
years
Thanks
for
taking
us
to
the
end

Cannot
Stinkin
Believe
This
Headline
from
MSNBC
on
a
story
by
Bush-hating
Dana
Milbank
Anti-Kerry
rhetoric
tests
limits
The
story
itself
is
full
of
quotes
about
how
terrible
it
is
that
the
Bush
administration
is
accusing
Kerry
of
undermining
the
war
in
Iraq
Milbank
writes
that
it's
a
line
of
attack
that
tests
the
conventional
bounds
of
political
rhetoric
He's
right
or
at
least
he
would
be
if
Kerry
weren't
actually
you
know
undermining
the
war
effort
in
Iraq
This
story
is
a
pathetic
attempt
to
make
Kerry
look
like
the
victim
of
some
terrible
attack
by
the
Republicans
when
in
fact
it's
Kerry
who
is
taking
the
unprecedented
step
of
criticizing
an
ally
in
a
time
of
war
for
political
gain
during
a
presidential
campaign
Kerry's
comments
after
Allawi's
speech
were
petulant
angry
and
small
All
three
can
be
used
to
describe
Kerry
as
well
There's
no
mention
in
the
story
of
the
hateful
and
ugly
rhetoric
that
has
been
thrown
at
President
Bush
for
the
past
four
years
Milbank
is
using
friendly
sources
a
former
Clinton
speechwriter
and
some
selective
omission
to
paint
a
picture
of
history
being
made
by
the
nasty
meanie
Republicans
Where
was
Milbank
when
Bush
was
subjected
to
a
barrage
of
anger
from
the
Democrat
candidates
The
point
of
his
piece
seems
to
be
that
criticism
of
Republicans
is
just
normal
but
say
something
about
a
Democrat
even
if
the
rhetoric
is
warranted
by
the
Democrat's
own
behavior
is
hate
speech
Where's
the
story
about
the
absolutely
unprecedented
attack
on
all
fronts
from
the
entertainment
and
media
elite
on
the
president
The
Democrats
are
calling
the
Republicans
un-American
and
un-democratic
It
seems
to
me
that
the
only
people
who
have
problems
with
democracy
are
the
party
that
takes
its
name
from
the
word
Every
time
Kerry
and
Edwards
are
confronted
with
legitimate
criticism
they
whine
and
cry
If
they
can't
handle
harsh
words
how
are
they
going
to
handle
harsh
actions
by
those
who
hate
and
attack
America

Disgusting
Desperate
Pathetic
The
Democrats
have
hit
rock
bottom
Kerry
and
surrogates
are
accusing
the
Bush
administration
of
wanting
to
bring
back
the
draft
This
shows
just
how
bad
things
have
gotten
for
Kerry
He
can't
inspire
voters
to
support
him
so
he'll
just
settle
for
scaring
them
This
is
repulsive
I
have
never
voted
a
straight
ticket
In
the
last
few
elections
I've
picked
a
Democrat
or
two
that
I
thought
would
do
a
good
job
representing
Maine
This
year
for
the
first
time
I'm
voting
entirely
for
Republicans
I've
come
to
the
conclusion
that
Democrats
cannot
be
trusted
with
the
national
security
of
this
country
or
with
power
of
any
type
We
simply
cannot
afford
to
allow
bitter
partisans
like
Max
Cleland
and
empty
suits
like
John
Edwards
to
run
this
country
This
latest
ploy
by
the
Democrats
proves
they
are
willing
to
do
anything
to
regain
power
and
such
people
cannot
be
trusted
with
it
America
needs
a
president
who
can
inspire
people
to
follow
him
and
not
just
scare
people
into
voting
against
his
opponent
John
Kerry
is
a
small
man
with
big
desires
he
wants
to
be
president
not
out
of
a
desire
to
do
good
but
because
he
wants
to
be
powerful
His
various
ploys
to
reach
the
White
House
show
just
how
uninspiring
he
really
is
and
how
little
he
cares
about
those

ABC

I've
noticed
a
disturbing
trend
in
ABC's
radio
news
broadcasts
When
reporting
on
the
election
the
news
producers
will
play
John
Kerry
quotes
but
paraphrase
the
president
This
happens
hour
after
hour
a
few
times
a
day
It's
annoying
but
I
think
it
probably
helps
the
president
in
the
long
run
Kerry
sounds
terrible
when
he
speaks
especially
when
criticizing
President
Bush
which
is
almost
constantly
He
doesn't
modulate
his
voice
steps
on
his
good
lines
and
generally
drones
on
and
on
The
soundbites
are
terrible
and
it's
perhaps
a
sign
of
how
desperate
the
MSM
is
to
help
Kerry
that
they
don't
realize
just
how
bad
he
is
on
the
stump
Still
though
today's
paraphrasing
of
Bush's
excellent
UN
speech
in
favor
of
insipid
Kerry
quotes
is
unforgivable
The
president
laid
out
a
specific
human
rights
agenda
and
showed
how
America
is
fulfilling
the
mission
of
the
UN
in
its
international
actions
Kerry
just
complained
again
Optimism
Pessimism
Maybe
ABC
thinks
pessimism
just
sounds
better
Or
maybe
they
just
want

CBS
Admits
the
Obvious
The
NYTimes
is
reporting
that
CBS
News
will
admit
it
was
decieved
about
the
authenticity
of
the
Bush
AWOL
documents
Frankly
it's
too
late
If
this
had
come
a
few
days
after
the
report
was
aired
it
might
show
courage
on
the
part
of
CBS
They
did
not
and
now
they
look
like
desperate
partisan
buffoons
CBS
has
realized
there's
no
one
left
to
defend
them
and
is
only
saying
this
to
keep
from
losing
every
scrap
of
credibility
they
built
over
decades
It
won't
work
and
CBS
has
to
do
more
Dan
Rather
John
Roberts
Mary
Mapes
and
Andrew
Heyward
should
go
They
have
all
been
complicit
in
perpetuating
this
fraud
against
the
president
and
against
the
American
people
All
of
them
should
apologize
on
the
air
then
be
fired
No
pension
no
golden
parachute
just
goodbye
Then
CBS
should
aggressively
report
where
they
got
the
memos
and
why
a
major
story
was
based
on
the
testimony
of
so
many
Democratic
partisans
It's
time
to
start
protecting
the
brand
again
and
restoring
faith
in
CBS
news
They
have
to
correct
their
mistake
and
once
again
prove
their
objectivity
Finally
Bernard
Goldberg
should
be
put
in
charge
of
CBS
news
He's
a
critic
of
the
news
but
is
a
good
reporter
and
knows
the
value
of
fairness
in
reporting
Plus
putting
someone
like
him
in
charge
of
the
news
division
would
help
ferret
out
those
who
allow
their
partisanship
or
ideology
to
trump
fairness
in
reporting
CBS
can't
get
away
by
just
apologizing
and
moving
on

has

Bush

President
Bush
will
visit
Maine
this

some

unhappy

Jesse

Youth
Vote
Nonsense
Like
National
Review's
Jonah
Goldberg
I'm
no
fan
of
the
entire
youth
voter
movement
Every
presidential
election
organizations
crop
up
in
an
attempt
to
increase
the
so-called
youth
vote
Judging
from
the
marketing
techniques
of
MTV's
Choose
or
Lose
and
PunkVoter
those
who
are
in
charge
of
such
organizations
seem
to
regard
the
youth
vote
as
a
group
with
short
attention
spans
who
are
easily
impressed
by
flashy
graphics
loud
music
and
leftist
politics
It
was
with
some
amusement
that
I
visited
my
hometown
paper
today
and
saw
the
following
story
Group
strives
to
boost
youth
turnout
at
polls
Full
disclosure
I
went
to
college
with
the
reporter
who
wrote
this
story
and
he's
a
great
guy
The
story
was
unintentionally
hilarious
Their
very
name
suggests
they're
a
tough
crowd.Their
posters
which
feature
the
Statue
of
Liberty
brandishing
a
baseball
bat
erase
any
remaining
doubt
But
members
of
the
League
of
Pissed
Off
Voters
despite
the
group's
provocative
name
say
they
are
more
concerned
than
angry
about
the
state
of
the
youth
political
movement."The
League
of
Pissed-Off
Voters
The
very
name
suggests
a
level
of
self-righteous
immaturity
that's
inappropriate
for
discussions
of
policy
proposals
and
the
future
of
the
country
Of
course
that's
assuming
these
people
actually
care
about
issues
No
one's
paying
attention
to
us
said
Hannah
Kates-Goldman
a
19-year-old
from
Bangor
who
was
one
of
about
30
people
to
gather
around
a
table
at
Pat's
Pizza
to
listen
to
the
group's
organizers
and
of
course
eat
some
pie
People
need
to
have
the
feeling
that
the
people
representing
them
are
listening
to
them
she
said.This
election
has
two
major
candidates
One
is
talking
about
four
months
in
his
life
that
occured
over
30
years
ago
and
is
promising
to
keep
spending
government
money
on
failed
programs
The
other
has
cast
a
vision
for
the
future
that
was
directed
right
at
those
who
are
in
Ms
Kates-Goldman's
demographic
group
So
why
the
whining
The
article
doesn't
say
The
article
goes
on
to
describe
an
agreement
to
create
a
voter's
guide
for
youth
voters
Of
course
this
assumes
that
youth
voters
are
a
homogenous
group
who
will
all
agree
on
the
issues
I
wonder
what
ideological
stance
the
voter's
guide
will
take
Hmmm
Later
in
the
article
we
find
a
quote
by
a
professor
who
thinks
he
knows
what
the
youth
of
today
are
thinking
Jim
Melcher
a
political
scientist
at
the
University
of
Maine
at
Farmington
said
war
this
time
in
Iraq
could
again
be
an
issue
that
would
bring
more
young
voters
to
the
polls
in
2004
There's
some
anxiety
about
jobs
but
people
are
paying
attention
to
the
war
Melcher
said
predicting
the
issue
among
young
voters
anyway
likely
would
favor
Democrat
John
Kerry.It
seems
Professor
Melcher
is
living
in
the
same
decade
in
which
John
Kerry
has
based
his
campaign
From
what
I've
seen
of
the
youth
vote
young
adults
vary
widely
on
their
opinions
of
the
war
just
like
everyone
else
The
idea
that
somehow
youth
will
agree
on
this
specific
issue
is
ridiculous
It
sounds
to
me
like
the
good
professor
is
indulging
in
a
little
bit
of
stereotyping
It's
a
wild
card
though
Melcher
added
There
could
be
young
people
out
there
with
buddies
serving
in
Iraq
thinking
they
need
to
support
the
president."Catch
that
Young
people...thinking
they
need
to
support
the
president
Such
people
are
obviously
brainwashed
Heck
this
professor
feels
sorry
for
the
poor
wretches
thinking
they
need
to
support
this
obviously
illegal
and
unjustifiable
war
just
because
their
buddies
are
serving
in
the
war
Having
worked
in
academia
I
can
tell
you
that
such
offhand
condescension
toward
conservatives
is
routine
The
professor
probably
didn't
even
realize
what
he
was
saying
So
what
exactly
are
the
political
leanings
of
this
group
The
league
which
has
70
chapters
in
the
16
swing
states
is
officially
non-partisan
but
tends
to
lean
to
the
left
listing
among
its
allies
such
groups
as
America
Coming
Together
and
America
Votes
both
of
which
have
been
publicly
critical
of
Bush
At
its
last
meeting
the
Portland
branch
endorsed
Kerry
as
well
as
the
defeat
of
the
so-called
Palesky
tax
cap
that
will
appear
on
the
Maine
ballot.Oh
they're
liberal
and
affiliated
with
Bush-haters
No
kidding
I
wonder
though
why
they
bother
with
the
pretense
of
non-partisanship
While
Kates-Goldman
said
she
would
be
voting
for
Kerry
albeit
somewhat
reluctantly
her
19-year-old
friend
Thom
Barrows
said
he
was
dissatisfied
with
all
the
candidates
including
independent
Ralph
Nader
and
would
vote
only
in
the
local
elections
They
don't
represent
anything
I
stand
for
Barrows
said.So
the
girl
who
complained
at
the
beginning
of
being
ignored
is
voting
for
the
one
guy
guaranteed
to
ignore
her
in
favor
of
older
people
and
special
interest
groups
with
more
money
Youth
politics
working
against
youth
concerns
Way
to
go
Then
there's
Mr
Barrows
One
shudders
to
think
what
he
must
believe
since
none
of
the
major
candidates
represent
anything
he
stands
for
not
even
Nader
I
suppose
it's
good
that
he's
voting
for
local
candidates
I
know
I'm
being
harsh
on
these
well-meaning
people
but
this
sort
of
thing
really
irritates
me
This
is
what
happens
when
identity
politics
trumps
reasonable
debate
and
when
people
are
encouraged
to
think
of
one
set
of
beliefs
as
more
cool
than
another
If
these
youth
voter
groups
spent
half
a
second
analyzing
the
platforms
of
the
major
candidates
they
would
see
that
the
Republicans
are
the
forward-looking
party
in
this
election
and
the
Democrats
don't
want
to
change
a
single
thing
Of
course
it
won't
happen
because
youth
voter
groups
are
not
about
ideology
they're
a
modern
political
machine
Instead
of
unions
or
minorities
these
machines
are
trying
to
turn
out
youth
to
vote
for
the
Democrats
I'm
hoping
members
of
my
generation
are
smart
enough
to
realize
we're
being
used
by
those
who
desperately
want
to
cling
to
power
and
vote
against
their
pathetic
attempts
to
co-opt
our
demographics
for
their
political
ends
I
can't
say
I'm
overly
optimistic
though

Andrew

Bush

keeping

Two
of

now
say
the

ignored

they
raised
prior
to
the

of

about
the
disputed
National
Guard
records
attributed
to
Lt
Col
Jerry
Killian
who
died
in

Emily
Will
a
veteran
document
examiner
from
North
Carolina
told
ABC
News
she
saw
problems
right
away
with
the
one
document
CBS
hired
her
to
check
the
weekend
before
the
broadcast
I
found
five
significant
differences
in
the
questioned
handwriting
and
I
found
problems
with
the
printing
itself
as
to
whether
it
could
have
been
produced
by
a
typewriter
she
said
Will
says
she
sent
the
CBS
producer
an
e-mail
message
about
her
concerns
and
strongly
urged
the
network
the
night
before
the
broadcast
not
to
use
the
documents
I
told
them
that
all
the
questions
I
was
asking
them
on
Tuesday
night
they
were
going
to
be
asked
by
hundreds
of
other
document
examiners
on
Thursday
if
they
ran
that
story
Will
said
But
the
documents
became
a
key
part
of
the
60

broadcast
questioning
President
Bush's
National
Guard
service
in
1972
CBS
made
no
mention
that
any

disputed
the
authenticity
I
did
not

wanted
to

told

Quarters
wonders
whether
this
rises
to
the
level
of

CBS
ran
with
a
story
they
knew
would
be
damaging
to
the
president
ignoring
warnings
from
experts
that
their
key
evidence
might
be
phony
If
it's
not
libel
it's
certainly
journalistic
malpractice

companies
if
it
means
purging
journalism
of
these
vicious
partisans
This
is
but
the
first
step
the
network
should
take
to
rebuild
trust
After
firing
Rather
Mapes
and
Hayward
CBS
should
disclose
its
sources
and
investigate
where
the
memos
originated
then
let
events
take
their
course
Given
Terry
MacAuliffe's
total
trust
in
the
memos
I
think
the
DNC
has
to
be
looked
at
seriously
They
have
the
most
to
gain
from
smearing
the
president's
National
Guard
service
and
if
they
had
anything
to
do
with
this
forgery
the
public
deserves
to
know
that
ABC
News
should
be
applauded
for
its
aggressive
reporting
on
this
story
Sure
they're
doing
it
to
hurt
a
competitor
but
that
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
their
reporters
have
done
some
excellent
work
Since
last
Friday
Dan
Rather
has
been
trying
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof
from
his
network
to
those
who
criticize
him
ABC's
report
tonight
will
make
it
harder
for
that
tactic
to
be
successful

It's
the
DNC
The
timing
is
too
good
I
would
like
to
think
that
a
major
political
party
in
the
U.S
would
cover
its
tracks
better
but
I
believe
Dan
Rather's
source
is
someone
at
the
Democratic
National
Committee
It's
obvious
from
the
video
linked
above
watch
at
your
own
risk
it's
disgusting
and
proof
positive
that
Moore's
disease
has
taken
root
in
the
party
that
the
Democrats
counted
on
the
60
Minutes
II
story
as
the
opening
salvo
in
its
Fortunate
Son
campaign
against
the
president
They
are
still
operating
on
the
old
media
paradigm
and
don't
see
the
internet
as
a
major
force
The
person
that
produced
the
memos
or
supplied
them
to
Dan
Rather
never
thought
the
authenticity
of
the
memos
would
be
called
into
question
at
all
That
they
would
be
discredited
so
quickly
and
so
authoritatively
was
beyond
the
realm
of
possibility
Howie
Carr
was
predicting
today
that
USA
Today
would
be
the
first
to
crack
under
the
pressure
and
retract
the
memo
story
When
the
wall
finally
does
come
down
it's
time
to
ask
the
media
and
the
DNC
to
do
what
they
are
asking
of
President
Bush
Tell
the
Truth
CBS
should
divulge
its
source
on
this
story
If
they
do
not
then
they
are
purposefully
perpetrating
a
fraud
and
should
be
held
accountable
for
their
actions
If
CBS
ultimately
retracts
its
story
Dan
Rather
Mary
Mapes
and
Andrew
Hayward
should
all
either
resign
or
be
fired
If
Viacom
refuses
to
do
the
right
thing
I'm
sure
millions
of
consumers
around
the
country
can
find
a
way
to
persuade
them
I
have
plenty
of
other
places
I
can
spend
my
money
This
the
most
serious
political
dirty
trick
since
Watergate
and
the
media
and
the
public
should
treat
it
as
such
The
media
has
a
chance
to
partially
redeem
itself
for
the
excessive
partisanship
it
has
shown
this
election
season
Will
it
take
that

Tied
John
Zogby
says
Bush
and
Kerry
are
tied
at
43
percent
each
in
my
home
state
The
poll
was
taken
last
Thursday
before
John
Kerry's
comments
regarding
the
end
of
the
assault
weapons
ban
Maine
is
a
state
where
hunting
is
a
near-sacred
activity
and
people
here
love
their
guns
It's
relatively
easy
to
get
a
weapon
here
they
sell
them
in
at
least
half
a
dozen
places
in
the
Bangor
area
alone
Maine
is
one
of
two
states
Nebraska
being
the
other
that
splits
its
electoral
votes
The
winner
of
the
popular
vote
in
the
state
gets
the
two
statewide
electoral
votes
The
congressional
district
votes
are
apportioned
to
whomever
wins
a
particular
district
Maine
has
two
Kerry
will
win
district
one
which
is
basically
Portland
District
two
is
up
for
grabs
I
think
Aroostook
County
or
the
County
as
it's
known
up
here
is
somewhat
more
conservative
and
Gore
barely
won
it
in
2000
The
gun
issue
could
make
a
huge
difference
this
year
as
well
as
the
fact
that
Kerry
is
from
Massachusetts
People
in
Central
and
Northern
Maine
like
to
joke
that
the
real
Maine
ends
at
Augusta
with
Southern
Maine
being
a
suburb
of
Boston
The
intrusive
liberalism
of
Massachusetts
residents
is
not
forgotten
in
the
county
as
out-of-staters
have
been
trying
for
years
to
make
a
large
portion
of
it
a
national
park
a
move
resented
by
natives
I
predict
that
Bush
will
get
one
electoral
vote
from
Maine
the
second
district
Kerry
will
win
the
state
but
only
barely
which
will
net
him
the
other
three
Kerry
has
done
a
lot
of
foolish
things
this
election
but
it's
his
comments
on
the
end
of
the
assault
weapons
ban
that
may
cost
him
the
presidency
That
and
his
inept
pandering
to
gun
owners
I
don't
own
any
guns
myself
unless
you
count
a
paintball
gun...er...marker
but
I
know
how
important
second
amendment
issues
are
to
rural
voters
I
have
a
feeling
Kerry
will
figure
that
out
around
November

Still
Believe
the
Memos
Are
Real
This
might
help
convince
you
otherwise
An
impressive
takedown
of
CBS
Drudge
is
reporting
that
despite
the
discrediting
of
the
memos
Democrats
are
still
planning
to
focus
on
Bush's
National
Guard
service
and
the
lies
he
told
about
it
Good
luck
guys
If
this
is
what
Kerry
is
depending
on
to
bring
Bush's
poll
numbers
down
then
he's
truly
become
desperate
Bush
can
now
run
yet
another
flip-flop
ad
This
could
quote
Kerry
saying
The
race
for
the
White
House
should
be
about
leadership
and
leadership
requires
that
one
help
heal
the
wounds
of
Vietnam
not
reopen
them
that
one
help
identify
the
positive
things
that
we
learned
about
ourselves
and
about
our
Nation
not
play
to
the
divisions
and
differences
of
that
crucible
of
our
generation
We
do
not
need
to
divide
America
over
who
served
and
how.Of
course
he
said
this
in
1992
when
Republicans
were
questioning
what
Bill
Clinton
did
during
Vietnam
I
guess
dividing
America
is
okay
now
If
George
Bush
wants
to
ask
me
questions
about
that
through
his
surrogates
he
owes
America
an
explanation
about
whether
or
not
he
showed
up
for
duty
in
the
National
Guard
Prove
it
That's
what
we
ought
to
have
I'm
not
going
to
stand
around
and
let
them
play
games.Again
that
was
Senator
Kerry
In
fact
he's
so
proud
of
that
quote
that
I
found
it
on
his
website
The
move
by
the
Kerry
campaign
and
the
DNC
to
make
Bush's
service
an
issue
lead
me
to
believe
that
these
documents
may
have
been
forged
by
someone
affiliated
with
the
Democrats
Perhaps
the
CBS
story
was
supposed
to
be
the
opening
salvo
of
this
attack
After
all
the
timing
of
the
new
Fortunate
Son
criticism
of
the
president's
record
seems
suspiciously
close
to
the
60
Minutes
piece
I'm
sure
it's
just
coincidental
though
The
same
type
of
coincidence
perhaps
that
allows
a
document
created
in
1973
to
have
the
same
font
semi-kerning
and
leading
of
an
MS
Word
document
created
in
2004
Now
that
the
memos
have
been
discredited
CBS
should
come
clean
and
admit
where
they
got
them
Someone
tried
to
influence
a
national
election
using
fake
documents
smearing
the
military
service
of
a
sitting
president
America
deserves
to
know

attempted
it

Another
Victim
The
CBS
forgery
scandal
has
claimed
another
victim
although
this
one
is
decidedly
new
media
Andrew
Sullivan
has
long
believed
in
the
power
of
blogs
It's
his
blog
that
likely
inspired
many
of
us
including
me
to
begin
and
maintain
blogs
One
would
think
he'd
be
all
over
this
story
since
it
originated
on
the
internet
His
response
to
the
story
has
been
a
virtual
shrug
But
if
they
are
forgeries
and
the
forgers
are
in
any
way
connected
to
the
Kerry
campaign
then
they
really
could
be
devastating
to
Kerry's
campaign
My
gut
tells
me
they're
probably
genuine
and
if
they
were
forgeries
I
don't
see
why
the
White
House
would
also
send
them
out
But
we'll
see
won't
we?He
later
repeats
the
we'll
see
won't
we
phrase
and
condescendingly
says
it's
good
for
the
Bush
wing
of
the
blogosphere
to
keep
asking
questions
It's
not
too
hard
to
see
why
the
fallen
king
is
so
blase
about
this
story
For
one
it
hurts
Bush
critics
a
group
that
Sullivan
has
joined
in
the
past
few
months
Two
it's
not
his
story
and
there's
probably
a
measure
of
jealousy
there
Still
Sullivan's
reaction
proves
that
his
antipathy
to
Bush
has
clouded
his
ability
to
think
independently
It's
a
measure
of
how
far
he's
fallen
that
a
major
trailblazer
in
the
new
media
universe
trusts
a
99
discredited
old

story
because
he
wants

I
don't
want
to
engage
in
too
much
hyperbole
but
this
is
huge
for

Not

have
they
corrected
a
story
in
the
old
media
they've
done
it
in
less
than
24
hours
and
were
able
to
do
a
more
thorough
job
of
vetting
the
documents
than
CBS
News
CNN
MSNBC
ABC

and
the
Washington

CBS
credibility
is
in
serious
question
Ace
even
has
a
Dan
Rather
Retirement
Watch
The
media
has
done
itself
some
serious
damage
this
election
season
I
think
CBS
actions
have
ended
the
usefulness
of
the
Bush
AWOL
story
which
may
actually
be
a
public
service
The
Kerry
campaign
has
to
be
sweating
this
story
out
as
it
will
reflect
badly
on
them
If
this
can
be
traced
back
in
any
way
to
Kerry
which
I
seriously
doubt
no
one's
that
stupid
his
campaign
will
be
hurt
Forging
documents
to
try
and
bring
dishonor
on
the
National
Guard
service
of
a
president
is
a
dirty
trick
the
Nixon
administration
could
only
dream
about
Dan
Rather

not
a
well-liked
reporter
If
other
members
of
the
major

can
somehow
prove
that
Gunga
Dan
depended
on
forged
documents
to
back
up
allegations
by
a
Kerry
partisan
they
will
go
after
him
The
media
is
a
competitive
business
and
anything
goes
Ace
may
not
be
too
far
off
the
mark
with
his
predictions
if
the
documents
are
proved
to
be
forgeries
or
if
CBS
retracts
the
original
story
Dan
Rather
will
likely
decide
he's
been

business
long
enough
Like

anytime

Given

Remember
your
first
day
of
school
In
the
schools
I
attended
there
was
always
a
beginning
of
the
school
year
assembly
where
we
met
our
principal
and
teachers
Sometimes
we'd
sing
some
songs
usually
of
the
patriotic
variety
and
someone
would
always
bring
gifts
for
a
teacher
There
was
laughter
and
nervousness
fear
and
excitement
The
first
day
of
school
Like
Americans
Russian
children
had
an
assembly
on
the
first
day
of
school
Some
had
brought
flowers
for
their
teachers
most
were
likely
wearing
their
best
clothes
as
to
make
a
good
impression
Old
friends
were
greeted
summer
stories
were
exchanged
Questions
were
asked
there
that
are
asked
in
every
school
across
the
world
What's
the
teacher
like
Who
will
I
sit
next
to
in
class
Will
the
tests
be
hard
Will
there
be
much
homework
The
first
day
of
school
Just
outside
the
celebration
a
group
waited
They
heard
the
laughter
of
children
the
high-pitched
singing
They
saw
the
smiles
and
the
trepidation
of
children
who
were
about
to
begin
a
new
academic
year
Did
they
gain
any
satisfaction
in
knowing
they
would
soon
bring
more
fear
to
these
children's
faces
How
hard
did
they
work
at
subordinating
their
humanity
to
their
ideology
Was
it
easy
motivating
oneself
to
point
guns
at
the
innocent
and
brutally
kill
children
Did
they
pray
to
their
god
for
the
strength
to
do
evil
The
children
of
Belsan
lost
their
humanity
to
appease
a
wrong
idea
of
god
They
became
pawns
to
a
cause
and
a
sacrifice
to
appease
a
hatred
that
could
only
be
quenched
with
the
blood
of
enemies
Children
were
shot
or
knifed
for
requesting
a
drink
of
water
Children
were
raped
as
a
form
of
entertainment
Adults
were
killed
for
standing
up
to
their
captors
Civilization
became
an
afterthought
a
hindrance
There
are
those
in
this
country
who
believe
one
can
negotiate
with
those
who
commit
such
acts
The
men
running
for
president
from
Massachusetts
and
North
Carolina
believe
that
words
can
appease
the
evil
that
causes
people
to
shoot
children
in
the
back
as
they
run
away
Many
of
their
supporters
believe
that
somehow
the
west
is
responsible
for
terrorism
What
did
the
children
of
Belsan
do
to
deserve
death
Perhaps
Ted
Rall
Susan
Sontag
and
Noam
Chomsky
should
visit
Belsan
and
try
to
explain
how
terrorism
is
really
the
fault
of
those
terrorized
not
those
who
wield
the
gun
or
trigger
the
bomb
Regale
us
with
your
sophisticated-sounding
theories
and
try
to
explain
away
the
slaughter
of
children
by
those
who
want
nothing
less
than
the
fall
of
Western
civilization
Putin's
Chechnya
policy
is
not
wise
but
it
does
it
warrant
such
a
bloody
and
inhuman
response
The
children
of
Belsan
are
the
latest
victims
in
a
war
that
John
Kerry
and
his
supporters
refuse
to
acknowledge
Islamic
terrorists
helped
plan
and
carry
out
the
horrors
of
Belsan
Radical
Islamic
ideologies
motivated
them
If
it
were
possible
those
same
terrorists
would
have
carried
out
an
attack
on
schools
in
Bangor
Maine
or
Beeville
Texas
The
location
means
nothing
The
victims
are
chosen
at
random
The
only
thing
that
matters
is
the
terror
and
the
killing
This
is
a
war
We
just
received
another
reminder
of
why
it's
essential
that
we
win
it
If
I
have
a
message
this
Wictory
Wednesday
it's

accordingly

Slanderers

if

It's

that

a
pampered
life
As
a
liberal
in
Massachusetts
he's
never
been
questioned
about
his

challenged
on

Anyone
who
attempts
to
examine
his

is
accused
of
questioning
his
patriotism
or
reminded
of
his
combat
tours
in
Vietnam
For

Kerry
has
skated
on

aided

Kerry's
Diplomacy
Senator
John
Kerry
has
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
the
campaign
trail
trying
to
convince
people
to
elect
him
president
because
he
would
restore
the
world's
faith
in
America
His
major
claim
is
that
everyone
hates
us
and
it's
George
W
Bush's
fault
because
the
president
is
a
reckless
cowboy
who
led
us
into
war
against
the
wishes
of
the
world
and
now
you
can't
even
get
decent
service
at

Paris
cafe
if
you're
an
American
anymore
On
the
campaign
trail
Kerry
has
done
little
to
prove
his
superior
diplomatic
skills
Consider
his
descriptions
of
our
allies
The
greatest
position
of
strength
is
by
exercising
the
best
judgement
in
the
pursuit
of
diplomacy...not
in
some
trumped-up
so-called
coalition
of
the
bribed
the
coerced
the
bought
and
the
extorted
but
in
a
genuine
coalition
the
coalition
is]the
phoniest
thing
I

We

can't

The
new
conventional
wisdom
is
that
it
was
the
sheer
meanness
of
the

earned
them
the
bounce
and
so
Kerry's
hitting
back
saying
he's
not
going

be
criticised
by
a
President
and
Vice-President
who
weren't

If

didn't

can't
criticise
John

On
the

hand
if
you
did

and
you
criticise

Kerry
that
just

you're

The
President
Not
his
best
speech
but
a
very
good
speech
The
laundry
list
was
a
bit
hard
to
sit
through
but
necessary
The
last
few
paragraphs
were
moving
optimistic
and
showed
that
Bush
is
focused
on
the
future
not
the
past
Compare
Bush's
speech
tonight
with
John
Kerry's
unprecedented
and
rather
pathetic
pep
rally
Kerry
is
still
defending
his
service
of
30
years
ago
from
the
attacks
he
sees
behind
every
criticism
while
at
the
same
time
tearing
Bush
and
Cheney
apart
for
things
they
did
in
the
60s
and
70s
The
man
has
a
glass
jaw
and
a
tin
ear
and
if
he
continues
in
this
vein
he
will
lose
this
election
Which
of
course
would
be
a
good
thing
Kerry
is
so
focused
on
himself
as
a
war
hero
that
he's
forgotten
the
purpose
of
a
campaign
is
to
tell
people
who
you
are
not
who
you
were
A
campaign
should
be
focused
on
what
you'll
do
not
what
you
did
and
should
be
about
what
you
believe
now
not
what
you
accomplished
then
John
Kerry
is
a
terrible
candidate
and
would
make
a
terrible
president
Hopefully
Bush's
speech
tonight
convinced
undecideds
that
Bush
deserves
a
second
term
I
think
Bush
will
get
a
bounce
from
this
convention
and
Kerry
will
lose
support
from
those
who
realize
that
the
senator
is
not
a
serious
man
despite
the
serious
times
Other
more
random
thoughts
Whoever
was
in
charge
of
security
at
Madison
Square
Garden
should
be
fired
then
boxed

the
ears
TWO
protesters
were
able
to
interrupt
the
president's
speech
George
Pataki
isn't
a
good
speaker
Henceforth
he
shall
be
called
Clicheman
Slayer
of
Rhetoric
Yes
I'm
tired
The
media
is
shameful
the
comments
after
the
president
spoke
were
all
basically
Democrat
talking
points
Dan
Rather
especially
is
a
crapweasel
I
always
feel
sorry
for
the
poor
guy
who
has
to
clean
all
the
balloons
and
confetti
UPDATE
AGAIN
What
the
is
John
Kerry
thinking
The
president
didn't
campaign
at
all
during
the
Democratic
National
Convention
Kerry
didn't
show
the
same
restraint
and
is
now
insulting
the
president
Now
that
the
president
has
finally
finished
his
speech
This
guy
is
a
bigger
jerk
than
I'd
even
imagined
If
Bush
doesn't
get
a
bounce
from
the
convention
he's
going
to
get
one
thanks
to
the
lack
of
decorum
shown
by
Kerry
and
Edwards
The
rally
was
a
mistake
full
of
stupid
comments
Really
Not
Compassionate
Criminy
and
ungraciousness
If
this
is
the
result
of
the
Kerry
campaign
staff
shakeup
then
the
Dem
bench
is
extremely
shallow
The
rally

Definitely
the
R
Convention
After
all
how
many
times
during
the
Democratic
convention
did
you
see
reporters
concerned
about
the
lack
of
pro-life
Democrats
When
the
Republicans
meet
though
the
reporters
are
motivated
to
actually
find
stories
instead
of
just
sitting
on
their
posteriors
and
rewriting
press
releases
The
BDN
titled
the
story
GOP's
Tolerance
Tested
By
my
count
there
have
been
at
least
two
or
three
pro-choice
and
pro-gay
marriage
speakers
at
the
Republican
convention
so
far
There
were
zero
pro-life
speakers
at
the
Democrat
convention
Remember
Bob
Casey
The
media
allows
the
left
to
exclusively
claim
the
mantle
of
tolerance
even
though
they
are
the
creators
of
speech
codes
haters
of
Christianity
and
allow
no
one
who
deviates
from
leftist
doctrine
to
speak
during
their
convention

I

Instead

took

Unlike

Arnold
actually
has
credibility
when
he
speaks
on
issues
of
economics
national

and
the

That
credibility
doesn't
come
from

Sullivan
or
Moore
The
fallen
king
is
back
from
vacation
and
blogging
about
the
convention
The
vacation
doesn't
seem
to
have
done
Sullivan
any
good
whatsoever
as
he's
more
shrill
and
angry
than
before
Which
gave
me
an
idea
for
a
game
Read
the
following
quotes
and
see
if
you
can
figure
out
whether
they're
from
Mr
Sullivan
or
from
hate-monger
Michael
Moore
Have
fun
But
comparing
well-meaning
advocates
for
including
gay
people
in
their
own
families
as
the
equivalent
of
Nazis
is
just
well
sadly
typical
of
what
the
GOP
is
fast
becoming
it
is
surely
naive
to
believe
that
the
Bush
campaign
was
unaware
of
the
Swift
Boat
Vets
and
that
their
Texas
cronies
didn't
help
finance
and
produce
the
ads
If
this
had
never
occurred
on
Bush's
watch
before
you
might
dismiss
it
But
obviously
it
is
an
old
tactic
he
deploys
whenever
he
needs
to
For
a
president
who
never
served
in
Vietnam
to
get
his
cronies
to
lambaste
an
opponent
who
actually
put
his
life
in
danger
was
well
breathtakingly
bold
And
you
really
have
to
hand
it
to
Bush
He
knows
how
to
campaign
hard
to
deploy
smears
of
opponents
indirectly
to
stoke
fears
of
minorities
to
rally
votes
and
every
other
hardball
tactic
I
wish
I
could
get
all
huffy
about
this
but
it's
always
been
Bush's
campaign
mojo
divide
smear
and
beam
The
Dixiecrats
meet
again
in
New
York
Now
they're
called
Republicans."Figured
it
out
yet
Well
here's
the
answer...they're
all
Sullivan
Yes
that's
how
far
the
former
conservative
has
fallen
He's
supposedly
for
the
war
against
people
who
would
and
still
do
kill
homosexuals
but
hates
the
man
who
will
actually
fight
it
He's
supposedly
for
limited
government
but
wants
the
courts
to
change
a
millenia-old
insitution
The
president's
support
for
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
seems
to
have
driven
Sullivan
completely
mad
The
man
is
no
longer
rational
It's
all
about
his
emotions
his
feelings
and
his
rights
Who
needs
political
arguments
when
you've
got
invective
and

Cleland's
Nonsense
Senator
John
Kerry
sent
two
Vietnam
vets
to
Crawford
Texas
today
to
deliver
a
letter
to
the
president
asking
him
to
denounce
the
Swift
Boat
Vets
for
truth
Here's
a
quote
from
the
Fox
News
story
Cleland
told
reporters
after
visiting
the
president's
ranch
that
the
swift
boat
issue
is
causing
veterans
to
relive
Vietnam
all
over
again
That
is
not
what
we
ought
to
be
doing
in
America
We
can
do
better
than
that
we
can't
let
these
attacks
continue."I
know
it's
not
nice
to
speak
ill
of
the
disabled
but
what
a
nutjob
It
was
Kerry
that
brought
up
Vietnam
as
a
campaign
issue
with
his
vainglorious
and
self-serving
references
to
his
service
in
the
war
both
on
the
campaign
trail
and
at
the
Democratic
Convention
The
Kerry
campaign
logic
seems
to
be
that
Vietnam
can
only
be
raised
by
them
as
a
campaign
issue
and
only
if
the
stories
help
Kerry
Any
other
use
of
Vietnam
is
an
attack
on
Kerry's
patriotism
Perhaps
the
Senator
should
have
thought
of
that
before
making
Vietnam
the
central
focus
of
his
presidential
campaign
About
the
only
thing
Kerry
has
done
right
in
his
campaign
strategy
is
count
on
the
media
to
treat
him
with
kid
gloves
It's
been
two
weeks
since
he
has
had
a
press
availability
If
Bush
tried
that
the
press
would
hold
a
countdown
and
mention
it
in
every
story
So
far
no
such
tactics
with
Kerry
At
this
point
even
the
pretense
of
objectivity
would
be
preferable
to
what's
going
on

Hey

Help

The

story
says
a
lot
more
about
the

than
it
does
about

The
New

the
Washington

all
running

with
this
headline
Bush

Sounds
bad

Until

find
out
that
it's
happening
with

as
well
So
where's
the
big

trumpeting
this
little
factoid
The
law
firm
of
Perkins
Coie
represents
the
Kerry
campaign
and
Robert
Bauer
an
election
lawyer
at
the
firm
represents
the
anti-Bush
527
group
America
Coming
Together
which
has
been
mobilizing
voters
for
Kerry
Ginsberg
said
that
Joseph
Sandler
is
a
lawyer
for
both
the
Democratic
National
Committee
and
for
the
independent

MoveOn.org
which
has
run
advertisements
attacking

where's
the
big
headlines
trumpeting
the
fact
that
not
one
but
TWO
Democrat
lawyers
are
doing
the
same
thing
This
story
has
me
angry
Bias
is
one

the
headlines
are
propaganda
meant
to
hurt
one
campaign

Don't

Some
journalists
are
asking
whether
the
Swift
Boat
story
has
gone
on
too
long
Quote
What
I've
heard
from
colleagues
is
that
people
feel
it
probably
has
had
too
long
a
life
said
Frank
James
a
Chicago
Tribune
reporter
We
wish
someone
would
put
a
stake
in
this
vampire
For
most
reporters
finding
out
that
a
candidate
for
president
has
lied
about
his
official
biography
would
be
a
story
with
legs
and
the
coverage
would
be
defined
not
by
the
miniscule
attention
span
of
reporters
but
by
the
willingness
of
the
candidate
to
deal
with
the
issue
In
other
words
the
longer
a
candidate
went
without
addressing
it
the
longer
the
story
would
last
On
a
big
story
reporters
would
be
doing
their
own
homework
finding
their
own
sources
and
writing
stories
based
on
actual...you
know...REPORTING
On
this
one
they
are
content
to
simply
write
he
said/he
said
stories
about
the
controversy
without
doing
any
actual
work
They've
done
it
before
on
stories
such
as
cocaine

Enron
National

Mainstream
journalists
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
Almost
three
weeks
after
John
Kerry's
Christmas
in
Cambodia
story
broke
it
was
Jon
Stewart
of
Comedy
Central's
Daily
Show
that
finally
asked
the
Senator
point-blank
whether
he
was
ever
in
Cambodia
Kerry
declined
to
answer
the
question
The
press
has
been
covering
for
John
Kerry
and
tyring
to
tear
down
his
critics
since
the
story
first
appeared
on
the
internet
At
the
same
time
they
are
obediently
repeating
every
charge
against
President
Bush's
National
Guard
service
taking
their
cues
from
Wes
Clark
and
Michael
Moore
It's
an
amazing
time
just
when
you
think
the
press
can't
get
any
lower
they
jettison
more
credibility
in
an
attempt
to
keep
the
Kerry
campaign
from
sinking
The
media
has
refused
to
question
Kerry
about
his
Cambodian
adventures
or
his
ever-shifting
views
on
the
war
The
media
has
not
called
for
Kerry
to
denounce
any
of
the
liberal
527
ads
that
have
been
run
against
the
president
They
are
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
publicity
arm
of
the
Kerry
campaign
The
president
will
only
get
his
message
out
with
paid
media
and
he
needs
funds
to
do
it
Support
the
president

Shut
Up
and
Sing
Month
Alice
Cooper
has
inspired
me
now
there's
a
phrase
my
parents
probably
didn't
want
to
see
on
this
blog
In
the
past
few
months
we've
seen
those
in
the
entertainment
industry
use
their
clout
and
money
to
criticize
the
president
and
attempt
to
get
John
Kerry
elected
Nonsensical
political
statements
are
normal
for
the
entertainment
elite
but
there
has
never
to
my
knowledge
been
such
a
concerted
effort
by
so
many
celebrities
to
defeat
one
president
using
such
hateful
rhetoric
The
most
maddening
thing
about
the
entertainment
elite
is
that
they
seem
to
have
a
terrible
opinion
of
those
who
have
made
them
rich
and
famous
Namely
you
and
me
With
every
compact
disc
you
buy
or
movie
you
see
you
enrich
those
who
hate
everything
you
stand
for
and
hate
the
man
who
currently
sits
in
the
Oval
Office
Granted
not
all
celebrities
feel
this
way
but
enough
of
them
do
to
make
me
wonder
why
I
continue
to
support
them
For
that
reason
I
think
it's
time
to
organize
In
the
spirit
of
Laura
Ingraham
I
would
like
to
propose
January
2005
as
Shut
Up
and
Sing
month
Why
January
2005
Because
I
want
the
word
to
be
spread
far
and
wide
I
want
as
many
people
to
participate
as
possible
Participation
is
simple
Don't
buy
anything
from
the
entertainment
elite
in
that
entire
month
No
CDs
no
DVDs
no
movie
tickets
Nothing
Show
them
the
power
of
the
marketplace
and
remind
them
who
gave
them
all
they
have
in
the
first
place
This
is
not
intended
to
silence
them
completely
everyone
has
the
freedom
to
say
what
they
want
about
any
politician
in
office
It's
simply
a
way
to
tell
them
not
to
alienate
their
audience
in
order
to
please
their
powerful
friends
and
request
that
they
maintain
civility
in
their
political
discourse
No
one
likes
a
bully
and
the
entertainment
elite
has
become
just
that
They
constantly
use
their
power
and
money
to
spread
venom
and
lies
about
Republicans
and
conservatives
When
conservatives
complain
we
are
likened
to
censors
and
puritans
It's
old
and
the
only
way
we
can
stop
it
is
through
the
power
of
the
marketplace
So
spread
the
word

Yes

frankly
it

Jim
Rassmann

Yes

the

just

Kerry
followed
up
four
months

personal
courage
with
two
decades
of
political
cowardice
He
has
no
major
legislative
accomplishments
often
takes
whatever

politically
expedient

let's
not

his

Kerry

NIMBY
The
Democrats
have
made
a
lot
of
noise
this
election
year
about
the
need
to
fund
first
responders
such
as
firefighters
and
police
officers
The
fact
that
most
of
these
guys
belong
to
unions
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
concern
I'm
sure
In
the
overwhelmingly
Democrat
town
of
Orono
Maine
the
attitude
seems
to
be
fund
the
first
responders
but
don't
let
them
train
or
anything
The
owner
of
a
facility
being
used
by
the
National
Guard
and
others
to
train
for
a
terrorist
attack
wants
to
put
a
video
surveillance
system
on
the
property
to
protect
it
Orono
residents
a
paranoid
lot
see
the
system
as
a
Big
Brother
intrusion
on
their
personal
freedom
and
will
doubtless
blame
the
whole
thing
on
John
Ashcroft
eventually
Seriously
though
if
a
highly
Democrat
and
liberal
place
like
the
People's
Republic
of
Orono
doesn't
like
the
idea
of
letting
first
responders
have
a
place
to
train
what's
the
point
of
giving
them
additional
funding
To
make
ourselves
feel
better
Of
course
the
entire
idea
of
funding
first
responders
while
voting
against
funding
those
who
keep
the
terrorist
attacks
from
happening
in
the
first
place
paging
John
Kerry
is
ridiculous
We
should
always
be
prepared
to
deal
with
the
aftermath
of
a
terrorist
attack
but
should
focus
more
of

John

will
join

in
criticizing
Bush's
troop
redeployment
plan
He
says
the
plan
will
alienate

needed

fight
the

on

Of

the

in

are

this
seems
yet
another

Status
Quo
Candidate
Last
summer
I
was
in
rural
Russia
I
drove
through
the
countryside
ate
with
Russian
families
and
participated
in
an
Americans
versus
the
Russians
volleyball
game
I
can
say
with
some
assurance
that
the
Russians
have
no
plans
to
invade
Western
Europe
So
I
was
not
surprised
at
all
by
President
Bush's
announcement
yesterday
of
a
major
troop
realignment
around
the
world
to
prepare
for
future
conflicts
instead
of
waiting
around
for
a
war
with
Russia
that
won't
happen
The
campaign
of
John
Kerry
in
full
anything
Bush
says
is
wrong
mode
disagrees
as
National
Review's
Kerry
Spot
points
out
today
Richard

a
line
sure
to
be
in
future
campaign
ads
against
Kerry
complains
that
the
Germans
are
very
unhappy
about
these
withdrawals
When
combined
with
Kerry's
decision
to
make
his
four
months
in
Vietnam
the
focus
of
his
candidacy
these
criticisms
cement
Kerry's
status
as
the
candidate
who
has
no
idea
how
to
deal
with
the
challenges
of
the
modern
world
His
campaign
is
focused
entirely
on
the
past
on
fighting
past
wars
and
coddling
past
allies
at
the
expense
of
taking
a
hard
look
at
the
threat
terrorism
poses
to
the
United
States
Kerry's
nostalgia
trips
through
the
1970s
are
more
than
irritating
they
are
dangerous
This
is
not
a
man
who
is
serious
about
protecting
American
interests
against
current
threats
Hanging
out
with
war
buddies
and
saving
a
guy's
life

years
ago

not

make
Reporters

stop
carrying
water
for
the
Senator
and
push
him
to
give
specific
reasons
why
this
troop
realignment
is
not
a
good
idea
Or
maybe
Kerry
and
his
advisors
could
offer
their
own

Good
cartoon
on
Kerry's
positive
campaign
If
Kerry's
first
instinct
is
to
jump
straight
into
the
politics
of
personal
destruction
then
this
story
will
hurt
him
overall
as
The
Truth
Laid
Bear
is
predicting
He's
invested
far
too
much
into
the
band
of
brothers
image
to
start
tearing
apart
fellow
veterans
now
For
many
in
that
generation
the
wounds
of
what
Kerry
did
after
returning
from
the
war
are
still
fresh
and
the
latest
attempt
to
defame
fellow
vets
may
not
sit
well
with
those
who
remember
the
war
I
still
think
it
was
dumb
for
Kerry
to
focus
so
exclusively
on
his
Vietnam
service
leaving
that
service
open
for
examination
Maybe
he
figured
quite
correctly
that
the

would
cover
for
him
If
so
then
he's
savvier
than
I
would
have
given
him
credit
for
being
Like
Instapundit
is
predicting
though
the

will
have
a
huge
price
to
pay
for
protecting
Kerry
through
mishap
after

With

they
already
have
I
simply
do
not
believe
what
I
read
in
the
papers
or
see
on

websites
any
more
And
I'm
probably
not
the
only

Overall
though
my
earlier
points
about
Kerry
and
Vietnam
still
stand
I
want
to
know
what
a

candidate
will
do
in

Wictory
Wednesday
This
week
for
the
first
time
since
2000
I
sat
down
and
wrote
a
check
to
a
presidential
campaign
The
almost-total
absence
of
the
Christmas
in
Cambodia
story
in
the
major
media
shows
the
extent
to
which
reporters
and
editors
want
President
Bush
to
lose
this
election
The
media
were
willing
to
expend
time
and
money
to
investigate
every
angle
of
the
Bush
AWOL
story
earlier
this
year
on
the
suggestion
of
Michael
Moore
and
Terry
MacAuliffe
but
haven't
lifted
a
finger
to
look
at
the
Kerry
story
despite
having
over
200
sources
available
to
disprove
the
Senator's
claims
of
being
in
Cambodia
John
Kerry
is
most
likely
lying
about
this
story
and
the
media
are
refusing
to
call
him
on
it
The
economy
is
improving
slowly
and
the
media
won't
report
it
Good
things
are
happening
in
Iraq
and
the
media
ignore
it
The
media
can
no
longer
be
counted
on
to
do
their
jobs
so
President
Bush
is
now
forced
to
spend
campaign
money
to
tell
his
own
story
That's
where
your
help
is
needed
We
can't
change
the
media
yet
but
we
can
allow
the
president
to
tell
the
American
people
the
truth
about
his
presidency
Give
to
the
Bush
campaign
today
Volunteering
is
great
but
what
the
president
really
needs
is
the
money
to
get
the
message
out
Any
donation
will
help
win
this
vital
fight
John
Kerry
cannot
be
president
of
this
country
As
Hugh
Hewitt
has
repeatedly
said
the
Democrats
have
to
lose
and
lose
badly
And
with
the
capitulation
of
the
major
media
it
seems
we're
the
only
people
who
can
tell

about
the
danger
that

Kerry
for

From
Hugh
Hewitt's

this
week
Kerry
told
the
Kansas
City
Star
that
he
would
have
voted
for
the
Missouri
amendment
that
limited
marriage
to
one
man
and
one
woman
which
passed
overwhelmingly
on
Tuesday
71
to
29
Kerry
did
say
that
he
would
have
voted
for
Amendment
2
the
constitutional
amendment
banning
gay
marriage
that
passed
overwhelmingly
Tuesday
He
said
that
Massachusetts
passed
the
same
type
of
amendment
a
few
years
ago
and
that
he
supported
it..."Where's

waiting

Commission
Where
are
the
press
releases
Where
is
the
outrage
I
have
a
feeling
I'll
be
waiting
awhile
The
absence
of
outrage
suggests
Kerry's
supporters
know
exactly
where
the
Senator
stands
on
gay
marriage
and
feel
confident
enough
to
keep
quiet
about
it
John
Kerry
is
a
supporter
of
gay
marriage
who
doesn't
want
to
admit
it
lest
he
lose
those
votes
down
south
and
in
the
midwest
So
instead
of
standing
on
principle
he'll
lie
about
his

and
make
those
who

Bush

angrily
paging

When

Hamilton
gave

a

asked
How

Did

thought
of

Hamilton
today

read

tried

reassure

that
his
prescriptions

are
paying
off
in

could

Vietnam
Again

on
the
new
ad
from

Frankly
I
think
it
is
stupid
for

to
focus
so
much
on
his

in
Vietnam
as
a
way
to
bolster

His

was
full
of
such

was
weakened
by
them
The

will
likely
tear
these

apart
and
accuse
them
of
being
motivated
by
hatred
for
Kerry
funny
that
the
one

who
served
with
Kerry
and
now
supports
him
is
never
questioned
on

For
people
of

who
were

ended
or

in

just
don't

Why
Bush
Will
Win
Zev
Chafets
writing
in
the
New
York
Daily
News
offers
his
opinion
of
why
the
president
will
walk
with
re-election
Personally
I
still
think
it
might
be
a
close
race
but
have
seen
real
weakness
in
the
Kerry
campaign
of
late
His
convention
was
terrible
it
was
dominated
by
the
anti-Bush
left
and
Kerry's
speech
was
their
red
meat
As
Chafets
says
in
his
article
not
everyone
hates
Bush
as
much
as
the
left
thinks
they
do
But
if
Kerry
keeps
doing
stupid
things
like
his
Wendy's
stunt
they
will
begin
to
hate
the
Dem
nominee
If
you
want
to
guarantee
a
Bush
victory
then
volunteer
for
and
donate
to
his
reelection
campaign
Then
VOTE
for
Bush
and
encourage
your
friends
to
do
the
same

Kerry's
Speech
I
didn't
get
a
chance
to
watch
Kerry's
speech
on
Thursday
evening
as
I
was
in
New
Hampshire
watching
Steven
Curtis
Chapman
in
concert
I
think
I
picked
the
right
place
to
be
I
have
since
read
the
speech
and
am
unimpressed
Kerry
did
nothing
to
bolster
his
national-security
credentials
other
than
tell
war
stories
He
sounded
more
like
a
guy
at
the
local
VFW
hall
reminiscing
with
his
buddies
than
a
presidential
candidate
His
plans
are
vague
to
say
the
least
We
know
what
we
have
to
do
in
Iraq
We
need
a
President
who
has
the
credibility
to
bring
our
allies
to
our
side
and
share
the
burden
reduce
the
cost
to
American
taxpayers
and
reduce
the
risk
to
American
soldiers
That's
the
right
way
to
get
the
job
done
and
bring
our
troops
home
Here
is
the
reality
that
won't
happen
until
we
have
a
president
who
restores
America's
respect
and
leadership
so
we
don't
have
to
go
it
alone
in
the
world
And
we
need
to
rebuild
our
alliances
so
we
can
get
the
terrorists
before
they
get
us.My
question
is
simple
how
With
the
vaunted
Kerry
charm
Kerry
is
blaming
President
Bush
for
alienating
our
allies
but
has
no
real
plan
to
bring
those
allies
of
which
he
speaks
France
and
Germany
on
board
with
the
war
on
terrorism
His
campaign
promises
here
are
not
based
on
anything
other
than
hope
conjecture
and
a
massive
ego
Kerry
seems
to
believe
that
his
mere
presence
will
somehow
convince
people
of
the
rightness
of
our
cause
Don't
be
fooled
France
and
Germany
don't
want
to
be
part
of
the
war
on
terror
becasue
they
were
benefitting
from
the
status
quo
They
are
no
longer
allies
to
be
quite
frank
about
it
It's
one
thing
for
allies
to
disagree
about
the
correct
course
of
action
in
dealing
with
a
threat
It's
another
thing
for
them
to
actively
work
against
our
national
security
interests
to
protect
their
economic
ones
Simply
put
Kerry's
speech
insulted
the
allies
that
are
with
us
in
the
hopes
of
impressing
those
who
have
made
themselves
our
opponents
Not
a
great
start
for
the
guy
who's
claiming
to
be
more
diplomatic
than
the
current

So
Long
Suckers
Andrew
Sullivan
has
completed
his
journey
After
months
of
increasingly
negative
comments
about
George
W
Bush
Sullivan
has
finally
endorsed
John
Kerry
as
the
conservative
candidate
in
the
race
for
president
I
only
learned
about
this
from
the
corner
as
I
no

read
Sullivan's
blog
his
anti-Christian
bigotry
finally
grew
too
shrill
to
take
For
one
who
lectures
on
the
need
for
tolerance
he
shows
darn
little
of
it
himself
I
think
Sullivan
is
done
despite
his
attempts
to
cater
to
the
donation
dollars
of
the
left
His
real
base
of
support
was
from
conservatives
who
liked
his
message
and
his
stance
on
the
war
and
social
issues
Liberals
are
not

flock

his...well
whatever
the
heck
he
calls
himself
these

His

views
are
not

they're
incomprehensible
JunkYardBlog

it

Sullivan
has
subordinated
his
ideology
to
his
identity
with
sad
results
Sullivan
is
simply
no
longer
a
serious
person
Kerry
as
the
conservative
candidate
His
rationale
reeks
of
desperation
he's
trying
to
justify
in
any
possible
way
he
can
with
no
solid
ground
to
stand
on
his
desire
to
vote

And
why
For

reason
he

Dem
Divisions
This
is
a
sick
party
According
to
this
article
the
Democrats
have
little
holding
them
together
save
a
shared
hatred
for
President
Bush
and
a
desire
to
see
him
beat
not
a
desire
to
see
John
Kerry
win
It
seems
the
party's
standard
bearer
disagrees
with
a
large
number
of
Democrats
on
the
issues
but
that
doesn't
matter
It's
all
about
beating
Bush
Should
by
some
miracle
Kerry
win
the
presidency
he
will
have
no
mandate
to
lead
If
voters
elect
Kerry
it
will
be
because
they
are
unhappy
with
the
incumbent
not
because
they
have
any
positive
feelings
toward
the
challenger
The
United
States
is
in
the
middle
of
a
war
with
people
who
want
to
see
us
dead
This
is
no
time
to
elect
a
president
with
no
ideas
no
mandate
and
no
ability
to
rally
the
populace
behind
him
Kerry
would
be
a
terrible
president
crippled
by
his
own
inability
to
think
beyond
his
own
self-interest
In
short
he's
a
weak
man
and
this
is
no
time
for
weak
men
The
Democrats
are
endangering
the
national
security
of
this
country
in
their
desire
to
retake
power
They
deserve
to
be
crushed
in

and

do
what's

to

them

the

remains
what
is

Saddam
Wasn't
THAT
Bad
After
the
complete
meltdown
of
Joe
Wilson
the
liberals
have
had
to
scramble
for
a
new
reason
to
discredit
the
war
Kevin
Drum
seems
to
have
found
one
In
a
nutshell
he
seems
to
be
saying
that
yes
Saddam
was
a
bad
guy
but
Bush
and
Blair
overestimated
the
number
of
people
he
killed
and
put
in
mass
graves
Therefore
along
with
the
missing
WMD's
and
other
such
stuff
the
war
was
ultimately
a
mistake
and
BUSH
LIED
It's
a
bit
sad
that
liberals
have
come
to
the
point
where
they're
quibbling
over
the
exact
numbers
of
people
buried
in

graves
Shouldn't
the
fact
that
such
graves
exist
be
enough
to
prove
that
Saddam
was
a
monster
and
needed
to
be
removed
from
power
It
seems
the
Anybody
But
Bush
crowd
is
even
willing
to
give
a
mass
murderer
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
over
the

Asking
the
Wrong
Question
The
Bangor
Daily
News
looks
at
the
price
of
tax
relief
in
today's
paper
The
reporter
dutifully
interviews
a
few
city
councilors
who
liken
the
proposal
to
fixing
a
computer
with
a
baseball
bat
and
say
it's
an
unsolicited
gift
to
wealthy
landowners
from
away
thus
trying
to
hinge
the
anti-tax
cap
argument
on
two
tired
arguments
class
warfare
and
a
dislike
of
those
from
out
of
state
As
is
typical
with
the
BDN
of
late
no
effort
is
made
to
interview
anyone
who
actually
agrees
with
the
tax
cap
proposal
or
actually
investigate
the
claims
of
the
benefits
to
rich
out-of-state
landowners
It
would
have
taken
a
simple
phone
call
to
the
city
assessor's
office
or
a
quick
Google
search
to
determine
how
much
the
average
Maine
resident
pays
in
property
tax
second
in
the
nation
or
4.8
percent
of
personal
income
A
quick
internet
search
mine
took
less
than
ten
minutes
would
also
give
you
the
numbers
of
how
much
of
that
money
68
municipal
governments
are
forced
to
throw
at
an
ever-growing
educational
system
But
rather
than
do
the
simple
work
that
reporters
are
supposed
to
do
and
present
both
sides
of
a
very
controversial
issue
this
reporter
decided
to
use
reliably
anti-tax
cap
sources
to
paint
a
bleak
future
for
the
city
if
people
are
actually
allowed
to
keep
their
own
money
The
real
question
isn't
the
cost
of
tax
relief
but
the
increasing
costs
and
waste
of
state
government
Maine
residents
want
a
tax
cap
because
they're
angry
Angry
that
DHS
seems
free
to
waste
and
lose
millions
of
dollars
with
no
legislative
action
to
prevent
it
or
punish
those
responsible
Angry
that
while
the
population
of
Maine
has
only
grown
just
over
1.4
in
the
past
decade
and
the
student
population
has
fallen
4
education
spending
has
gone
up
over
50
It's
going
to
take
more
than
class
warfare
rhetoric
and
scare
tactics
to
convince
Mainers
that
the
tax
cap
proposal
is
a
bad
idea
but
I
can
see
why
opponents
are
resorting
to
such
lows
They
don't
have
the
facts
on
their
side
Mainers
are
overtaxed
and
need
a
break
And
in
November
they're
going
to
get
one

Andrew
Sullivan
has
admitted
that
at
times
he's
too
quick
to
lump
all
Christians
in

the

right's
leaders
Despite
my
harsh
words

I
still

from

It's

have
with

at

Unfortunately
Sullivan
is
right
about
many
church
leaders
In
their
fervor
for
the
cause
they've
forgotten
their
calling
which
leads
them
to
make
mistakes
like
Michael

balance
for

get

matters
Some
can
straddle
that
chasm
Others
obviously
cannot

be

I'm
still

figure

might
someday
play

hope
that
the

over

has
taught
some

a
lesson
about

involvement

can
be
perilous
It's

acknowledge
there's

Metallica
Documentary
Fox
News
has
a
rather
glowing
review
of
Monster
a
new
documentary
about
Metallica
I
happen
to
think
some
of
the
band's
earlier
stuff
was
great
but
like
many
fans
was
turned
off
by
their
use
of
lawsuits
against
fans
who
downloaded
music
It
can
be
said
they
started
a
precedent
that
the
RIAA
has
followed
to
this
day
Last
year
album
sales
fell
almost
8
percent
and
music
downloads
were
blamed
Music
sites
like
Kazaa
and
Grokster
probably
are
to
blame
for
some
of
the
decline
but
the
blame
cannot
be
placed
on
them
alone
Much
of
the
problem
lies
in
what
the
music
industry
chooses
to
embrace
in
terms
of
the
artists
it
signs
when
a
bad
bad
singer
like
William
Hung
can
get
a
record
contract
just
because
he's
famous
you
know
the
industry
has
issues
Listen
to
the
radio
sometime
all
of
the
top
40
I
may
be
aging
myself
with
the
use
of
that
term
music
sounds
identical
Every
once
in
awhile
you
get
something
that
sounds
original
but
such
groups
are
few
and
far
between
Perhaps
I'm
a
geezer
but
I
just
don't
want
to
listen
to
the
same
blasted
hip-hop
beat
in
every
song
on
the
radio
There's
got
to
be
something
out
there
that
doesn't
sound
like
a
bad
imitation
of
everything
else
Why
aren't
record
companies
signing
those
artists
What's
happening
with
the
recording
industry
is
really
only
a
part
of
the
larger
problem
in
the
entertainment
industry
No
this
isn't
some
rant
about
Hollywood
liberalism
this
is
a
rant
about
the
sad
state
of
creativity
The
Emmy
nominations
were
announced
yesterday
and
they
are
a
sorry
bunch
Shows
that
are
past
their
prime
such
as
The
West
Wing
won
nominations
while
other
shows
were
ignored
The
miniseries
The
Reagans
which
was
trashed
by
critics
won
three
nominations
proving
that
sometimes
politics
does
trump
quality
okay
there's
the
political
rant
There
are
very
few
must
see
shows
on
television
these
days
I
watch
The
Sopranos
Smallville
24
and
Arrested
Development
regularly
The
multiple
CSI
series
are
good
but
not
fantastic
their
subject
matter
though
makes
them
watchable
The
problem
with
television
is
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
feel
the
need
to
entertain
anymore
West
Wing
is
a
good
example
of
this
Instead
of
using
good
writing
and
plots
to
keep
attention
the
show
relies
on
musical
cues
and
camera
angles
when
we
hear
the
music
swell
we're
supposed
to
feel
something
well
because
that's
what
we've
always
done
when
the
music
swells
Comedy
shows
grow
more
sexual
in
their
content
because
hey
shocking
is
funny
The
movie
industry
is
the
same
way
There
are
some
good
movies
out
there
Spider-Man
2
entertained
while
telling
an
incredibly
emotional
story
but
much
of
what
is
offered
is
dreck
Combine
Hollywood
and
the
recording
industry's
offerings
with
its
insistence
on
alienating
at
least
half
of
its
audience
and
you
have
a
real
problem
And
it's
one
the
celebrities
and
moguls
involved
show
no
sign

wanting

Lewis
Wisdom
Andrew

quoted
Christian
author
C.S
Lewis
today
and
I
think
these
are
words
worth
passing
on
Before
leaving
the
question
of
divorce
I
should
like
to
distinguish
two
things
which
are
very
often
confused
The
Christian
conception
of
marriage
is
one
the
other
is
the
quite
different
question
how
far
Christians
if
they
are
voters
or
Members
of
Parliament
ought
to
try
to
force
their
views
of
marriage
on
the
rest
of
the
community
by
embodying
them
in
the
divorce
laws
A
great
many
people
seem
to
think
that
if
you
are
a
Christian
yourself
you
should
try
to
make
divorce
difficult
for
every
one
I
do
not
think
that
At
least
I
know
I
should
be
very
angry
if
the
Mohammedans
tried
to
prevent
the
rest
of
us
from
drinking
wine
My
own
view
is
that
the
Churches
should
frankly
recognize
that
the
majority
of
the
British
people
are
not
Christians
and
therefore
cannot
be
expected
to
live
Christian
lives
There
ought
to
be
two
distinct
kinds
of
marriage
one
governed
by
the
State
with
rules
enforced
on
all
citizens
the
other
governed
by
the
Church
with
rules
enforced
by
her
on
her
own
members
The
distinction
ought
to
be
quite
sharp
so
that
a
man
knows
which
couples
are
married
in
a
Christian
sense
and
which
are
not."From
Mere
Christianity

Kerry-Edwards
Fox
News
and

are
reporting
that
John
Kerry
has
picked
a
fellow
senator
John
Edwards
to
be
his

Considering

this

Edwards
does

and
a

both
traits

why

Pundits
are

Edwards
showed
no

strength

during

own
campaign
for

and
if
he
had

more

Overall
a

choice
for

It

a

in

Now
it's

Losing
the
Battle
Early
in
the
movie
Gettysburg
General
John
Buford
played
by
Sam
Elliott
makes
an
impassioned
speech
about
the
failed
tactics
of
the
Federal
army
and
the
need
to
take
the
high
ground
in
the
oncoming
battle
Meade
will
come
in
slowly
cautiously
new
to
command...And
then
after
Lee's
army
is
entrenched
behind
nice
fat
rocks
Meade
will
attack
finally
if
he
can
coordinate
the
army
He'll
attack
right
up
that
rocky
slope
and
up
that
gorgeous
field
of
fire
And
we
will
charge
valiantly
and
be
butchered
valiantly
And
afterwards
men
in
tall
hats
and
gold
watch
fobs
will
thump
their
chest
and
say
what
a
brave
charge
it
was
Devin
I've
led
a
soldier's
life
and
I've
never
seen
anything
as
brutally
clear
as
this.Buford's
calvary
was
able
to
halt
the
Confederate
advance
that
day
and
the
Union
army
eventually
won
the
battle
and
the
war
Many
conservatives
are
looking
at
the
debate
over
gay
marriage
as
the
defining
issue
of
our
time
I
agree
with
them
that
the
institution
of
marriage
should
not
be
changed
by
judicial
fiat
Surveying
the
battlefield
though
it's
become
clear
that
if
conservatives
continue
using
present
tactics
we
will
lose
the
battle
and
the
war
The
major
problem
with
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
is
that
it's
too
broad
and
for
that
reason
a
number
of
rationales
have
arisen
in
support
of
it
Groups
supporting
the
FMA
cannot
seem
to
decide
what
exactly
the
FMA
will
do
The
FMA
will
protect
marriage
The
FMA
will
prevent
gay
marriage
The
FMA
will
define
marriageThe
problem
for
conservatives
especially
religious
conservatives
is
that
we
are
vulnerable
to
counter-arguments
on
at
least
two
of
these
rationales
and
have
a
weak
argument
for
the
third
The
FMA
will
protect
marriage
A
few
months
ago
pop
star
Britney
Spears
was
married
for
just
over
50
hours
When
asked
to
explain
her
quick
marriage
and
annullment
she
explained
the
whole
thing
as
being
a
joke
between
two
friends
Conservatives
said
little
about
her
pseudo-marriage
and
lost
an
opportunity
to
bolster
their
credibility
on
the
issue
of
protecting
marriage
If
marriage
is
sacred
then
conservatives
should
treat
it
as
such
regardless
of
the
sexual
orientation
of
those
involved
The
silence
of
conservatives
and
the
church
on
the
increasingly
light
treatment
of
marriage
by
society
makes
the
entire
idea
of
the
FMA
look
more
anti-gay
than
pro-marriage
The
church's
behavior
in
the
areas
of
cohabitation
and
divorce
further
erode
its
credibility
on
the
issue
of
preserving
marriage
George
Barna
has
made
a
career
out
of
surveying
the
Christian
community
and
the
general
population
about
religious
topics
His
findings
on
how
Christians
treat
divorce
and
cohabitation
are
disappointing
25
of
born
again
Christians
had
cohabitated
Born
again
Christians
are
just
as
likely
to
get
divorced
as
are
non-born
again
adults
Overall
33
of
all
born
again
individuals
who
have
been
married
have
gone
through
a
divorce
which
is
statistically
identical
to
the
34
incidence
among
non-born
again
adults.Barna
found
that
over
90
of
those
who
experienced
divorce
did
so
after
making
a
committment
to
Christ
not
before
These
numbers
show
an
appalling
lack
of
respect
for
the
institution
of
marriage
among
self-proclaimed
followers
of
Christ
and
is
a
huge
weakness
in
the
argument
that
an
amendment
to
define
marriage
as
between
a
man
and
a
woman
would
protect
the
institution
The
church's
behavior
undercuts
its
argument
and
it's
a
shame
Given
these
numbers
it
seems
the
greatest
threat
to
marriage
comes
not
from
homosexuals
but
from
heterosexuals
including
Christians
taking
marriage
lightly
or
cohabitating
without
getting
married
yet
still
enjoying
the
legal
benefits
of
such
unions
At
present
many
companies
and
states
allow
heterosexual
and
homosexual
couples
that
live
together
to
share
insurance
policies
benefit
packages
and
other
legal
incidents
of
marriage
Such
arrangements
weaken
the
institution
as
people
no
longer
see
the
necessity
of
entering
into
a
legal
marriage
In
a
sense
why
should
they
They
are
reaping
the
benefits
of
marriage
without
any
of
the
commitment
Such
arrangements
are
not
right
but
society
and
I'm
afraid
the
church
has
done
little
to
nothing
to
prevent
or
condemn
such
relationships
Instead
of
fighting
the
weakening
of
marriage
at
the
beginning
the
FMA
seems
both
a
belated
and
half-hearted
attempt
at
protecting
the
social
institution
we've
allowed
to
decline
for
so
many
years
The
FMA
will
prevent
gay
marriage
This
is
the
weakest
of
the
arguments
conservatives
can
use
against
gay
marriage
as
few
have
offered
any
substantial
argument
as
to
how
gay
marriage
will
harm
heterosexual
marriage
A
group
called
ForMarriage
offers
Scandanavia
as
an
example
According
to
Stanley
Kurtz
of
the
Hoover
Institution
before
homosexual
marriage
was
legalized
in
Scandinavia
most
couples
married
before
the
birth
of
their
second
child
together
Since
legalization
80
of
first
born
children
are
born
out
of
wedlock
and
60
of
all
subsequent
children
thereafter
are
born
to
unwed
parents
What
these
numbers
demonstrate
is
that
same
sex
marriage
further
weakens
marriage
in
all
respects
for
heterosexuals
Children
are
less
likely
to
be
raised
in
a
stable
family
environment
which
has
more
of
an
effect
on
children
than
the
happiness
of
the
parents
involved
according
to
numerous
studies
From
Scandinavia's
example
we
can
see
that
same
sex
marriage
may
not
directly
affect
your
marriage
but
has
serious
consequences
for
your
children
and
grandchildren
Your
children
will
have
a
higher
risk
of
bearing
children
out
side
of
marriage
and
your
grandchildren
will
be
more
likely
to
live
in
a
single
parent
home.Note
the
argument
It's
gay
marriage
that
will
lead
to
societal
breakdown
and
a
loss
of
respect
for
marriage
Completely
forgotten
in
this
equation
is
the
role
of
married
heterosexuals
in
protecting
the
institution
People
who
come
from
healthy
two-parent
homes
are
more
likely
to
have
stable
marriages
themselves
Gay
marriage
may
have
further
weakened
marriage
in
Scandanavia
but
judging
from
the
fact
that
most
couples
married
before
the
birth
of
their
second
child
marriage
was
already
under
considerable
strain
Once
again
it's
the
failure
of
heterosexuals
to
value
their
own
marriages
that
started
the
decline
of
the
institution
I'm
not
trying
to
be
defeatist
here
I
do
not
think
gay
marriage
is
something
society
should
pursue
I
just
think
that
before
jumping
on
the
FMA
bandwagon
conservatives
and
Christians
should
take
a
hard
realistic
look
at
what
they've
done
to
hurt
marriage
and
what
they
can
do
in
their
own
communities
and
churches
to
put
the
institution
back
on
the
road
to
good
health
Viewing
the
FMA
as
an
attempt
to
prevent
gay
marriage
is
not
an
effective
argument
It
makes
the
issue
conservatives
versus
gays
instead
of
focusing
on
the
strongest
of
the
three
arguments
I've
offered
The
FMA
defines
marriage
This
is
the
strongest
argument
we
can
use
to
prevent
gay
marriage
from
being
forced
on
society
by
an
activist
judiciary
Marriage
has
been
defined
as
it
now
exists
for
millenia
the
three
major
world
religions
Christianity
Islam
and
Judaism
all
define
marriage
as
a
sacred
covenant
between
the
sexes
What
Christians
and
conservatives
need
to
do
is
turn
the
argument
back
on
proponents
of
gay
marriage
who
are
you
to
try
and
redefine
a
social
institution
that's
thousands
of
years
old
with
a
few
court
orders
At
least
we
should
demand
legislative
action
before
the
definition
of
marriage
is
changed
What
Christians
and
conservatives
need
to
realize
is
that
this
isn't
a
moral
issue
There
is
a
moral
component
but
at
heart
this
is
a
political
fight
And
we're
losing
it
We
live
in
a
time
when
moral
and
theological
arguments
have
little
weight
in
the
public
square
and
we're
still
speaking
the
language
of
morality
and
theology
Those
languages
are
entirely
appropriate
and
have
a
useful
purpose
but
if
we
want
to
win
a
political
fight
we
have
to
start
thinking
like
politicians
That
means
looking
at
the
issue
with
a
clarity
that
is
so
far
lacking
and
discarding
the
arguments
and
approaches
that
won't
work
That
means
getting
rid
of
the
idea
of
the
FMA
and
gearing
up
for
a
long
fight
instead
of
a
quick
solution
that
won't
work
in
the
end
If
this
is
a
battle
worth
fighting
then
it's
a
battle
worth
winning
And
winning
this
one
will
take
the
patience
and
determination
of
a
General
Grant
not
the
all-or-nothing
approach
of
a
Pickett's
Charge
What
to
Do
To
start
Christians
and
conservatives
have
to
get
serious
about
fixing
marriage
That
means
ending
the
high
divorce
rate
in
churches
getting
serious
about
cohabitation
and
condemning
all
who
make
a
mockery
of
marriage
with
multiple
or
joke
marriages
It
also
means
pressuring
the
state
to
preserve
marriage
by
ending
the
practice
of
giving
marriage-like
rights
to
cohabitating
couples
Until
the
church
takes
a
stand
against
heterosexuals
who
harm
marriage
it
will
have
little
credibility
saying
the
institution
will
be
harmed
by
homosexuals
Then
we
need
to
begin
electing
people
to
public
office
who
are
serious
about
the
judiciary
The
tyranny
of
an
unelected
unrepresentative
and
unaccountable
judiciary
needs
to
be
stopped
and
we
have
the
power
to
do
it
Christians
need
to
get
involved
with
politics
even
when
so-called
moral
issues
aren't
involved
That
means
electing
people
to
the
presidency
who
will
appoint
constructionist
judges
and
electing
senators
who
will
confirm
those
nominated
No
more
making
law
from
the
bench
or
putting
the
desires
of
a
loud
minority
above
established
law
Christians
who
are
involved
in
politics
need
to
stop
seeing
laws
like
the
FMA
as
the
solution
to
societal
problems
Making
laws
to
solve
social
issues
will
only
work
as
long
as
Christians
have
the
power
to
make
those
laws
Passage
of
the
FMA
will
set
a
precedent
social
issues
can
be
resolved
through
Constitutional
amendment
It
won't
always
be
Christians
that
have
the
power
to
make
such
laws
Is
this
a
precedent
we
want
to
set
Finally
Christians
need
to
continue
the
work
they
were
put
on
earth
to
do
As
Hugh

says

book
In

important

far
less
significant

Embracing
Moore
The
Democrat
party
has
become
unhinged
Top
Democrats
including
Terry
McAuliffe
and
Tom
Harkin
attended
a
viewing
of
Michael
Moore's
documentary
Fahrenheit
9/11
While
it's
not
surprising
that
Democrats
would
embrace
this
film
it
is
disappointing
As
Christopher
Hitchens
not
a
conservative
says
in
this
evisceration
of
the
film
Moore
is
a
charlatan
who
is
making
money
from
those
whose
hatred
of
Bush
has
damaged
their
ability
to
discern
between
truth
and
falsehoods
good
and
bad
To
describe
this
film
as
dishonest
and
demagogic
would
almost
be
to
promote
those
terms
to
the
level
of
respectability
To
describe
this
film
as
a
piece
of
crap
would
be
to
run
the
risk
of
a
discourse
that
would
never
again
rise
above
the
excremental
To
describe
it
as
an
exercise
in
facile
crowd-pleasing
would
be
too
obvious
Fahrenheit
9/11
is
a
sinister
exercise
in
moral
frivolity
crudely
disguised
as
an
exercise
in
seriousness
It
is
also
a
spectacle
of
abject
political
cowardice
masking
itself
as
a
demonstration
of
dissenting
bravery.The
Democrats
are
making
a
mistake
by
associating
themselves
with
Moore
Numerous
sites
have
pointed
out
Moore's
lies
and
distortions
of
the
truth
Truth
in
fact
is
secondary
to

All
he
cares
about
is
ideology
everything
else
is
just
words
and
images
he
can
shape
to

Why

He's

problem
is

Return
of

William

the
phrase
nattering

of
negativism

describe
the

has
a
great
column
in
The
New

Times
about
the
media's
willingness
to
believe
the
negative
spin
about

A

from

Commission

Thanks
to
them
and
their
overzealousness
the
credibility

begin
losing
faith

John

should

is

Coolige
Without
the
Ethics
Fred
Barnes
on
Bill
Clinton's
legacy
I've
been
ignoring
the
hype
surrounding
the
release
of
Clinton's
memoirs
Personally
I'm
more
excited
about
this
book
The
media's
desperation
to
make
us
care
about
the
release
of
this
book
is
actually
rather
sad
They
are
trying
to
whip
up
nostalgia
but
all
I'm
managing
to
feel
is
a
kind
of
mild
contempt
mixed
with
pity
As
Barnes
says
Clinton's
presidency
was
completely
insignificant
The
economy
was
good
while
he
was
in
office
and
then
it
wasn't
He
rode
the
Dow
and
GDP
numbers
to
dizzying
heights
of
popularity
while
completely
ignoring
everything
that
mattered
The
country
was
hit
with
terrorist
attack
after
terrorist
attack
and
he
did
nothing
Now
according
to
his
memoirs
he's
attempting
once
again
to
claim
that
he
warned
Bush
about
bin
Laden
but
Bush
didn't
want
to
listen
The
guy
has
no
shame
no
class
and
no
chance
of
convincing
anyone
he
was
serious
about
terrorism
And
there's
his
legacy
in
a
nutshell
he
was
an
unserious
man
for
an
unserious
time
We
ignored
the
world
because
there
was
money
to
be
made
Clinton
had
opportunities
to
make
needed
change
and
ignored
them
because
it
would
have
been
too
hard
And
now
instead
of
quietly
fading
into
history
Bill
is
still
out
there
trying
to
rewrite
his
legacy
with
lies
I
suppose
I
should
feel
angry
but
I
just
can't
summon
the
energy
to
care
about
him
anymore
He's
not
worth
it
and
that
may
be
the
saddest
thing
of
all

Borders
Gripe
Went
to
Borders
last
night
to
skim
the
books
and
listen
to
some
live
music
My
wanderings
took
me
to
the
politics
and
current
events
section
near
the
front
where
I
was
not
at
all
surprised
to
note
that
around
90
percent
of
the
books
displayed
were
those
by
David
Corn
Michael
Moore
Bill
Press
Arianna
Huffington
and
their
ilk
No
books
were
on
display
by
Sean
Hannidy
Ann
Coulter
Laura
Ingraham
or
Stephen
Hayes
Looking
at
the
display
one
would
think
all
of
the
recent
political
books
released
of
late
were
of
the
Bush-bashing
variety
There
were
signs
everywhere
promoting
My
Life
the
Clinton
selective
memoir
coming
out
soon
On
the
second
floor
on
a
very
small
shelf
in
the
history
section
sat
some
Reagan
books
that
someone
had
obviously
just
tossed
up
there
Maybe
it's
news
to
the
idealogues
at
Borders
here
in
Bangor
but
the
purpose
of
a
bookstore
is
to
sell
books
not
arrange
the
store's
inventory
to
suit
one's
own
worldview
I
had
to
search
quite
a
while
before
finding
the
new
Neil
Cavuto
book
as
it
wasn't
anywhere
near
the
other
new
books
even
though
it's
number
13
on
the
NY
Times
Nonfiction
bestseller
list
It
was
relegated
to
a
crowded
corner
table
on
the
second
floor
of
the
bookstore
near
the
self-help
section
Wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
news
station
Mr
Cavuto
works
for
would
it
I'd
like
to
end
this
with
a
declaration
of
independence
from
Borders
a
threat
to
buy
my
books
elsewhere
but
it
would
all
be
nonsense
I
like
the
store
a
lot
and
will
continue
to
shop
there
As
a
store
in
fact
they're
probably
only
doing
what
their
own
customers
demand
through
their
purchases
of
books
by
Moore

Deal-Breaker
Andrew
Sullivan
says
he
used
the
words
deal-breaker
in
reference
to
he
and
Bush
on
February
29
After
checking
the
Daily
Dish
archives
the
only
post
on
the
29th
of
Feb
is
an
attack
on
Mel
Gibson's
Christianity
The
next
few
days
are
full
of
increasingly
shrill
and
hateful
rhetoric
about
religious
conservatives
Nice
try
That
still
doesn't
explain
his
comments
on
March
29
a
full
month
after
the
deal-breaker
DON'T
RUSH
ME
National
Review's
Kathryn
Lopez
made
the
following
remark
before
my
spring
break
I
do
wish
Sullivan
would
save
time
and
come
out
for
Kerry
now
In
just
a
matter
of
time
he
will
come
up
with
the
rationalizations
but
it's
taking
him
painfully
long
to
get
on
with
it
I'm
betting
all
Kerry
will
have
to
do
is
say
that
he's
against
terrorism
I'm
mystified
by
this
remark
It
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
a
political
writer
is
not
necessarily
partisan
Some
of
us
are
actually
trying
to
figure
out
who's
the
better
candidate
for
the
next
four
years
and
haven't
made
our
minds
up
already.[emphasis
added
This
time
in
the
last
election
cycle
I
was
for
McCain
before
I
was
for
Gore
It
took
till
the
fall
for
me
to
realize
where
Gore
was
headed
and
narrowly
opted
for
W
And
one
of
the
unique
joys
of
a
blog
like
this
is
that
a
writer
can
actually
think
out
loud
in
real
time
together
with
the
readers
Is
that
a
crime
Am
I
supposed
to
stop
thinking
at
all
Now
no
one
need
wonder
for
more
than
a
few
nano-seconds
whom
National
Review
will
endorse
this
fall
That's
fine
But
it's
equally
fine
for
others
to
take
a
more
independent
approach
There's
a
difference
between
rationalizations
and
reasons."So
was
Bush's
support
of
FMA
a
deal-breaker
or
wasn't
it
He's
claimed
since
then
that
he
meant
Bush
was
already
out
of
the
question
and
now
it
was
just
a
choice
between
Kerry
and
sitting
it
out
but
that
explanation
is
rather
weak
One
need
not
read
between
the
lines
on
this
one
to
realize
he's
talking
about
a
choice
between
the
two
major
candidates
not
between
Kerry
and
apathy
A
month
after
his
decision
not
to
back
Bush
Sullivan
is
playing
at
being
an
independent
thinker
This
is
probably
for
the
best
If
this
hadn't
turned
me
off
to
Andrew
Sullivan
his
growing
anti-religious
tone
would
have
I
know
that
some
religious
conservatives
like
those
from
Lucianne.com
yesterday
will
always
be
prejudiced
about
homosexuality
There
is
a
certain
segment
of
the
population
that
will
never
be
persuaded
to
treat
gays
and
lesbians
with
respect
The
problem
I
have
with
Sullivan's
recent
foray
into
anti-Christian
bigotry
is
his
assumption
that
all
Christians
are
the
same
He's
printed
letter
after
letter
including
one
today
that
claim
conservatism
has
been
hijacked
by
bigots
Andrew
Sullivan's
book
Virtually
Normal
helped
me
change
my
thinking
on
the
issue
of
homosexuality
I
have
spent
time
defending
Sullivan
and
his
writings
to
my
religous
conservative
friends
I
have
contributed
to
his
blog
once
or
twice
I
guess
I
feel
betrayed
not
because
I'm
disagreed
with
but
because
I
seem
to
be
unwelcome
in
Sullvan's
brand
of
conservatism
simply
because
I
take
my
religious
beliefs
seriously
and
call
myself
a
Christian
For
the
record
I
do
not
support
the
FMA
It's
a
bad
law
At
present
I
do
not
support
gay
marriage
but
I'm
willing
to
have
a
debate
about
it
Instead
those
who
support
it
want
to
push
it
through
the
courts
and
radicalize
those
who
could
have
been
persuaded
to
support
it
in
a
few
years
but
dislike
being
told
what
they
should
accept
If
having
these
beliefs
make
me
a
theocrat
or
a
bigot
fine
So
be
it
That's
your
opinion
and
I
respect
your
right
to
have
it
But
that
doesn't
mean
I
need
to
read
it
Good
bye

Allah
on
Andrew
Allahpundit
has
some
harsh
words
for
Andrew
Sullivan
on
the
comments
section
of
this
post
Here's
a
taste
We're
talking
about
a
guy
who
for
the
longest
time
beginning
with
his
very
first
post
about
the
attacks
in
fact
has
framed
the
war
as
nothing
less
than
a
fight
for
the
future
of
civilized
society
Period
And
now
not
even
three
years
later
he's
decided
he
can't
support
the
candidate
who
will
prosecute
that
war
most
effectively
because
the
same
candidate
persists
in
thinking
of
marriage
the
way
Americans
have
thought
of
it
for
225
years
That's
not
some
inconsistency
That's
a
screaming
teeth-gnashing
I-can't-f*****g-believe-I'm-reading-this
inconsistency
And
it
makes
a
mockery
of
every
piece
of
martial
rhetoric
he's
shoveled
our
way.Other
bloggers
are
expressing
similar
sentiments
This
is
it
I
think
for
Sullivan
Not
because
he
disagrees
with
conservatives
but
because
he's
been
so
duplicitous
about
it

Deal
Broken
Has
Andrew
Sullivan
been
lying
to
us
Jonah
Goldberg
has
some
quotes
from
a
piece
in
The
Advocate
by
Sullivan
who
says
Bush's
endorsement
of
antigay
discrimination
in
the
U.S
Constitution
itself
is
a
deal-breaker
I
can't
endorse
him
this
fall.As
Goldberg
says
there's
no
ethical
standard
for
blogging
but
if
this
is
how
Sullivan
really
feels
then
he's
got
some
explaining
to
do
He's
made
a
big
deal
out
of
his
struggle
with
the
issue
of
Bush
versus
Kerry
when
in
fact
his
mind
seems
to
be
made
up
Actually
now
that
I
think
of
it
why
does
Sullivan
feel
so
betrayed
During
the
2000
campaign
Bush
never
said
he
would
endorse
gay
marriage
or
even
said
anything
close
to
it
The
president
is
an
unabashed
social
conservative
and
Sullivan
knew
that
during
the
Bush
versus
Gore
contest
To
pretend
otherwise
now
is
as
ridiculous
as
Sullivan's
recent
attempts
to
turn
Ronald
Reagan
into
some
sort
of
socially
liberal
Republican
in
the
vein
of
Gov
Arnold
Schwarzenegger
I
hope
Sullivan
comes
clean
with
his
readers
soon
It
would
help
explain
his
recent
pessimism
and
trumpeting
of
anti-Bush
news
It's
just
unfortunate
that
he
has
chosen
to
subordinate
national
security
and
the
war
on
terror
an
issue
that
involves
all
Americans
in
favor
of
gay
marriage
an
issue
that
only
a
few
believe
in
and
a
minority
support
If
Sullivan
has
been
misleading
his
readers
then
his
reign
as
king
of
the
bloggers
is
officially
over
UPDATE
Sullivan
has
answered
Goldberg
on
his
site
It's
unconvincing
to
me
reading
between
the
lines
shouldn't
be
what
blogs
are
about
It
still
seems
to
me
that
he
was
trying
to
please
two
incompatible
audiences
and
has
failed

Killing
Your
Message
It
has
been
reported
that
John
Kerry's
staff
and
reporters
don't
understand
why
despite
the
bad
news
for
President
Bush
lately
they
cannot
gain
traction
with
the
American
people
Perhaps
this
will
help
explain
things
Never
in
the
2
1/4
centuries
of
our
history
has
the
United
States
been
so
isolated
among
the
nations
so
broadly
feared
and
distrusted.This
statement
is
from
the
gathering
of
has-beens
that
the
Kerry
campaign
pulled
together
to
criticize
the
president
and
his
foreign
policy
Oh
sorry
The
event
wasn't
actually
coordinated
by
the
Kerry
campaign
And
if
you
believe
that
then...well...you're
just
the
type
of
voter
Kerry
is
looking
for
The
level
of
hyperbole
used
by
liberals
when
talking
about
President
Bush
is
a
message-nullifier
Liberals
are
not
content
simply
to
disagree
with
the
president
and
his
foreign
policy
they
have
to
characterize
it
and
him
as
evil
and
make
profoundly
silly
statements
about
what
Bush
is
doing
to
America
and
the
world
Kerry
doesn't
seem
to
realize
that
most
Americans
recognize
overheated
rhetoric
when
they
hear
it
and
most
dismiss
it
as
the
ranting
of
the
angry
left
If
Kerry
keeps
aligning
himself
with
the
angriest
Bush-haters
in
his
party
then
he
will
lose
the
election
The
recent
nostalgia
over
President
Ronald
Reagan
shows
that
many
of
us
want
a
president
who
appeals
to
our
best
hopes
not
our
worst
fears
and
to
our
confidence
rather
than
our
doubts
Kerry
is
negative
Bush
is
positive

Made
the

of
watching

yesterday
morning
They

cussin

yukkin
it
up
over
how

There
was
no

in

stupid

unforgivable
things
CBS
has
so
far
run
no

involving
the
UN
Oil-for-Food
program
CBS
has
run
no
stories
about

The
Enron
story
is
old
but
partisans
and
the

refuse
to
let
it
go
Somehow
they
seem
to
consider
it
the
key
to
bringing
down
the
Bush
administration
and
winning
the
election
for
John
Kerry
Between
this
and
the
refusal

the
statistical
breakdown
of
the
recent
Los
Angeles
Times
poll
that
showed
John
Kerry
seven
points
ahead

George

The
poll
was
made
up
of
38
percent
Democrats
and
25
percent
Republicans
an
extremely
skewed
margin
Unless

there's
been

saw

I'm
still
waiting
though
for

to
clarify
the
numbers
based

this
new
information
And

credibility

another
few
points

Editors

Reporters

Sullivan
takes
another
step
toward
his
inevitable
endorsement
of

On

plan

this

Sullivan
says
John
Kerry's
position
against

marriage
but
against
the
FMA
is
not
an
electoral
loser
It's
closer
to
the
American
center
on
this
subject
than
George
W

is.Um
no
Polls
have
consistently
shown
that
the
FMA
has
considerable
support
among
the
American
people
Sullivan
was
a
much
better
blogger
when
he
engaged
in
political
punditry
that
didn't
consist
of
wishful
thinking
and
falsehoods
If
the

was
really
against
the
FMA
then
Kerry
would
be
out
there
using
it
as
a
club
with
which
to
beat

So
far
Kerry
has
remained
quiet
about

debate
in
the
hopes
that
it
will
go
away
and
not
hurt
his
chances
with

God
and
Michael
Heath
There
are
times
when
criticizing
Mike
Heath
and
the
Christian
Civic
League
of
Maine
is
almost
like
kicking
a
puppy
It's
almost
too
easy
According
to
the
League's
most
recent
Issues
Summary
the
MCCL
is
having
financial
troubles
We
are
called
to
help
define
the
common
good
If
we
don't
do
this
if
the
League
isn't
adequately
funded
then
evil
forces
will
make
our
laws
and
shape
our
culture
Dear
Christian
listener
the
League
is
perhaps
among
the
most
necessary
of
institutions
in
our
free
society.Only
the
League
is
standing
between
the
forces
of
evil
and
everything
good
and
decent
in
America
Or
at
least
Maine
God
Well
God
has
something
to
do
with
the
whole
keeping
evil
from
taking
over
I
guess...but
the
League
still
needs
money
The
league
has
served
a
valuable
purpose
it
has
shown
the
limits
of
Christian
civic
organizations
The
Christian
Civic
League
of
Maine
can
change
minds
and
influence
legislation
but
only
God
can
change
hearts
and
influence
the
direction
of
a
person's
life
Heath's
attempt
to
overstate
the
importance
of
the
League
in
order
to
raise
money
is
somewhat
sad
and
shows
the
level
to
which
he
has
been
made
irrelevant
by
the
comments
he
made
a
few
months
ago
If
Heath
really
wants
to
strengthen
Christian
influence
in
Augusta
he'll
resign
and
allow
someone
without
his
political
baggage
to
take
the
League's
reigns

Big

Andrew
Sullivan's
tirade
against
religious
conservatives
continues
on

He
quotes
a
story
about
some
admittedly
crazy
religious
conservatives
who
want
to
secede
from
the
United

and
form
a
theocracy
of
sorts

point
it

Sullivan
implies
that
Karl
Rove

the
theocrats
egad
I'm
tired
of

term

Sullivan
has
made
quite
a
bit
of
noise
about
the
need
for
the
Republican
party
to
include
gay
and
lesbian
members
and
increase
its
diversity
He's
used
the
death
of
Ronald

as
a
hook
upon
which
to
hang
such
an
argument
and
has
made
a
fatuous
comparison
between

Governor
Arnold
Schwarzenegger
I
don't
disagree
with
the
idea
that

should
appeal
to

groups
What
bothers
me
are
Sullivan's
venomous
arguments
and

digs
against

who
have

Perhaps
he
should

All
Gay
All
the
Time
Michael
Heath
is
obsessed
with
homosexuality
That's
the
only
conclusion
I
can
draw
from
his
latest
issues
summary
at
the
Christian
Civic
League
of
Maine
website
click
Issues
Summary
Four
out
of
five
of
the
issues
summarized
are
about
homosexuality
gay
marriage
and
related
topics
The
reputation
of
the
CCLM
has
already
been
harmed
this
year
by
Heath's
foolish
venture
into
the
politics
of
outing
The
fact
that
Heath
is
focusing
on
homosexuality
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
issues
should
give
Christians
pause
Yes
gay
marriage
is
an
important
topic
and
one
that
should
be
discussed
Heath
is
treating
homosexuality
and
marriage
though
as
the
most
important
topic
facing
Christians
in
Maine
today
If
Heath
wants
to
make
a
difference
for
Christian
families
he
could
advocate
school
choice
initiatives
Countless
Christian
families
cannot
afford
to
pay
both
property
taxes
and
Christian
school
tuition
Vouchers
would
allow
these
families
to
send
their
kids
to
a
school
that
reflects
Christian
values
Heath
is
content
to
simply
complain
about
the
curriculum
instead
of
promoting
a
system
that
would
bring
accountability
and
competition
to
the
public
school
system
If
Heath
wants
to
take
a
stand
for
Christian
values
he
could
use
the
League
to
advocate
for
more
crisis
pregnancy
centers
in
Maine
or
help
those
centers
that
do
exist
to
raise
funds
to
get
ultrasound
technology
into
their
offices
This
would
give
young
women
considering
abortion
the
chance
to
actually
see
their
baby
which
could
help
lower
the
state's
abortion
rate
Personally
I
think
Heath
is
someone
who
doesn't
realize
his
time
is
up
When
the
CCLM
board
didn't
fire
Heath
after
his
misguided
plan
to
out
legislators
they
harmed
the
organization's
reputation
and
efficacy
His
latest
issues
summary
does
nothing
to
help
his
tattered
reputation
If
the
Christian
Civic
League
wants
to
be
successful
it
should
focus
on
a
variety
of
issues
that
are
important
to
people
of
faith
not
just
one
issue
that
will
scare
them
into
supporting
the
league

the
role
of
Congress
and
the
courts
or
what
Jefferson
described
as
a
decent
respect
for
the
opinion
of
mankind.'Wow
And
this
is
only
the
third
paragraph
of
Gore's
speech
The
prisoners
have
as
a
whole
been
treated
humanely
No
U.S
soldier
has
yet
been
accused
of
torturing
or
killing
an
Iraqi
soldier
The
abuses
at
Abu
Gharib
were
sickening
but
isolated
International
treaties
Does
Gore
honestly
think
the
Arab
world
hates
us
because
we
didn't
ratify
Kyoto
Would
a
treaty
have
prevented
September
11
After
Hitler
invaded
France
Neville
Chamberlain
realized
his
mistake
A
treaty
didn't
prevent
World
War
II
and
one
will
not
prevent
against
terrorist
attacks
After
all
it's
a
piece
of
paper
that
represents
trust
between
nations
acting
in
good
faith
The
enemy
we're
fighting
has
already
shown
a
willingness
to
abuse
our
good
will
and
hospitality
and
a
disregard
for
normal
rules
of
war
Would
some
signatures
on
a
piece
of
paper
change
an
entire
culture
Opinions
of
our
allies
As
always
read
allies
as
France
and
Germany
Gore
would
have
been
willing
to
subordinate
our
national
security
to
the
whim
of
foreign
elites
Thank
God
this
man
didn't
become
president
Role
of
Congress
and
the
courts
Congress
voted
overwhelmingly
for
war
The
courts
are
a
necessary
part
of
the
Patriot
Act
Or
has
Gore
like
so
many
just
not
read
it
A
decent
respect
for
the
opinion
of
mankind
Meaning
Al
Gore
and
MoveOn.org
He
did
not
honor
the
advice
experience
and
judgment
of
our
military
leaders
in
designing
his
invasion
of
Iraq
And
now
he
will
not
honor
our
fallen
dead
by
attending
any
funerals
or
even
by
permitting
photos
of
their
flag-draped
coffins.Screw
you
Al
What
a
sickening
line
this
is
Gore
and
his
minions
have
no
problem
using
the
military
dead
as
a
club
with
which
to
beat
the
president
The
rule
on
coffins
was
instituted
during
the
Clinton
administration
and
Gore
knows
it
That
makes
his
words
all
the
more
outrageous
His
use
of
this
particular
rhetorical
point
shows
he's
not
interested
in
actual
political
debate
he
just
wants
to
score
points
Pardon
the
strong
language
but
what
a
miserable
bastard
The
long
successful
strategy
of
containment
was
abandoned
in
favor
of
the
new
strategy
of
preemption.'Yeah
containment
worked
so
well
in
the
past
Check
an
encyclopedia
Look
under
Chamberlain
Neville
Also
containment
doesn't
prevent
a
ruler
from
funding
terrorist
attacks
which
Hussein
did
bribing
world
leaders
which
Hussein
did
developing
nasty
weapons
like
sarin
gas
or
murdering
his
own
people
again
Hussein
did
The
new
isolationism
is
on
the
left
it
seems
A
policy
based
on
domination
of
the
rest
of
the
world
not
only
creates
enemies
for
the
United
States
and
creates
recruits
for
Al
Qaeda
it
also
undermines
the
international
cooperation
that
is
essential
to
defeating
the
efforts
of
terrorists
who
wish
harm
and
intimidate
Americans.Here
we
go
again
International
cooperation
France
Germany
When
has
France
ever
cooperated
with
the
United
States
against
terrorists
Or
does
Gore
not
remember
April
1986
and
the
bombing
of
Libya
Who
didn't
let
us
use
their
airspace
The
lack
of
international
cooperation
didn't
begin
with
the
Bush
administration
and
it
won't
end
with
the
Bush
administration
If
you
want
to
see
domination
by
the
way
look
at
France's
treatment
of
its
African
colonies
Did
they
get
UN
permission
to
send
troops
into
the
Ivory
Coast
In
December
of
2000
even
though
I
strongly
disagreed
with
the
decision
by
the
U.S
Supreme
Court
to
order
a
halt
to
the
counting
of
legally
cast
ballots
I
saw
it
as
my
duty
to
reaffirm
my
own
strong
belief
that
we
are
a
nation
of
laws
and
not
only
accept
the
decision
but
do
what
I
could
to
prevent
efforts
to
delegitimize
George
Bush
as
he
took
the
oath
of
office
as
president
I
did
not
at
that
moment
imagine
that
Bush
would
in
the
presidency
that
ensued
demonstrate
utter
contempt
for
the
rule
of
law
and
work
at
every
turn
to
frustrate
accountability.Bitter
much
Let's
all
remember
that
Gore
only
accepted
the
decision
when
it
was
apparent
that
he
had
lost
Since
then
his
bringing
up
of
Florida
at
every
opportunity
does
plenty
to
delegitimize
the
presidency
of
George
Bush
Gore
has
completed
his
transformation
from
statesman
to
Ted
Rall
cartoon
If
Gore
were
a
more
sympathetic
figure
it
would
be
sad
to
watch
After
what
Gore
said
yesterday
and
his
attitude
saying
it
I'm
not
exactly
feeling
sympathetic
toward
the
former
vice
president
What

along

News
that
John

is
making
Bostonians
angry
It's
one

to
have
the

closed
just

a

harder
to
take."I
think
this
is
one
of
the

stupid

Kerry

he's
making
it
for
reasons
that
are
self-centered
I
can't

hear

gave
them

pep
talk
telling
them
how
good
the
economy
is

how
determined
he
is
to
prevail
in
Iraq
Then
he
didn't
take
any
questions
and
left
The
members
expecting
a
more
substantive
session
were
disappointed.The
members
were
expecting
more
of
the
president
Oh
the
poor
dears
I'm
sure
he's
felt
the
same
way
for
months
Congressional
Republicans
have
been
a
huge
disappointment
since
the
2000
election
Hardly
any
of
them
spend
time
defending
the
president
against

attacks
They
have
been
meek
as
mice

money

didn't

in

the
point
of
having
a
Republican
Congress
if

hinder

and
then
cry
like

with
greater
respect

you
know
for
those
times
that
Clinton
authorized
the
bombings
of
Kosovo
and
Iraq
And
the
sending
of
troops
into
Haiti
Other
than
those
though
every
president
has
worked
through
international
structures
Of
course
Kerry
is
ignoring
Bush's
year-long
appeal
to
the
United
Nations
and
that
organization's
refusal
to
enforce
its
own
resolutions
This
has
been
a
terrible
period
of
loss
of
American
influence
respect
and
prestige
and
it
costs
us
all
across
the
globe.What's
more
important
Being
liked
by
everybody
or
preventing
future
terrorist
attacks
against
this
country
I
guess
we
know
what
Kerry's
answer
to
this
question
would
be
Personally
I
don't
think
most
Americans
are
all
that
concerned
with
what
some
elites
in
Europe
think
of
us
as
long
as
we're
doing
the
right
thing
Preventing
terror
attacks
and
freeing
people
from
the
rule
of
a
dictator
qualify
Notice
that
Kerry
doesn't
explain
exactly
how
the
alleged
loss
of
prestige
influence
respect
has
cost
us
Other
than
some
snooty
comments
by
foreign
leaders
I
don't
see
a
real
cost
here
Plus
Kerry
is
making
the
assumption
that
Chiraq
and
Schroeder
will
always
be
who
we
deal
with
on
the
international
stage
judging
by
the
popularity
or
lack
of
it
of
these
two
leaders
that's
not
a
bet
I'd
be
willing
to
make
Despite
the
whining
of
some
European
elites
America
is
still
the
most
powerful
country
on
the
globe
politically
economically
and
militarily
Our
prestige
comes
because
of
what
we've
achieved
and
is
not
dependent
on
what
others
think
of
us
Look
you
may
have
some
deployments
of
people
for
a
long
period
of
time
in
the
Middle
East
depending
on
what
the
overall
approach
to
the
Middle
East
is
I'm
not
going
to
tell
you
we
won't
shift
deployments
from
one
place
to
another
but
we're
not
going
to
be
engaged
in
an
active
kind
of
death
zone
the
way
we
are
today.Okay
I
have
no
idea
what
this
means
I
think
it
means
he
will
pull
troops
out
of
battle
zones
but
still
manage
to
win
the
war
But
if
we
pull
troops
out
of
where
the
enemy
is
then
how
are
we
going
to
win
the
war
What's
a
death
zone
anyway
This
is
a
blatant
attempt
by
John
Kerry
to
pull
votes
away
from
Ralph
Nader
He's
trying
to
play
both
sides
of
the
Iraq
issue
by
saying
he'll
pull
the
troops
out
of
Iraq
but
at
the
same
time
ensure
that
troops
stay
in
Iraq
I
think
Either
way
he's
playing
politics
with
national
security
and
his
comments
will
doubtless
galvanize
the
Iraqi

Law

Hugh
Hewitt
points
to
a
story
today
in
the
Washington
Post
A
number
of
Catholic
Democrats
have
written
a
letter
to
Cardinal
Theodore
E
McCarrick
to
protest
the
stance
of
bishops
who
have
threatened
to
withhold
communion
from
pro-abortion
lawmakers
and
their
supporters
They
claim
such
a
move
would
return
the
U.S
to
a
time
of
anti-Catholic
bigotry
a
ridiculous
assertion
Who
exactly
will
start
to
feel
prejudice
against
Catholics
if
someone
like
John
Kerry
is
denied
communion
The
only
people
likely
to
feel
put
out
are
Kerry's
fellow
Democrats
Are
these
lawmakers
afraid
that
people
in
their
own
party
will
rise
up
in
a
wave
of
hatred
against
Catholics
If
not
what
are
they
saying
An
excerpt
from
the
article
Noting
that
the
Supreme
Court
has
ruled
that
women
have
a
constitutional
right
to
choose
an
abortion
they
said
that
members
of
Congress
who
vote
for
legislation
consistent
with
that
mandate
are
not
acting
contrary
to
our
positions
as
faithful
members
of
the
Catholic
Church..."In
other
words
these
lawmakers
in
direct
violation
of
Acts
5:29
have
put
the
laws
of
man
above
those
of
God
I
wonder
why
these
legislators
even
bother
with
Catholicism
They
seem
to
have
decided
the
issue
of
supremacy
in
their
lives
and
God
has
lost
We
also
do
not
believe
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
legislators
to
prohibit
all
conduct
which
we
may
as
a
matter
of
personal
morality
believe
is
wrong."The
problem
is
that
most
of
them
go
far
beyond
simply
not
prohibiting
abortion
They
actively
support
it
fund
it
make
it
easier
for
people
to
have
abortions
Their
deeds
do
not
show
any
indication
that
they
consider
abortion
wrong
These
are
people
who
expect
the
church
to
change
its
rules
to
suit
their
morality
In
making
such
a
demand
of
the
church
they
are
showing
exactly
who
is
at
the
center
of
their
lives
They
believe
religion
exists
to
edify
them
not
glorify
God
In
fact
the
simple
act
of
protest
against
the
church's
enforcement
of
rules
shows
how
self-centered
these
legislators
really
are
The
church
is
operating
on
a
tough
love
strategy
of
sorts
here
They
aren't
trying
to
make
a
political
statement
they
are
trying
to
warn
these
legislators
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
Catholic
church
and
God
support
of
abortion
rights
threatens
their
salvation
The
bishops
probably
don't
care
about
politics
they're
just
tired
of
seeing
legislators
flaunt
God's
law
and
take
communion
anyway
in
violation
of
scripture
Were
I
these
legislators
I
would
be
less
concerned
about
what
the
church
is
saying
and
more
concerned
with
what
God
might
say
when
the
time
comes

Hollywood's
Favorite
Egomaniac
Michael
Moore
says
he
intends
to
distribute
his
film
Fahrenheit
911
on
Independence
Day
here
in
the
United
States
and
release
the
DVD
in
October
His
reason
for
such
a
short
turnaround
is
that
he
hopes
to
influence
the
election
The
real
reason
of
course
is
that
the
audience
is
limited
for
Moore's
particular
brand
of
documentary
The
film
probably
won't
make

made
in

about

film
and
its

I'm

The
film
according
to
what
I've
heard
uses
pictures
of
September
11
and
Iraqi
and
American
war
dead
and
injured
Where
is
the

from

Families
for

Peaceful
Tomorrow
or
MoveOn.org
I
would
hate
to
think
their
outrage
was

and
not

heart
Let's
face
it
Moore
is
a
liar
And
a

American

themselves
especially
willing

Do

Do

will
lead

the
destruction

as

the
eventual

Not

Conservative
groups
have
spent
months
trying
to
convince
people
that
gay
marriage
will
irrevocably
harm
the
moral
fabric
of
our
society
Who

It
may
in

But
for
the
next
few
years
it
will
probably
do
little
to
weaken
marriage
as
we
know
it
When
the
horrible
effects
that
conservatives
predicted
just
don't
materialize
what
will
the
public
think
When
people
were
last
polled
about
the
environment
around
earth
day
only
about
30
percent
considered
it
a
top
priority
This
is
down
from
a
few
years
ago
when
earth
day
was
able
to
pull
large
crowds
at
rallies
and
claim
public
attention
This
decline
in
passion
for
the
environment
came
about
not
because
the
environment
is
no
longer
a
problem
but
because
the
public
noticed
a
disconnect
between
the
rhetoric
of
the
environmentalists
and
reality
My
fear
is
that
many
will
see
a
similar
disconnect
between
the
sometimes
hysterical
rhetoric
of
the
right
on
gay
marriage
and
the
reality
of
what
a
society
with
legal
gay
marriage
looks
like
This
isn't
to
say
we
shouldn't
fight
for
what
we
believe
in

Just

no
idea
what
we're
up
against

don't
really

I'm
exaggerating
Look
at
some

posts
from

I
ain't
buyin
it...sorry
I
can't
escape
the
sense
that
this
kilig
was
staged
for
an
American
audience
and
not
exclusively
by
the
terrorists
What
a
perfect
way
to
deflect
attention
from
the
autrocities
we
committed
over
there
by
giveing
this
mound
of
red
meat

the
true

hating

get

Mighty
convenient.Hmmmmmm
This
is
just
more
bullshit
from
the
WH.Or
more
from
another
thread
I
think
that
all
of
the
atrocities
we
are
experiencing
are
a
result
of
an
unjust
war
If
you
invade
a
country
based
on
lies
these
sort
of
things
will
happen
if
you
don't
like
what
is
happening
it
is
not
the
fault
of
the
media
The
blame
lies
squarely
on
the
shoulders
of
our
murderous
government
We
will
not
win
this
war
and
the
world
will
not
be
safer
because
of
this
war
These
kinds
of
events
are
bearing
this
out
We
tried
to
warn
them
but
they
would
not
listen
the
Bushies
and
the
jihadists
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
they
need
each
other
to
survive
Let's
see
if
we
can
take
as
well
as
we
dish
it
out
Oh
yeah
now
that
Abu
Graib
prison
photos
are
coming
out
the
damn
Nazis
bring
out
a
video
of
an
american
being
killed
If
this
doesn't
say
Propaganda
then
I
don't
know
what
is
What
makes
me
wanna
puke
is
the
likelihood
that
our
own
government
did
this
act
in
order
to
generate
counter-propaganda
It
is
blood
on
Bush
Co
handsThere
are
many
many
more
comments
and
threads
along
the
same
line
but
I
think
you
get
the
point
and
I
was
tired
of
wallowing
in
that
sewer
of
a
site
An
American
is
brutally
murdered
and
the
first
instinct
among
those
on
the
left
is
to
blame
the
Bush
administration
and
the
CIA
If
John
Kerry
really
wants
to
get
serious
about
the
war
he
could
start
by
confronting
the
haters
who
make
up
part
of
his
support

Hollywood's

When

Cal
Thomas

the

in

to
what

is
pretty
steep
MGM

a

it

who
went

Good
luck
guys
Christians
went
to
see
The
Passion
because
it
respected
both
our
faith
and
the
One
who
is
at
the
center
of
that
faith
For
once
believers
in
a
Hollywood
movie
were
not
portrayed
as
crazy
evil
or
stupid
Jesus
was
used
as
a
name
not
just
an
expletive
The
movie
was
violent
and
sad
but
at
the

time
full
of
hope
and
promise
I
doubt
Hollywood
can
make
a
good
movie
with
Christian
themes
because
they
do
not
understand
Christianity
Unfortunately
until
they
learn
or
grow
bored
trying
we'll
probably
have

endure

Modern
Manners
Last
night
I
went
to
see
Van
Helsing
with
some
friends
The
movie
was
pretty
bad
it
was
about
an
hour
too
long
and
it
seemed
as
though
every
time
Stephen
Sommers
wrote
himself
into
a
corner
he
introduced
a
new
monster
Hugh
Jackman
was
good
though
and
it
was
fun
in
parts
The
major
problem
was
that
we
were
in
the
same
theater
with
us
was
a
group
of
younger
viewers
One
of
them
had
a
cell
phone
which
she
let
ring
at
least
twice
during
the
movie
To
make
matters
worse
she
answered
one
call
and
talked
for
a
good
half-hour
at
one
point
Those
of
us
in
the
theater
hollered
at
her
a
bit
but
to
no
avail
I'm
no
expert
on
manners
and
etiquette
but
this
one
should
be
a
no-brainer
This
person
paid
4.50
to
talk
on
a
cell
phone
throughout
a
movie
interrupting
others
who
had
paid
to
actually
imagine
watch
the
movie
Many
columnists
have
spent
time
trying
to
analyze
the
reasons
behind
the
modern
lack
of
manners
Some
chalk
it
up
to
the
speed
at
which
our
society
moves
others
to
how
impersonal
we
have
become
I
have
a
different
more
simple
explanation
Some
people
are
just
jerks
Nothing
profound
I
know
Society
once
shunned
jerk
behavior
but
no
longer
Perhaps
it's
time
to
return
the
idea
of
shame
when
dealing
with
jerks
Kicking
them
out
of
public
places
when
they
act
like
jerks
would
be
a
start
Sure
the
multiplex
would
have
lost
a
couple
of
bucks
and
some
return
business
but
would
have
gained
the
gratitude
of
everyone
else
in
that
theater

OSC
on
Wartime
Elections
Orson
Scott
Card
writing
in
the
Ornery
American
has
some
interesting
things
to
say
about
elections
during
a
war
and
slippery
slopes
A
preview
And
if
John
Kerry
were
actually
concerned
about
our
troops
and
about
the
war
on
terror
he
would
make
the
unequivocal
statement
in
every
speech
that
no
matter
who
wins
the
election
America
will
fight
the
war
on
terror
including
the
campaign
in
Iraq
to
the
end
We'll
only
go
home
when
the
terrorism
stops
he
should
say
Then
instead
of
gaining
encouragement
and
recruits
from
America's
political
process
the
terrorists
might
begin
to
see
the
handwriting
on
the
wall
Of
course
Kerry
should
only
say
that
if
it's
true
Because
in
all
likelihood
if
he's
elected
he
would
almost
certainly
adopt
policies
that
would
effectively
end
the
war
on
terror
well
short
of
victory.Keep
that
in
mind
next
time
you
read
Andrew
Sullivan
or
another
wavering
conservative
try
and
defend
the
re-branding
theory
on
the
grounds
that
Kerry
would
continue
the
war
What
has
Kerry
done
or
said
that
leads
one
to
this
conclusion
Kerry
is
a
member
of
a
party
that
has
given
and
continues
to
give
the
terrorists
plenty
of
encouragement
Everytime
Kerry
Biden
Kennedy
or
Byrd
open
their
mouths
the
terrorists
see
cracks
in
our
resolve
that
they
will
exploit
with
more
violence
more
terror
more
death
Words
have
consequences
a
fact
forgotten
by
those
who
serve
in
Congress
where
bloviating
gets
you
airtime
on
C-SPAN
and
maybe
a
mention
in
the
New
York
Times
The
Democrat
party
has
been
hurt
badly
by
its
Anybody
But
Bush
mentality
They
have
subordinated
everything
to
politics
and
their
desire
to
beat
Bush
in
the
election
No
principles
no
vision
Just
venom
and
ambition
That's
why
I
don't
think
they'll
win
the
election
Kennedy's
speech
in
the
link
above
was
an
overstepping
of
the
bounds
on
this
one
Comparing
U.S
troops
to
Saddam's
regime
will
not
sit
well

Huh
Maybe
someday
I'll
get
tired
of
my
new
hobby
of
criticizing
Andrew
Sullivan
But
not
today
I
actually
read
today's
post
last
night
and
it
didn't
make
any
sense
then
I
chalked
it
up
to
being
tired
and
re-read
it
this
morning
Nope
Still
can't
figure
out
just
what
the
hell
he
believes
anymore
Consider
if
I
knew
before
the
war
what
I
know
now
would
I
still
have
supported
it
I
cannot
deny
that
the
terrible
mismanagement
of
the
post-war
something
that
no
reasonable
person
can
now
ignore
has
perhaps
fatally
wrecked
the
mission.An
annoying
feature
has
crept
into
Sullivan's
writing
of
late
the
subtle
ad
hominem
Sullivan
makes
points
then
adds
a
sentence
to
assure
that
any
criticism
of
his
point
is
already
defined
Note
he
says
the
war
is
mismanaged
and
that
no
reasonable
person
can
ignore
it
Thus
he's
made
his
point
and
at
the
same
time
defined
any
possible
response
as
unreasonable
Nice
Let
us
continue
But
does
it
make
the
case
for
war
in
retrospect
invalid
My
tentative
answer
and
this
is
a
blog
written
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
not
a
carefully
collected
summary
of
my
views
is
yes
I
still
would
have
supported
the
war
But
only
just
And
whether
the
just
turns
into
a
no
depends
on
how
we
deal
with
the
huge
challenge
now
in
front
of
us.So
in
retrospect
I'm
just
going
to
cover
all
my
bases
by
basing
my
support
on
how
Bush
responds
to
the
latest
crisis
regardless
of
any
impassioned
argument
I
may
have
made
in
the
past
about
why
the
war
is
important
So
basically
with
a
few
words
Sullivan
has
admitted
that
principle
has
little
to
do
with
his
stance
it's
all
about
the
results
I
do
like
that
he
admits
this
isn't
a
carefully
collected
summary
It
provides
cover
for
the
truly
atrocious
mess
this
post
becomes
The
narrative
of
liberation
was
critical
to
the
success
of
the
mission
politically
and
militarily
This
was
never
going
to
be
easy
but
it
was
worth
trying
It
was
vital
to
reverse
the
Islamist
narrative
that
pitted
American
values
against
Muslim
dignity
The
reason
Abu
Ghraib
is
such
a
catastrophe
is
that
it
has
destroyed
this
narrative
It
has
turned
the
image
of
this
war
into
the
war
that
the
America-hating
left
always
said
it
was
a
brutal
imperialist
racist
occupation
designed
to
humiliate
another
culture
Abu
Ghraib
is
Noam
Chomsky's
narrative
turned
into
images
more
stunning
more
damaging
more
powerful
than
a
million
polemics
from
Ted
Rall
or
Susan
Sontag
It
is
Osama's
dream
propaganda
coup
It
is
Chirac's
fantasy
of
vindication
It
is
Tony
Blair's
nightmare
And
whether
they
are
directly
responsible
or
not
the
people
who
ran
this
war
are
answerable
to
America
to
America's
allies
to
Iraq
for
the
astonishing
setback
we
have
now
encountered
on
their
watch
What
The
Hell
So
a
few
Americans
abuse
some
prisoners
and
this
somehow
invalidates
the
liberation
of
millions
Sullivan
makes
no
attempt
to
put
this
into
context
The
Muslim
world
has
done
much
worse
and
the
left
has
said
and
done
nothing
But
rather
than
point
this
out
Sullivan
would
rather
condone
the
overheated
and
hateful
criticism
and
says
that
the
mistreatment
of
prisoners
legitimizes
everything
the
left
has
said
about
this
war
Sullivan
meet
deep
end
Deep
end
Sullivan
The
one
anti-war
argument
that
in
retrospect
I
did
not
take
seriously
enough
was
a
simple
one
It
was
that
this
war
was
noble
and
defensible
but
that
this
administration
was
simply
too
incompetent
and
arrogant
to
carry
it
out
effectively.Uh
when
was
that
criticism
made
exactly
The
left
has
said
many
things
about
this
war
but
I've
never
heard
them
say
it
was
noble
and
defensible
Sullivan
I
think
is
refusing
to
take
ownership
of
his
own
opinions
by
casting
them
onto
a
faceless
nameless
other
The
left
has
called
this
war
unjust
racist
the
cowboy
actions
of
an
out-of-control
president
They
have
never
made
the
case
for
war
Sullivan
who
has
already
indicated
support
for
the
rebranding
argument
Bush
is
damaged
goods
the
war
should
go
on
under
a
different
president
is
simply
trying
to
prepare
people
for
a
long
anguished
polemic
on
why
he
supports
John
Kerry
By
the
way
I'm
skipping
around
his
post
quite
a
bit
It's
long
and
so
convoluted
that
I
don't
feel
like
fisking
the
whole
thing
So
go
read
it
yourself
if
you
want
to
see
the
whole
thing
By
refusing
to
hold
anyone
accountable
the
president
has
also
shown
he
is
not
really
in
control.In
other
words
fire
Rumsfeld
who
Sullivan
has
always
disliked
Why
not
just
come
out
and
say
it
He
then
goes
on
for
a
few
sentences
about
how
we
need
to
win
the
war
By
this
point
though
his
words
ring
hollow
He's
spent
too
much
time
justifying
the
criticism
of
the
left
for
the
words
to
sound
real
coming
from
his
blog
anymore
Now
the
big
ending
And
then
when
November
comes
around
we
have
to
decide
whether
this
president
is
now
a
liability
in
the
war
on
terror
or
the
asset
he
once
was
How
he
reacts
to
this
crisis
whether
he
is
even
in
touch
enough
to
recognize
it
as
a
crisis
should
determine
how
the
country
votes
this
fall
He
and
his
team
have
failed
us
profoundly
He
has
a
few
months
to
show
he
can
yet
succeed.Bush
failed
The
Bush
administration
has
toppled
two
totalitarian
regimes
prevented
any
terrorist
attacks
from
happening
since
September
11
and
has
kept
the
economy
from
falling
into
a
deep
recession
after
the
attacks
with
a
pretty
good
tax
cut
plan
But
in
Sullivan's
world
some
attacks
on
American
troops
during
wartime
and
the
stripping
naked
of
a
few
Arab
men
invalidates
all
of
this
I
really
wish
Sullivan
would
be
honest
with
his
readers
and
admit
that
nothing
the
president
does
between
now
and
November
would
garner
Sullivan's
support
What
made
Sullivan's
blog
so
good
in
the
past
is
that
he
was
willing
to
speak
truth
even
if
it
was
unpopular
Coming
out
for
John
Kerry
now
would
not
win
Sullivan
any
kudos
from
the
right

it
would
be
more
honest
than
the
posturing
he's
doing
now

Bush's
Numbers
Both
Election
Projection
and
John
Zogby
say
that
if
the
election
were
held
today
Kerry
would
likely
win
I
think
they're
both
right
The
prisoner
abuse
story
has
hurt
the
president
just
as
he
was
coming
off
a
pretty
good
week
However
do
I
think
Bush
is
going
to
lose
in
November
Probably
not
Kerry's
major
weakness
as
a
candidate
is
that
nothing
positive
has
changed
his
numbers
In
other
words
the
Bush
numbers
only
go
down
after
Bush
has
had
a
bad
week
not
when
Kerry
has
had
a
good
one
Kerry
has
not
yet
given
the
American
voter
a
compelling
reason
to
vote
for
him
only
against
George
W
Bush
His
biography
ads
are
not
giving
him
a
big
jump
in
the
numbers
the
change
only
seems
to
be
a
reflection
of
how
the
recent
news
is
hurting
the
president
If
Bush
does
lose
this
will
be
one
of
the
first
elections
in
which
the
press
blatantly
played
advocate
for
one
candidate
over
another
They
have
routinely
ignored
stories
that
are
harmful
to
Kerry
while
playing
up
those
that
hurt
the
president
The
prisoner
abuse
story
is
terrible
but
it
hardly
warrants
the
around-the-clock
coverage
it's
been
getting
Why
didn't
the
media
show
pictures
of
dead
Americans
killed
and
mutilated
by
Iraqis
Why
did
they
stop
showing
pictures
of
the
planes
slamming
into
the
Twin
Towers
and
of
the
people
who
jumped
to
their
deaths
Why
aren't
they
showing
the
true
brutality
of
the
enemy
The
worst
story
by
a
media
figure
so
far
is
by
Karen
Tumulty
in
Time
magazine
It's
entitled
What
Kerry
Means
to
Say
and
tries
to
explain
away
the
candidate's
misstatements
and
campaign
problems
It's
a
pretty
partisan
piece
of
work
just
like
Newsweek's
LoseWeek
edition
It's
gotten
to
the
point
where
I
just
don't
trust
the
media
and
I'm
sure
many
other
Americans
feel
the
same
way
No
matter
who
wins
the
election
in
November
they
will
have
a
lot
of
explaining
to
do

The
Limits
of
Compassion
This
evening
I
was
supposed
to
be
at
the
Maine
Christian
Teen
Convention
MCTC
helping
people
sign
up
to
sponsor
a
child
with
World
Vision
International
a
Christian
relief
organization
When
I
arrived
at
the
event
I
saw
no
World
Vision
table
Instead
I
saw
a
large
Compassion
International
banner
Thinking
the
World
Vision
table
must
be
elsewhere
I
walked
around
the
auditorium
for
a
bit
Nothing
Curious
I
approached
the
Compassion
table
introduced
myself
to
the
two
women
standing
there
and
asked
them
where
I
might
find
the
World
Vision
table
They
won't
be
setting
up
tonight
one
of
them
replied
Confusion
Really
Why
not
Compassion
is
with
this
event
she
said
This
event
being
the
Maine
Christian
Teen
Convention
Yes
We've
been
with
the
event
for
years
so
they
won't
be
setting
up
tonight
The
woman
was
polite
enough
but
her
demeanor
didn't
invite
further
questions
I
didn't
trust
my
sometimes
out-of-control
mouth
to
respond
in
a
civil
manner
so
I
left
the
event
in
disgust
According
to
the
organization's
website
last
year
World
Vision
helped
100
million
people
in
99
countries
My
wife
and
I
sponsor
a
child
in
India
with
World
Vision
As
I've
stated
before
on
this
blog
the
organization
has
recently
started
a
project
to
combat
the
growing
problem
of
AIDS
in
Africa
The
featured
performer
that
evening
was
with
World
Vision
None
of
this
seemed
to
matter
either
to
the
people
at
Compassion
International
or
the
organizers
of
the
MCTC
The
needs
of
the
event
took
precedence
over
the
fact
that
lives
would
be
affected
by
the
decision
On
a
truck
somewhere
behind
the
Bangor
Civic
Center
are
some
boxes
In
those
boxes
are
the
names
and
biographies
of
hundreds
of
children
that
will
never
have
a
chance
to
have
their
stories
told
at
the
MCTC
All
of
them
live
in
Third
World
or
developing
countries
most
of
them
live
in
poverty
or
close
enough
to
it
to
need
the
services
that
Christian
relief
organizations
provide
None
of
them
will
be
sponsored
by
people
in
Bangor
because
of
the
stubbornness
of
Compassion
International
and
the
refusal
of
those
at
the
MCTC
to
stand
up
and
say
it's
wrong
for
one
relief
organization
to
keep
another
out
of
an
event
There
is
no
good
reason
why
both
organizations
could
not
be
under
the
same
roof
just
earthly
turf
wars
hurting
God's
Kingdom
Compassion
International
may
have
had
the
right
to
do
what
they
did
they
likely
sponsor
the
event
in
some
way
But
this
isn't
Coke
versus
Pepsi
There
is
more
at
stake
here
than
sugared
water
These
are
the
lives
of
children
and
families
who
are
helped
by
World
Vision
every
day
Sure
Compassion
will
sign
up
a
few
more
kids
add
a
few
dollars
to
the
non-profit
organization's
bottom
line
Hurray
for
them
But
at
what
cost
Ultimately
the
actions
taken
tonight
will
have
repercussions
far
beyond
what
we
can
see
right
now
and
I
hope
that
someday
someone
is
called
to
account
in
heaven
for
what
happened
in
a
small
auditorium
in
Maine
I'm
angry
and
hope
that
reading
this
you
get
angry
too
What
are
we
here
on
earth
to
do
Make
sure
our
organization
achieves
primacy
over
another
Ensure
that
we've
met
our
sponsored
kid
quota
Are
we
here
on
earth
to
keep
our
organizations
financially
solvent
Obviously
no
Who
knows
how
many
times
this
has
happened
It's
time
for
the
church
to
get
angry
and
demand
organizations
that
operate
in
the
name
of
Jesus
remember
why
they
exist
and
who
they
are
here
to
help
instead
of
playing
games
of
one-upsmanship
When
money
changers
defiled
the
Jewish
temple
Jesus
drove
them
out
Maybe
it's
time
the
church
cleaned
house
of
those
who
have
forgotten
His
teachings
and
hold
organizations
to
a
standard
higher
than
profit
margins
or
performance
measures
Christians
are
on
this
earth
to
fulfill
the
teachings
of
Jesus
Christ
talk
to
others
about
Him
feed
the
hungry
clothe
the
poor
and
comfort
the
brokenhearted
Members
of
one
organization
won
an
argument
tonight
Somewhere
children
lost
There's
an
overused
cliche
that
seems
somehow
appropriate
here
What
would
Jesus
think
Somehow
I
doubt
He'd
be
pleased
Neither
should
you

MOORE
LIED
Filmmaker
Michael
Moore
admits
that
he
knew
a

Disney
wasn't

his

His
recent
accusations
toward
Disney
A
publicity

Maybe
now

Harry
Knowles
will
shut
up
about
it
He's
been
using
Ain't

Cool
News
to
screech
about
censorship
and
the
administration
Knowles's
reaction
to
Moore's
accusations
really
does
call
into
question
his
credibility
If
he
truly
has
all
the
spies
and
movie
studio
gossip
that
he
claims
then
why
didn't
he
make
a
few
calls
and
verify
Moore's
story
It
would
have
been
simple
for
someone
who
has
as
much
clout
as
he
claims
Ain't
It
Cool
News
is
a
terrible
site
for
many

chronicles
many

Knowles
has
claimed
he
combines
the
enthusiasm
of
a

with
the
job
of
a

If
that's
true
then
he
should
be
willing
to
run
a
correction
of
his
original
story
about
the
Moore-Disney
issue
So
far
that
hasn't
happened
It
probably
won't
as
that
would
mean
upsetting
Moore
and
maybe
not

And
in
the
end
that's
what

all
about

Personal

Democrats
and
Religion
Andrew
Sullivan
is
complaining
once
again
about
the
Catholic
Church
taking
a
strong
stance
on
serving
communion
to
politicians
that
support
and
vote
for
ideologies
contrary
to
church
teachings
Sullivan
says
From
now
on
I
think
it
will
be
harder
and
harder
for
any
sincere
public
Catholic
who
is
a
Democrat
to
continue
to
be
a
part
of
the
sacramental
life
of
the
church
The
Democratic
Party
after
all
is
institutionally
supportive
of
stem-cell
research
the
right
to
abortion
and
at
least
some
recognition
of
gay
couples
Very
few
leading
Democrats
are
pro-life
If
those
issues
are
the
criteria
for
allowing
someone
in
public
life
to
receive
Communion
as
a
Catholic
then
the
Church
in
effect
is
endorsing
one
political
party
over
another.Sullivan
is
trying
to
imply
here
that
people
have
a
right
to
be
a
part
of
a
church
despite
their
willingness
or
unwillingness
to
follow
that
church's
doctrine
This
is
nonsense
Religion
is
about
subjecting
your
will
to
that
of
a
higher
power
Is
Sullivan
suggesting
that
the
church
should
change
to
accommodate
the
beliefs
of
the
Democrat
party
simply
to
avoid
looking
partisan
People
that
are
serious
about
faith
allow
that
faith
to
change
them
instead
of
expecting
it
to
be
the
other
way
around
Sullivan
then
accuses
the
Catholic
heirarchy
of
unwittingly
doing
the
bidding
of
Karl
Rove
who
seems
to
be
the
blogger's
whipping
boy
of
choice
in
the
Bush
admininstration
Frankly
I
don't
know
why
I
continue
to
read
Sullivan
The
guy
is
a
good
writer
but
his
style
has
grown
more
shrill
and
radical
since
the
president
announced
his
support
for
the
federal
marriage
amendment
His
response
to
a
Corner
post
by
Jonah
Goldberg
shows
signs
of
an
increasingly
angry
man
who
doesn't
care
if
he
alienates
those
that
have
been
supportive
of
him
in
the
past
Sullivan
has
been
good
for
conservatives
his
book
on
homosexuality
is
a
must-read
for
conservatives
who
want
to
understand
the
many
facets
of
this
social
issue
I
can
certainly
understand
his
reasons
for
becoming
involved
in
this
issue
I
just
don't
agree
with
his
rhetorical
approach
of
late
as
Goldberg
says
Sullivan
has
become
much
like
those
in
the
gay
movement
he
once
condemned
And
that's
a

Peggy
Noonan
has
a
good
column
today
on
the
humilation
of
Iraqi
prisoners
at
the
Abu
Gharib
prison
The
news
is
bad
the
television
media
has
found
something
new
to
obsess
about
and
like
any
piece
of
bad
news
about
the
war
it's
thrown
Andrew
Sullivan
into
one
of
his
vaguely
anti-Bush
funks
A
few
things
bother
me
about
the
story
One
is
obviously
the
behavior
of
those
US
trooops
involved
The
joy
they
seem
to
be
taking
in
the
humiliation
of
prisoners
under
their
care
is
sickening
I
hope
these
soldiers
are
punished
to
the
full
extent
of
military
law
And
then
they
compound
the
problem
by
taking
pictures
A
friend
of
mine
recently
said
it
seems
as
though
people
doing
illegal
or
unethical
things
always
seem
to
feel
the
need
to
document
their
stupidity
Didn't
these
folks
take
a
moment
to
sit
and
think
or
were
they
proud
of
what
they'd
done
Something
else
that
struck
me
is
the
finely-tuned
sense
of
victimization
the
Arab
world
seems
able
to
summon
at
a
moment's
notice
The
Arab
media
has
routinely
ignored
the
human
rights
atrocities
committed
in
its
region
of
the
world
so-called
honor
killings
slavery
suicide
bombers
religious
persecution
of
non-Muslims
etc
But
give
them
a
chance
to
portray
Arabs
as
the
victims
of
American
imperialism
and
it's
24/7
pictures
of
naked
scrums
on
the
floor
of
an
Iraqi
prison
with
commentary
on
how
evil
America
is
to
allow
such
things
to
happen
Then
there's
the
United
Kickback
Nations
Kofi
Annan
who
allowed
genocide
in
Rwanda
has
called
for
the
US
to
ensure
that
those
kinds
of
activities
are
not
repeated
And
then
he
blamed
it
on
Israel
Okay
I
made
that
last
part
up
but
would
it
really
surprise
anyone
if
such
an
accusation
were
made
The
UN
webpage
features
a
press
release
saying
the
UN's
Human
Rights
body
is
calling
for
the
end
of
the
torture
There's
a
pot-kettle
moment
for
you
Included
in
the
human
rights
commission
of
the
UN
are
Cuba
the
Sudan
and
other
such
champions
of
the
rights
of
man
It
is
nice
to
see
Kofi
so
concerned
about
the
rights
and
well-being
of
Iraqis
Maybe
if
he's
really
lucky
this
news
will
help
drive
the
US
out
of
Iraq
and
allow
a
reasonable
guy
like
Hussein
to
take
over
again
Sure
the
people
of
Iraq
might
not
like
it
but
think
of

Misquoting
God
In
the
New
Testament
book
of
Second
Timothy
it
says
that
All
Scripture
is
breathed
out
by
God
and
profitable
for
teaching
for
reproof
for
correction
and
for
training
in
righteousness
Note
that
Paul
doesn't
add
and
getting
elected
to
the
end
of
the
list
Hugh
Hewitt
has
an
example
of
John
Kerry
trying
to
use
scripture
and
failing
during
a
speech
to
the
Anti-Defamation
League
Love
thy
neighbor
is
not
one
of
the
original
Ten
Commandments
unless
you
count
it
as
Jesus
greatest
commandment
and
it
didn't
seem
to
occur
to
Kerry
that
quoting
Jesus
to
a
largely
Jewish
organization
might
not
be
a
great
idea
Politicians
should
just
stop
trying
to
quote
scripture
to
prove
their
political
points
If
you
use
it
wrong
you're
going
to
make
someone
mad
and
look
foolish
in
the
process
Even
if
you
use
it
in
a
correct
context
you're
going
to
make
someone
mad
and
not
help
yourself
all
that
much
anyway
Scripture
has
its
purposes
The
political
isn't
one
of
them

Veterans
Speak
Out
The
veteran
who
debated
John
Kerry
30
years
ago
about
the
Vietnam
War
has
decided
to
re-enter
the
public
fray
with
an
editorial
in
the
Wall
Street
Journal
In
the
editorial
John
O'Neill
says
John
Kerry
is
unfit
to
be
commander-in-chief
Kerry's
campaign
will
obviously
go
insane
over
such
statements
and
cry
about
having
their
candidate's
patriotism
slandered
once
again
by
the
Republican
Attack
Machine
but
this
was
bound
to
happen
when
Kerry
made
the
decision
to
make
his
Vietnam
service
the
central
focus
of
his
campaign
The
sudden
focus
on
Vietnam
during
this
war
is
yet
another
example
of
the
total
self-absorption
of
the
elite
boomers
Ted
Kennedy
John
Kerry
Ted
Koppel
their
backwards-looking
nostalgia
trips
blind
them
to
the
fact
that
this
war
is
not
Vietnam
these
times
are
not
analogous
to
the
tumult
of
the
late
60s
and
early
70s
When
Kennedy
fulminates
that
this
war
is
Bush's
Vietnam
I
don't
see
a
wise
older
statesman
making
a
historical
analogy
I
see
a
confused
old
man
who
doesn't
understand
these
times
trying
to
fit
current
events
into
a
mental
template
formed
in
his
youth
When
Koppel
reads
the
name
of
the
Iraq
war
dead
I
don't
see
a
broadcaster
making
a
tribute
to
fallen
soldiers
I
see
a
television
journalist
stealing
ideas
from
print
media
to
get
big
ratings
during
sweeps
week
Maybe
I'm
too
cynical
That
could
be
argued
What
I
really
am
though
is
tired
I'm
tired
of
the
elitism
of
the
previous
generation
and
their
stubborn
refusal
to
grow
out
of
the
ideas
formed
in
their
youth
The
Kennedys
Kerrys
and
Koppels
are
turning
into
caricatures
that
resemble
Dana
Carvey's
grumpy
old
man
Bringing
up
Vietnam
is
their
equivalent
of
in
my
day
Needless
to
say
things
aren't
the
same
and
it's
long
past
time
for
them
to
get
a
new
line
or
get
out
of
the
way
of
those
who
do
understand
the
times
we're
in
and
who
lead
based
on
current
events
and
not
old
memories

At
Least
They're
Consistent
A
few
years
ago
a
student
at
a
university
in
the
state
committed
suicide
by
jumping
out
of
the
fourth-floor
window
of
the
dormitory
Suicides
are
not
normally
news
but
the
local
media
showed
up
en
masse
and
took
pictures
of
the
police
investigation
the
crowds
of
students
milling
around
and
even
the
blood
spot
on
the
sidewalk
where
the
young
student
hit
The
Bangor
Daily
News
ran
a
large
picture
of
the
public
safety
officers
measuring
the
angle
from
the
window
to
the
impact
point
So
it's
with
no
surprise
that
I
read
the
BDN
editorial
about
the
flag-draped
coffin
controversy
The
editors
of
the
Bangor
Daily
argue
that
the
media
should
be
allowed
to
take
pictures
of
the
returning
war
dead
as
they
arrive
in
the
United
States
Somehow
intruding
on
a
family's
private
grief
falls
under
what
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
The
Bangor
Daily
editors
also
erroneously
report
this
is
a
Bush
administration
ban
when
in
fact
the
ban
has
been
in
place
since
the
other
Bush
administration
and
remained
in
place
throughout
the
Clinton
administration
But
hey
anything
to
make
Bush
look
bad
What
are
facts
to
opinion
editors
The
administration
should
force
the
media
to
explain
why
they
want
to
see
pictures
of
the
war
dead
and
ignore
the
boilerplate
reasoning
of
the
right
to
know
What
possible
news
value
exists
in
the
pictures
of
people
coming
back
in
flag-draped
coffins
other
than
to
increase
the
suffering
of
those
who
have
lost
a
loved
one
The
death
of
the
soldier
has
already
been
reported
the
story
is
over
The
BDN
admits
the
ceremony
is
dignified
Why
make
it
less
so
by
allowing
jostling
bands
of
cameramen
and
reporters
to
use
the
war
dead
as
just
another
headline
I
was
there
the
day
the
student
killed
herself
as
I
worked
for
the
university
I
watched
the
paramedics
try
to
save
the
student
and
saw
the
photographers
and
reporters
taking
pictures
and
hectoring
students
and
employees
still
in
shock
about
what
had
happened
The
BDN
was
among
them
I
see
their

values
have
not
changed

Today
I
got
in
a
conversation
with
a
guy
I've
gotten
to
know
there
In
the
past
we've
talked
about
travel
Maine
taxes
and
of
course
the
weather
Today
we
talked
politics
He's
a
baby
boomer
so
he
brought
up
John
Kerry's
service
in
the
Vietnam
War
as
proof
of
the
senator's
good
character
According
to
The
Best
of
the
Web
Today
on
Opinion
Journal
in
one
24-hour
period
Kerry
invoked
his
service
in
Vietnam
To
fend
off
attacks
by
his
Republican
rivals
As
evidence
he
will
fight
to
expand
healthcare
As
evidence
he
understands
the
complicated
landscape
in
Iraq
To
explain
his
love
of
peanut
butter-and-jelly
sandwiches.I
understand
the
importance
of
the
Vietnam
War
in
the
collective
experience
of
the
baby
boom
generation
but
frankly
it
doesn't
matter
to
me
that
much
Vietnam
was
one
of
many
conflicts
in
which
the
United
States
has
fought
and
it
ended
when
I
was
three
years
old
I
can
empathize
with
the
fear
and
uncertainty
of
the
times
and
with
the
loss
of
life
that
war
caused
Still
though
who
served
in
the
war
and
who
didn't
doesn't
matter
to
me
all
that
much
no
matter
the
party
affiliation
of
the
politicians
involved
In
other
words
I
would
feel
the
same
way
if
the
roles
of
Bush
and
Kerry
were
reversed
The
Vietnam
War
ended
nearly
30
years
ago
While
I
admire
John
Kerry's
willingness
to
serve
his
country
in
wartime
that
service
doesn't
really
excuse
his
record
on
national
security
matters
since
then
Nor
does
it
protect
Kerry
from
having
to
explain
what
he'll
do
if
he
is
elected
president
something
he
has
not
yet
done
with
any
specificity
His
record
on
military
matters
apart
from
his
service
in
a
war
are
not
encouraging
His
constant
focus
on
multilateralism
and
his
willingness
to
depend
on
the
deeply
corrupt
United
Nations
are
not
a
good
indicator
of
his
judgment
in
foreign
affairs
In
other
words
Kerry's
Vietnam
service
is
admirable
but
just
not
that
relevant
to
voters
my
age
who
don't
remember
the
war
and
who
want

to
discuss
the

God
and
Politics
As
readers
of
this
blog
know
I'm
a
supporter
of
President
Bush
But
even
I
have
to
protest
the
president's
latest
actions
His
order
to
arrest
the
leaders
of
the
pro-abortion
movement
and
sign
an
executive
order
making
abortion
illegal
were
a
clear
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
The
loyalty
oath
to
Bush
and
Jesus
Christ
that
we
all
have
to
sign
now
or
be
considered
citizens
of
concern
is
an
outrage
Obviously
none
of
that
really
happened
But
after
reading
this
guy's
critique
of
the
President's
faith
I
wondered
whether
I'd
missed
some
big
news
about
a
crackdown
by
Bush
on
the
non-religious
Allow
me
to
fisk
for
a
bit
Warning
this
one
is
long
Evangelical
lobbyists
used
to
talk
about
access
to
previous
Republican
administrations
Today
they
can
say
with
confidence
Who
needs
access
when
we
are
already
on
the
inside
The
influence
of
the
Christian
right
on
the
Bush
White
House
is
self-evident
As
well
as
George
Bush
cabinet
members
Condoleezza
Rice
John
Ashcroft
and
Don
Evans
all
consider
themselves
to
be
born
again
This
administration
has
embarked
on
a
bold
agenda
to
roll
back
liberalism
in
the
US
and
won't
let
up
if
it
gets
a
second
term.Philip
James
starts
by
promptly
obeying
the
first
rule
of
alarmist
column-writing
make
up
a
quote
that
may
not
have
actually
been
said
but
that
you
just
know
is
true
The
scarier
the
better
And
what's
juicier
than
saying
the
evangelicals
no
longer
need
to
storm
the
gate
because
they're
ALREADY
THERE
Heh
If
that
one's
doesn't

Bob
Shrum

his
coffee
over

breakfast
table
nothing
will
Note
how
he
says
liberalism
will
be
rolled
back
in
the
United
States
That's
because
liberalism=human
progress
you
know
When
Reagan
was
in
office
people
were
barely
conscious
We
were
all
just
drooling
idiots
staring
at
images
on
a
cave
wall
Thank...well
not
God
but
you
know
the
IDEA
of
God
that
Clinton
got
in
when
he
did
or
this
country
may
never
have
recovered
from
the
huge
steps
backward
we
took
The
September
11
attacks
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
have
overshadowed
Bush's
conservative
domestic
agenda
but
it
should
not
go
overlooked
by
voters
as
we
approach
the
November
elections
Bush's
self-description
as
a
compassionate
conservative
belies
a
much
harsher
reality
And
as
America's
attention
has
been
focused
on
historic
events
overseas
the
ground
at
home
has
shifted
just
as
dramatically
The
administration
is
acutely
aware
of
the
power
of
the
Christian
voting
block
in
the
US
Gallup
surveys
consistently
count
46
of
the
population
as
being
self-described
born
again
Christians
the
bulk
of
whom
live
in
middle
America
It
is
a
stunning
statistic
and
one
that
escapes
the
attention
of
the
chattering
classes
who
populate
the
much
less
devout
coastal
strips
Many
of
these
churchgoers
voted
for
Bush
in
2000
and
Carl
Rove
is
determined
that
all
of
them
should
do
the
same
this
year
The
latest
data
should
put
a
spring
in
his
step
Bush's
job
approval
among
grassroots
Christian
social
conservatives
hovers
between
92
and
96%.You
can
just
hear
the
chattering
classes
now
can't
you
Middle
America
What
is
he
talking
about...oh
the
part
we
fly
over
There
are
states
down
there
Egad
And
I
just
don't
know
where
he's
getting
those
figures
There
can't
be
that
many
born
agains
in
the
United
States
After
all
I've
never
met
one
Imagine
the
horror
churched
people
voting
for
someone
with
whom
they
agree
And
disagreeing
with
something
so
self-evidently
true
as
liberal
doctrine
The
nerve
If
Bush
wins
the
election
it
will
mean
that
after
30
years
as
the
law
of
the
land
a
woman's
right
to
choose
to
have
an
abortion
will
be
under
serious
threat
The
ultimate
goal
of
the
Christian
right
is
to
overturn
Roe
versus
Wade
the
landmark
1973
decision
enshrining
a
woman's
right
to
choose
In
the
likely
event
of
one
of
the
ageing
supremes
stepping
down
in
the
next
few
years
the
balance
of
power
in
the
US
supreme
court
will
be
up
for
grabs
and
Bush
will
not
hesitate
to
nominate
a
pro-life
candidate
Having
already
signed
a
ban
on
late
term
abortions
he
believes
he
has
the
momentum
on
this
issue
If
he
wins
he
has
four
more
years
in
which
to
push
a
constitutional
amendment
to
protect
marriage
from
same-sex
unions
He
will
not
have
to
weigh
pre-election
expediency
against
his
belief
that
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do.Once
again
note
the

v
Wade
enshrines
the
right
to
an
abortion
in
the
United
States
It's
not
law
it's
Holy
Writ
It
can
never
be
altered
never
be
changed
The
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
decided
that
and
that
settles
it
And
they
never
make
a
mistake
You
can
just
hear
John
Kerry
now
as
he
reads
this
Um
buddy...Ixnay
on
the
amesay-exsay
arrigemay
We're
not
talking
about
that
right
now
With
60
percent
of
the
country
supporting
the
federal
amendment
to
define
marriage
this
is
hardly
a
case
of
Bush
pushing
his
extremist
agenda
on
the
rest
of
us
But
wait
There's
more
If
Bush
wins
it
will
mean
four
more
years
of
Middle
East
policy
influenced
by
the
evangelical
belief
that
the
Messiah
will
not
return
until
Israel
rebuilds
a
temple
on
the
site
of
the
al-Aqsa
mosque
in
Jerusalem
Did
I
miss
something
Did
Bush
allow
Israel
to
take
over
the
temple
mount
and
start
building
If
not
what
the
heck
is
this
guy
talking
about
It
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
there
is
not
much
daylight
between
the
beliefs
of
hardcore
evangelicals
and
the
Bush
White
House
When
asked
during
the
1999
Iowa
caucus
debate
who
his
favourite
philosopher
was
Bush
replied
Jesus
At
the
time
pundits
thought
this
was
a
canny
signal
to
grassroots
religious
voters
from
a
sophisticated
campaigner
It
was
but
what
people
didn't
realise
at
the
time
is
that
Bush
actually
believes
it
as
well
The
story
of
how
he
found
faith
at
the
bottom
of
a
whisky
glass
was
thought
to
be
a
rote
rallying
yarn
intended
strictly
for
the
Republican
faithful
during
the
campaign
However
Bush
has
passionately
and
consistently
repeated
the
story
at
after-dinner
speeches
throughout
his
time
in
office
He
dispelled
any
doubts
about
the
strength
of
his
Christian
faith
during
his
last
press
conference
on
Iraq
when
he
made
it
clear
that
God
was
personally
directing
him
to
fundamentally
reshape
the
Arab
world.I
love
this
part
The
surprise
the
conspiritorial
language
Bush
actually
believes
this
Christianity
stuff
And
other
people
that
actually
believe
this
Christianity
stuff
support
him
You
can
practically
hear
James's
thoughts
Did
we
return
to
the
Dark
Ages
while
I
was
watching
Sex
and
the
City
And
now
the
triumphant
finish
As
surely
as
fundamentalism
has
kept
much
of
the
Islamic
world
in
a
state
of
cultural
regression
so
the
fundamentalists
of
the
US
threaten
to
do
the
same
thing
in
the
States
John
Kerry
should
steal
a
powerful
line
from
Bush's
speech
on
Iraq
and
rephrase
it
thus
Now
is
the
time
and
America
is
the
place
where
the
forces
of
fundamentalism
are
arraigned
against
the
forces
of
enlightenment
He
should
make
this
election
about
a
choice
between
two
visions
one
that
wants
to
take
the
country
to
a
dark
puritanical
tyranny
as
opposed
to
one
that
wants
to
restore
the
US
as
a
light
unto
nations
a
place
of
freedom
diversity
and
opportunity
And
he
should
fire
up
women
voters
the
one
voting
block
that
rivals
the
size
of
the
born-agains
and
tell
them
If
you
want
to
protect
your
right
to
choose
make
sure
you
choose
correctly
in
November.'Reading
this
part
of
the
column
I
got
angry
I
go
to
church
every
week
Did
I
miss
the
meeting
or
announcement
about
our
imminent
plan
to
take
over
the
country
and
return
it
to
puritanical
rule
Darn
it
all
I
really
should
pay
more
attention
during
that
part
of
the
service
I
would
pay
money
to
hear
John
Kerry
speak
out
against
Christinanity
like
that
James
really
doesn't
think
that
a
vast
majority
of
Americans
do
believe
in
God
They
may
not
be
evangelicals
but
most
of
us
at
least
believe
in
a
higher
power
of
some
sort
If
Kerry
made
a
speech
like
that
it
would
be
political
suicide
Philip
James
is
a
bigot
His
hatred
for
all
things
Christian
drips
from
every
word
of
these
ridiculous
last
paragraphs
When
he
looks
at
Christians
he
obviously
sees
a
subhuman
class
of
people
that
he
just
cannot
believe
are
actually
allowed
a
place
in
the
public
square
James's
rage
is
not
backed
up
with
any
facts
whatsoever
I
think
what
makes
him
most
angry
though
is
that
we
aren't
doing
the
things
of
which
he's
accused
us
We're
not
acting
like
we're
supposed
to
act
and
thus
not
proving
his
prejudices
What
do
they
say
about
prejudice
That
it's
rooted
in
ignorance
I
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
Philip
James
has
never
taken
the
time
to
get
to
know
an
evangelical
His
knowledge
of
them
is
anecdotal
from
pieces
in
the
New
York
Times
and
Washington
Post
or
what
he's
seen
in
the
political
realm
James
believes
his
hatred
is
justified
by
the
hatred
he's
seen
or
experienced
from
the
few
evangelicals
he
does
know
It's
justified
by
the
actions
real
or
imagined
of
Bush
Rice
and
Ashcroft
It's
justified
because
he's
right
he's
enlightened
and
we're
just
wrong
What
James
doesn't
realize
is
that
behind
all
of
the
justifications
he's
still
a
hater
So
who
is
this
guy
We
get
that
at
the
end
Philip
James
is
a
former
senior
Democratic
party
strategist.You

Double-Bashing
from
the
BDN
Today's
Bangor
Daily
News
features
a
story
about
a
satellite
conference
between
UMaine
students
and
college
students
in
Palestine
organized
by
a
professor
of
social
studies
education
at
UMaine
The
article
gives
the
professor
ample
opportunity
to
condemn
US
media
coverage
of
the
Israeli-Palestinian
conflict
and
throws
in
a
comment
about
No
Child
Left
Behind
just
for
good
measure
The
professor
Edward
Jadallah
says
he
organized
the
conference
to
look
at
the
issue
from
a
global
standpoint
and
to
get
past
perceptions
often
created
by
biased
media
according
to
the
BDN
story
My
first
thought
about
this
conference
is
given
the
budget
constraints
the
university
operates
under
who
paid
for
this
undoubtedly
expensive
satellite
communication
If
it
was
money
from
the
University
doesn't
it
stand
to
reason
that
more
of
an
effort
could
have
been
made
to
present
a
balanced
view
of
the
problems
in
that
part
of
the
world
The
Palestinians
dutifully
quoted
by
the
reporter
complain
about
the
curfews
the
checkpoints
and
the
wall
being
constructed
by
the
Israeli
government
One
even
admits
that
some
Palestinians
who
have
lost
their
homes
their
families
and
their
loved
ones
don't
know
what
else
to
do
but
strap
a
vest
of
explosives
onto
their
chest
to
go
kill
some
Israelis
Almost
makes
it
sound
reasonable
doesn't
it
I
mean
when
faced
with
a
similar
situation
who
wouldn't
go
out
and
kill
some
people
eating
pizza
or
riding
a
bus
No
mention
was
made
in
the
article
about
the
956
people
killed
by
Palestinian
suicide
bombers
since
2000
That
list
includes
Shalhevet
Tehiya
Pass
a
10-month
old
little
girl
who
was
killed
by
a
Palestinian
sniper
She
was
in
a
stroller
being
pushed
by
her
parents
on
her
way
to
visit
her
grandparents
Or
Mordechai
Schijveschuurder
who
was
killed
along
with
his
wife
Tzira
and
three
of
his
children
Ra'aya
Yitzhak
and
Hemda
as
they
sat
eating
pizza
at
a
Sbarro's
in
Jerusalem
Then
there's
Edward
Bakshayev
who
was
killed
while
protecting
his
family
against
a
terrorist
who
entered
his
step-granddaughter's
bat
mitzvah
celebration
and
opened
fire
with
an
automatic
rifle.There
have
been
so
many
victims
that
it's
easy
to
forget
their
names
and
faces
while
calling
for
moral
equivalence
between
them
and
their
murderers
Professor
Jaballah
says
he
wants
to
organize
more
conferences
to
emphasize
the
need
for
this
type
of
global
learning
What
are
the
chances
that
next
time
he'll
bring
along
some
Israelis
to
talk
about
the
fear
and
suffering
caused
by
those
Palestinians
who
had
no
choice
but
to
become
suicide
bombers
Also
why
didn't
any
of
the
conference
attendees
ask
the
Palestinians
why
more
of
an
attempt
isn't
made
by
the
Palestinian
people
to
stop
terrorist
attacks
against
Israel
The
wall
the
curfew
the
checkpoints
Israel
has
not
taken
these
actions
just
to
make
life
miserable
for
Palestinians
Certainly
an
educator
seeking
to
provide
context
and
a
rounded
view
would
ask
such
questions
After
all
anything
else
would
be
propaganda
right

Not
content
with
angry
marches
and
misleading
television
commercials
the
left
has
decided
to
try
another
tactic
to
criticize
President
George
W
Bush
The
New
York
Times
is
reporting
that
groups
are
organizing
on
the
internet
and
encouraging
liberals
to
volunteer
for
the
GOP
Convention
with
the
idea
of
disrupting
it
from
the
inside
Since
President
Bush
won
the
election
in
2000
there
has
been
an
amazing
level
of
hatred
for
the
man
I
know
I've
commented
on
it
many
times
before
but
it
still
surprises
me
just
how
much
pure
vitriol
some
in
the
Democrat
party
can
produce
for
the
president
What
is
more
surprising
and
disappointing
is
how
the
leaders
of
that
party
have
refused
to
confront
the
haters
in
their
ranks
John
Kerry
shows
no
intention
of
saying
a
word
against
groups
such
as
MoveOn.org
or
the
organizers
of
the
pro-abortion
march
in
Washington
no
matter
what
these
people
say
Does
Kerry's
silence
indicate
agreement
Does
John
Kerry
think
it's
fair
to
compare
Bush
to
Hitler
or
for
pro-abortion
activists
to
say
that
the
only
allies
this
administration
has
are
the
Pope
and
Islamic
extremists
If
not
why
doesn't
he
speak
out
against
the
rhetoric
employed
by
his
political
supporters
It's
going
to
get
worse
as
the
election
nears
John
Kerry
after
saying
we
shouldn't
care
about
who
served
in
Vietnam
and
who
didn't
when
Clinton
was
in
office
is
now
trying
to
recycle
the
Bush
AWOL
story
from
a
few
months
ago
Despite
his
many
errors
though
Kerry
has
not
suffered
the
media
assault
that
Bush
has
undergone
over
issue
after
issue
The
president
cannot
depend
on
the
media
to
get
his
message
out
Now
as
the
election
kicks
into
gear
and
starts
getting
nasty
the
president
needs
your
help
more
than
ever
Please
volunteer
or
donate
to
the
re-election
campaign
If
you're
a
blogger
join
the
growing
coalition
of
those
who
want
to
see
Bush
defeat
Kerry

The

unflattering

with

severe

Yup
We
get

commercial
ends
with
Determined
Old

supported
by

saying
the
government
will
have
to
arrest
him
if
they
end
up
making
Canada

illegal

for
purchasing
the
drugs
he
needs
The
commercial
ignores
of
course
the
expensive
prescription
drug
benefit
that
Congress
just
passed
and
the
president
signed
into
law
Oh
well
Politics
proves
that
one
shouldn't
let
facts
confuse
one
whose
mind
is
made
up
Still
though
does
that
mean
it's
okay
to
scare
the
crap
out
of
old
people
to
get
votes
Of
course
anyone
watching
the
commercial
who
believes
the
U.S
government
is
going
to
lock
up
grammy
and
grampy
just
because
they're
jumping
the
border
to
get
drugs
is
not
going
to
be
convinced
that
Bush
is
not
an
ogre
as
they
are
likely
of
the
rabid
anti-Bush
contingent
Such
people
only
need
be
thrown
piles
of
steaming
red
meat
and
Michael
Moore
books
once
in
awhile
until
November
when
they
are
unleashed
to
vote
The
commercial
highlights
the
difference
between
supporters
of
John
Kerry
and
those
of
the
president
Kerry
and
his
supporters
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
scaring
the
living
daylights
out
of
people
to
get
them
to
vote
against
George
W
Bush
The
level
of
enthusiasm
for
Kerry
is
rather
low
when
compared
to
that
of
supporters
for
the
president
And
that
could
make
all
the
difference
in

Kerry
Meltdown
The
Kerry
campaign
is
about
to
have
a
very
bad
few
days
according
to
Hugh
Hewitt
The
throwing
medals
story
has
come
back
to
bite
Kerry
in
true
Watergate
fashion
The
focus
of
the
controversy
is
not
that
a
young
John
Kerry
threw
medals
over
the
White
House
fence
in
protest
it's
that
his
statements
about
that
act
of
defiance
just
don't
add
up
What's
more
sad
is
that
Kerry's
first
response
is
to
blame
the
entire
controversy
on
the
fabled
and
seemingly
omnipotent
Republican
Attack
Machine
The
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
at
some
point
in
his
life
Kerry
lied
when
he
should
have
told
the
truth
Since
then
he's
had
to
lie
to
cover
up
his
lie
and
the
whole
mess
has
caught
up
with
him
As
in
Watergate
it's
not
the
action
that's
the
problem
it's
the
cover
up
This
entire
episode
shows
the
general
weakness
of
John
Kerry
Life
becomes
problematic
when
you
do
things
out
of
calculation
instead
of
conviction
His
lies
about
his
anti-war
actions
now
cast
doubt
on
whether
he
really
opposed
the
war
at
all
or
was
he
just
going
with
the
prevailing
political
sentiment
at
the
time
to
get
himself
elected
to
something
Most
of
the
problems
Kerry
finds
himself
in
are
a
result
of
his
political
calculation
not
his
personal
convictions
Voting
for
the
war
and
against
the
funding
voting
for
the
patriot
act
but
now
opposing
it
voting
for
No
Child
Left
Behind
but
now
claiming
to
hate
the
law
This
constant
litany
of
action
and
retraction
the
constant
clarifications
they
all
lead
to
one
question
What
does
John

believe

is
Severance

he's
not

with
the

overall
template

is
helpfully
stated
by
the

Maine
has
a
serious
air
quality
problem

the
Bush

policies
announced
last

will
only
make

disingenuously

No
direct
quote
to
this
effect

you
know
it's
so
true
that
we
don't
really
need
to
check
it
right
I
mean
everyone
knows
that
the
Bush
administration
is
terror
on
the
environment
Personally
I
think
these
groups
may
be
onto
something
When
one
stands
at
the
top
of
Cadillac
Mountain
in
Acadia
there
is
sometimes
a

haze
in

that
isn't
quite
smog

definitely
not

The

no

may
be

In

political

is

saying
it's
no

Wrong
Were

Mrs
Kerry's
wealth
John
Kerry
would
not
be
the

The
campaign
had
to
borrow
against
the
value
of
a
house
jointly
owned
by
the
couple
to
finance
the
senator's
presidential
run
when
his

Her
wealth

If

that's
a
legitimate

Sabato
says
the

is
silly
when
compared
to
issues
such
as
the
economy

national
security
That
doesn't
make
it

We
should
know
who

Bush
and
the
Environment
President
Bush
visited
the
southern
end
of
Maine
yesterday
for
an
Earth
Day
speech
Predictably
environmental
groups
were
not
happy
with
his
visit
Brownie
Carson
of
the
Natural
Resources
Council
of
Maine
said
the
following
This
administration
has
undertaken
a
concerted
systematic
very
vigorous
effort
to
undermine
or
repeal
every
important
environmental
law
protecting
the
people
and
the
environment
of
the
United
States.In
one
sentence
Carson
has
demonstrated
why
the
environment
is
becoming
less
of
a
political
concern
for
Americans
environmental
groups
have
made
it
difficult
to
take
them
seriously
anymore
Consider
Carson's
statement
She's
saying
President
Bush
and
his
cronies
are
purposely
for
nefarious
reasons
doubtless
having
something
to
do
with
Halliburton
taking
apart
every
important
environmental
law
No
we're
concerned
about
this
administration's
environmental
record
or
there
are
areas
where
we
disagree
None
of
those
half-measures
for
Carson
She
wants
you
to
know
the
president
is
trying
to
KILL
YOU
AND
YOUR
FAMILY
This
is
nothing
new
for
environmentalists
For
over
twenty
years
they
have
been
trying
to
scare
the
American
people
into
thinking
the
sky
is
falling
That
soon
the
skies
will
cloud
over
with
smog
and
the
water
will
be
undrinkable
Of
course
that's
only
if
the
massive
floods
from
global
warming
don't
drown
us
all
first
People
like
Carson
and
her
merry
band
of
Chicken
Littles
have
kept
this
shtick
up
so
long
that
people
just
don't
take
it
seriously
anymore
We'll
put
up
with
paying
300
for
a
catalytic
converter
or
double-flushing
a
low-flow
toilet
We
recycle
use
non-CDC
producing
aerosol
products
and
buy
dolphin-safe
tuna
We
change
where
common
sense
tells
us
we
should
The
reason
for
Gallup's
poll
numbers
I
think
is
that
most
of
us
are
just
sick
to
death
of
being
told
we're
all
going
to
die
or
listening
to
environmental
groups
tell
us
our
leaders
are
murderous
fiends
who
are
dismantling
everything
sacred
about
the
law
What
such
groups
seem
to
ignore
is
that
Americans
are
actually
really
conscious
of
the
environment
When
I
was
in
Russia
last
summer
I
saw
more
littering
than
I've
seen
since
the
Native
American
cried
in
that
commercial
I
saw
huge
power
plants
with
tons
of
smoke
coming
out
of
the
chimneys
and
clouds
of
exhaust
coming
from
automobiles
People
there
thought
nothing
of
chopping
down
a
tree
or
a
few
for
a
bonfire
or
draining
showers
and
toilets
into
a
field
What
would
not
be
allowed
in
America
is
routine
in
Russia
And
yet
we're
condescended
to
by
the
environmental
scolds
who
tell
us
we're
the
worst
offenders
toward
the
environment
I'm
not
a
big
outdoorsman
but
I
appreciate
the
environment
I
see
it
as
a
stewardship
issue
God
created
this
planet
and
I
get
the
feeling
He
doesn't
want
us
to
mistreat
it
And
overall
that's
what
America
is
doing
So
don't
tell
us
we're
killing
ourselves
and
each
other
and
use
junk
science
to
scare
us
into
doing
what
you
want
Americans
are
commonsense
people
who
want
real
solutions
not
overheated
words

Danby
I
love
most
things
about
living
in
Maine
The
two
exceptions
are
the
winter
weather
and
the
local
media
The
best
thing
about
the
web
for
me
is
that
I
can
read
national
newspapers
instead
of
the
local
rag
the
Bangor
Daily
News
As
small-city
papers
go
the
BDN
isn't
terrible
some
of
the
reporting
is
great
and
the
paper
does
a
good
job
of
covering
the
region
and
state
The
major
problem
with
the
Bangor
Daily
is
its
editorial
page
Or
to
be
more
specific
George
Danby
Danby
is
the
editorial
cartoonist
for
the
BDN
and
his
specialty
is
poorly-drawn
caricatures
with
floating
pieces
of
paper
in
the
foreground
These
floating
papers
have
comments
on
them
which
are
supposed
to
help
explain
the
cartoon
Today's
cartoon
is
a
good
example
of
Danby's
subtle
style
George
W
Bush
is
shown
standing
in
front
of
a
beautiful
Maine
backdrop
Behind
the
backdrop
is
a
picture
of
smog
and
midwest
pollution
Get
it
Maine's
air
is
really
so
unbreathable
and
Maine
is
so
polluted
thanks
to
Bush's
policies
that
he
has
to
fake
a
backdrop
of
a
beautiful
state
Isn't
that
great
Isn't
that
funny
Because
you
know
Maine
really
does
have
great
big
clouds
of
midwest
pollution
hanging
over
its
major
cities
ruining
the
scenic
vistas
and
killing
off
the
wildlife
Three
and
a
half
years
of
George
W
Bush
have
turned
this
state
from
vacationland
into
a
post-apocalyptic
nightmare
Oh
and
just
in
case
you
didn't
get
the
joke
a
Danby
paper
explainer
is
there
for
you
It
says
Bush
Clean
air
Don't
hold
your
breath
Stop
George...you're
killing
me
Another
Danby
classic
shows
a
plane
piloted
by
the
president
with
the
words
Mideast
Peace
written
on
it
The
cartoon
titled
The
A-Bomb
shows
the
plane
dropping
a
bomb
with
the
name
Ariel
Sharon
on
it
Because
in
the
world
of
George
Danby
Ariel
Sharon
is
the
REAL
threat
to
peace
in
the
mideast
not
the
dozens
of
Palestinian
suicide
bombers
that
kill
innocent
Israelis
These
are
only
a
couple
of
examples
of
the
overwhelming
mediocrity
of
George
Danby
Actually
mediocrity
would
be
an
improvement
The
BDN
should
really
find
someone
with
an
original
voice
instead
of
settling
for
what
we
have
now
Find
a
young
libertarian
who
isn't
afraid
to
take
shots
at
both
sides
instead
of
the
constant
litany
of
inspid
liberalism
that
Danby
brings
to

page

Defining
Kerry
Senator
John
Kerry
has
just
begun
a
huge
and
telling
ad
buy
in
a
number
of
states
Maine
is
unfortunately
one
of
those
states
so
I've
seen
some
of
the
new
advertisements
The
problem
for
Kerry
is
that
Gore
won
many
of
the
states
where
he
now
finds
himself
having
to
spend
money
Maine
Michigan
Pennsylvania
Iowa
New
Mexico
Oregon
Wisconson
Minnesota
and
Washington
Kerry
partisans
claim
that
Kerry
is
buying
the
advertisements
to
introduce
himself
to
voters
that
don't
know
him
Kerry
first
announced
he
was
forming
an
exploratory
committee
in
December
of
2002
He
has
been
essentially
running
for
president
since
then
Why
wouldn't
people
know
him
There's
a
very
simple
reason
he
hasn't
told
us
a
single
thing
about
John
Kerry
Since
announcing
his
intentions
to
seek
the
presidency
John
Kerry
has
told
us
two
things
over
and
over
again
1
He
served
in
Vietnam
2
He
really
doesn't
like
George
Bush.The
Bush
campaign
realized
this
was
Kerry's
weakness
and
took
the
opportunity
to
define
Kerry
with
their
own
advertisements
It
seems
to
have
worked
for
now
Despite
having
a
bad
month
the
Bush
campaign
is
climbing
in
recent
polls
John
Kerry
misjudged
the
amount
of
Anybody
But
Bush
sentiment
in
the
United
States
and
chose
to
pander
to
the
angry
left
instead
of
using
the
primary
season
and
the
free
media
coverage
to
tell
voters
about
who
he
was
and
what
he
wanted
to
do
for
America
Even
after
it
was
apparent
he
would
win
the
Democrat
nomination
Kerry
continued
to
bash
President
Bush
in
speech
after
speech
telling
the
voters
nothing
they
haven't
heard
before
Even
now
Kerry
eagerly
jumps
on
any
bit
of
news
that
reflects
badly
on
President
Bush
the
Plame
story
AWOL
allegations
Clarke's
book
Saudi
oil
deals
The
White
House
was
distracted
by
each
of
these
stories
Kerry
should
have
used
that
time
to
offer
himself
as
an
alternative
by
telling
us
what
he
believed
Instead
he
joined
in
the
festivities
every
time
Kerry's
latest
effort
to
define
himself
brings
me
to
a
simple
conclusion
John
Kerry
is
running
for
president
because
he
wants
to
be
president
Not
because
he
feels
he
has
a
vision
for
America
or
any
ideas
that
he
wants
to
implement
In
the
absence
of
ideas
his
ambition
is
showing
And

see
it

would
Gere
have
to
say
in
order
for
his
comments
to
be
called
standard
and
boring
The
Emmys
the
Oscars
the
Grammys
at
all
of
these
events
it's
almost
a
sure
thing
that
viewers
will
be
subjected
to
some
sort
of
anti-conservative
anti-religious
vitriol
from
the
celebrities
at
the
podium
What's
surprising
is
not
that
these
comments
are
broadcast
by
courageous
networks
but
that
most
of
the
comments
are
so
consistently
banal
That
such
boilerplate
is
always
seen
at
events
where
Hollywood
is
celebrating
its
own
creativity
makes
the
quality
of
the
comments
even
more
pathetic
Since
Bush
took
office
the
celebrity
left
has
felt
more
free
to
include
anti-conservative
comments
in
awards
shows
in
movies
and
in
books
All
while
whining
about
the
increasing
limits
put
on
speech
of
course
After
forcing
their
views
on
a
public
that
just
wants
to
be
entertained
by
these
dolts
they
praise
their
own
courage
in
taking
a
stand
for
free
speech
creativity
blah...blah...blah
Frankly
I
could
do
with
a
little
less
courage
from
celebrities
and
a
little
more
creativity
Because
pretty
soon
they're
going
to
run
out
of
70s
television
shows
to
remake
into
movies

In
his
criticisms
of
President
Bush's
Iraq
policy
John
Kerry
is
fond
of
telling
voters
that
he
will
give
the
United
Nations
a
more
active
role
in
the
rebuilding
of
that
country
We
should
establish
an
international
mission
authorized
by
the
UN
to
work
with
the
interim
government
on
governance
issues
including
elections
and
the
reconstruction
of
Iraq
and
rebuilding
the
Iraqi
economy.I
cannot
help
but
wonder
whether
officials
at
the
United
Nations
if
they
were
given
the
authority
to
rebuild
the
economy
under
the
Kerry
plan
will
pick
up
where
they
left
off
in
taking
money
from
the
people
of
Iraq
There
is
growing
evidence
that
the
United
Nations
is
a
deeply
corrupt
organization
Given
what
we
know
now
about
the
Oil-for-Food
program
the
UN's
refusal
to
help
the
United
States
rid
the
Iraqi
people
of
Saddam
Hussein
is
now
cast
in
a
new
light
They
didn't
care
about
the
Iraqi
people
only
about
the
money
that
Saddam
Hussein
could
give
them
This
is
the
organization
that
John
Kerry
thinks
should
have
more
authority
in
Iraq
Senator
Kerry's
blind
trust
in
multinational
organizations
is
a
troubling
sign
of
his
judgment
Kerry
believes
the
only
way
to
make
our
mission
in
Iraq
legitimate
is
to
allow
the
United
Nations
to
take
over
The
Bush
administration
believes
the
United
Nations
can
be
of
assistance
but
has
so
far
refused
efforts
to
allow
a
UN
takeover
The
latest
news
coming
out
of
that
organization
shows
us
that
President
Bush's
instincts
were
correct
John
Kerry
believes
corrupt
multinational
groups
confer
more
legitimacy
than
the
United
States
President
Bush
has
taken
action
to
depose
a
dictator
and
free
a
people
instead
of
leaving
him
in
power
and
keeping
Iraqis
living
under
tyranny
Kerry's
lack
of
judgment
in
this
matter
should
leave
people
with
serious
doubts
about
his
ability
to
handle
the
foreign
policy
of
the
United
States
He
cares
more
about
what
crooks
in
France
Germany
and
the
United

think
of
us
than
about
doing
what's
right

Maine's

State
of

animal
welfare
agents
have
seized
25
animals
from
the

of
Pembroke's
animal
control
officer
The
animals
had
been
living
in
extremely
filthy
conditions
according
to
those
who
rescued
the
animals
A
district
court
judge
has
given
custody
of
the
animals
to
the
state
of
Maine
pending
an
investigation
Late
last
month
another

court
judge
ruled
that
a
woman
who
killed
a
foster
child
in
her
care
can
retain
parental
rights
of
her
four-year-old
son
The
woman
Sally
Ann
Schofield
duct-taped
five
year
old
Logan
Marr
to
a
high
chair
in
the
basement
Schofield
taped
Marr's
mouth
asphyxiating
the
child
One
can
only
imagine
the
fear
and
the
pain
that
toddler
suffered
in
her
last
few
hours
of
life
Alone
in
the
dark
unable
to
breathe
or
move
The
woman
that
tortured
and
killed
Marr
is
in
prison
now
for
manslaugter
but
a
judge
deems
her
fit
for
motherhood
In
Maine
the
state
will
take
custody
of
animals
who
are
mistreated
but
will
allow
convicted
child-killers
to
retain
parental
rights
Animal
abuse
is
terrible
and
should
be
treated
with
seriousness
It's
wonderful
that
the
state
was
able
to
move
in
quickly
and
save
the
animals
in
Pembroke
that
were
living
in
unfit
conditions
It's
tragic
that
the
state
didn't
move
in
to
save
Logan
Marr
when
it
had
the
chance
Despite
evidence
that
Schofield
was
abusing
Marr
DHS
never
took
action
In
fact
DHS
discouraged
Marr's
mother
from
pursuing
the
abuse
allegations
One
week
after
abuse
allegations
were
made
against
an
animal
control
officer
the
animals
were
removed
from
their
environment
One
month
after
abuse
allegations
were
made
against
a
foster
mother
a
child
died
in
that
mother's
care
and
now
that
woman
has
been
allowed
to

portray

Kerry's
refusal
to

raises
an

is
there
something
in

that
contradicts

The
Soft
Bigotry
of
a
Sometimes
Conservative
Andrew
Sullivan
is
surprised
at
a
recent
poll
showing
a
lack
of
evangelical
support
for
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
52
percent
of
evangelicals
said
they
preferred
the
matter
to
be
handled
by
the
states
So
they
are
conservatives
after
all
Moreover
48
percent
of
evangelicals
said
that
support
for
marriage
rights
for
gays
would
not
disqualify
a
candidate
from
their
voteSullivan's
snark
is
merely
a
halfhearted
attempt
to
disguise
the
fact
that
he
has
no
idea
what
evangelicals
really
believe
His
former
posts
on
the
subject
of
evangelicals
and
their
support
for
President
Bush
showed
an
appalling
lack
of
information
about
the
group
of
which
I
consider
myself
a
member
Like
so
many
in
Washington
Sullivan
was
looking
to
the
leaders
of
groups
that
claim
to
represent
evangelicals
instead
of
at
the
actual
beliefs
of
those
he
was
so
quick
to
stereotype
as
dim-witted
theocrats
President
Bush
may
not
convince
those
of
us
who
oppose
the
FMA
to
support
him
on
this
issue
but
we
are
not
going
to
let
this
affect
our
vote
Unlike
Sullivan
who
has
let
his
disagreement
with
the
president
on
this
issue
cloud
his
judgment
on
the
administration
most
evangelicals
are
not
one-issue
voters
I
intend
to
vote
for
President
Bush
despite
his
support
for
the
FMA
because
I
agree
with
him
on
taxes
the
war
on
terror
and
abortion
Most
evangelicals
I
know
intend
to
vote
for
the
president
for
a
number
of
the
same
reasons
Many
moderates
I'm
sure
are
in
agreement
with
us
on
this
one
Sullivan
is
a
smart
man
but
cannot
seem
to
grasp
that
most
Americans
moderates
and
Democrats
included
do
not
support
gay
marriage
The
attention
to
the
issue
has
not
come
as
a
result
of
a
grassroots
effort
made
up
of
a
diverse
coalition
but
from
the
impulsive
actions
taken
by
a
few
thousand
activists
in
mostly
liberal
areas
of
the
country
Given
his
situation
I
can
understand
his
hope
But
hope
wishes
and
judicial
activism
will
not
be
enough
to
sway
those
who
do
not
agree
that
a
long-standing
social
institution
should
be
changed
Sullivan's
evangelical
bashing
is
getting
tiresome
After
complaining
so
long
about
bias
against
gays
and
lesbians
one
would
think
he
would
be
more
careful
about
allowing
himself
to
feel
and
condone
prejudice

As
California
Goes
John
Fund
of
OpinionJournal.com
says
California
Governor
Arnold
Schwarzenegger
has
started
talking
about
making
the
California
legislature
part-time
Although
there
are
risks
associated
with
this
action
the
idea
of
taking
politicians
out
of
the
capitol
and
putting
them
into
the
real
world
for
a
time
could
help
public
policy
in
the
long
run
Perhaps
it's
an
idea
that
would
help
politicians
in
Washington
D.C
Depending
on
my
mood
I
either
chuckle
or
throw
something
at
the
television
when
I
hear
John
Kerry
talking
about
Bush's
tax
cuts
only
benefitting
the
rich
My
wife
and
I
are
not
rich
but
we
did
save
money
on
taxes
last
year
Overall
we
saved
about
1300
That
may
not
seem
like
a
lot
to
a
Senator
who
owns
five
houses
and
a
yacht
but
to
those
of
us
in
the
real
world
an
extra
hundred
or
so
per
month
helps
out
quite
a
bit
sometimes
John
Kerry
has
forgotten
what
it
feels
like
to
be
middle-class
if
he
ever
knew
at
all
What's
more
bothersome
about
his
rhetoric
on
taxing
the
rich
is
how
eagerly
the
crowds
he's
addressing
cheer
for
those
words
They
don't
seem
to
realize
simple
economics
those
with
wealth
create
jobs
Take
away
some
of
that
wealth
and
it
will
mean
lost
jobs
These
are
the
same
people
who
decry
outsourcing
as
un-American
These
companies
aren't
employing
foreigners
because
they
hate
Americans
they
employ
foreign
labor
because
it's
gotten
too
expensive
to
do
business
in
the
United
States
in
some
sectors
of
the
economy
John
Kerry
wants
to
make
it
more
expensive
If
Kerry
were
willing
to
leave
his
lofty
post
in
the
Senate
and
talk
to
those
working
for
a
living
and
struggling
under
the
weight
of
excessive
taxation
instead
of
simply
addressing
crowds
of
mindless
partisans
he
would
see
why
some
Americans
are
struggling
In
many
cases
it's
not
because
the
government
is
not
doing
enough
It's
because
the
feds
are

too
much

Heath
Returns
Here's
a
story
I
missed
commenting
on
while
the
site
was
down
Michael
Heath
has
returned
to
work
after
being
grounded
by
the
Maine
Christian
Civic
League's
Board
of
Directors
If
his
comments
in
the
news
story
are
any
indication
of
his
mindset
then
he's
learned
nothing
I
need
to
learn
to
count
to
10
especially
after
a
success
like
the
marriage
rally
I
need
to
be
careful
not
to
become
headstrong
and
push
too
hard
and
come
up
with
ideas
that
ought
not
to
be
ideas
at
all."Recently
I
read
the
book
In
But
Not
Of
A
Guide
to
Christian
Ambition
and
the
Desire
to
Influence
the
World
by
Hugh
Hewitt
It's
a
book
I
wish
had
been
written
ten
years
ago
the
advice
in
it
for
believers
who
want
to
make
a
difference
in
their
world
is
both
wise
and
realistic
something
not
always
true
of
Christian
books
In
the
book
Hewitt
encourages
believers
to
mark
and
continually
review
the
limits
you
will
not
trespass
This
is
not
something
Heath
has
done
and
it
has
hurt
both
his
witness
and
his
effectiveness
Some
of
the
damage
Heath
did
to
himself
and
the
Christian
Civic
League
may
be
irreparable
His
relationships
with
legislators
may
never
fully
heal
all
because
he
never
told
himself
one
simple
word
wait
Heath
has
set
the
most
dangerous
of
constraints
for
his
ideas
what
will
work
and
not
offend
instead
of
what
is
right
Heath
has
also
not
realized
the
importance
of
accountability
of
the
need
for
a
strong
relationship
with
another
believer
who
can
preview
his
communications
with
the
outside
world
and
act
as
a
check
on
his
more
impulsive
actions
In
his
statement
to
the
Bangor
Daily
News
Heath
uses
dangerous
phrases
I
need
to
learn...I
need
to
be
careful
No
acknowledgement
of
his
need
for
another
is
present
If
Heath
depends
too
much
on
his
own
ability
to
learn
or
be
careful
he
will
fail
again
Not
because
he's
a
bad
person
but
because
he's
a
person
We
all
become
blind
to
our
own
faults
and
weaknesses
and
that
inclination
can
lead
to
sometimes
serious
problems
Michael
Heath
is
a
good
man
with
honorable
intentions
doing
a
thankless
job
in
an
unforgiving
environment
Asking
him
to
be
faultless
is
not
fair
Asking
him
to
take
steps
so
that
he
is
as
faultless
as
possible
though
should
be
the
responsibility
of
every
Christian
in
Heath's
life

Film
Profits
Last
month
Schindler's
List
was
released
on
DVD
and
I
purchased
a
copy
The
movie
is
hard
to
watch
but
an
excellent
movie
The
media
treated
the
release
of
this
DVD
as
an
event
perhaps
as
a
reaction
to
the
attention
given
the
allegedly
anti-Semitic
The
Passion
of
the
Christ
By
the
time
Schindler's
List
was
in
stores
on
March
9
the
Mel
Gibson
movie
about
Christ
had
made
over
200
million
at
the
box
office
The
Passion
was
made
on
a
budget
of
about
25
million
and
the
enormous
financial
success
of
the
movie
began
to
bother
those
for
whom
large
amounts
of
money
are
obscene
The
media
carping
about
The
Passion
turned
from
its
message
to
its
success
The
media
who
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
a
movie
about
Christ's
sufferings
began
to
use
those
sufferings
in
its
criticism
of
the
movie
Morning
talk
show
hosts
began
to
question
whether
it
was
right
for
Gibson
to
profit
from
a
movie
about
the
suffering
and
death
of
Jesus
Steven
Speilberg
and
Schindler's
List
was
brought
into
the
argument
Speilberg
they
said
was
donating
all
of
the
DVD
profits
from
his
movie
to
the
Shoah
Foundation
Surely
Gibson
didn't
mean
to
keep
that
money
In
his
regular
column
at
The
Ornery
American
Orson
Scott
Card
encourages
Mel
Gibson
to
keep
the
profits
and
use
them
In
an
open
letter
to
Gibson
Card
writes
the
following
It
looks
like
you're
going
to
make
a
profit
on
The
Passion
of
the
Christ
Please
don't
donate
any
part
of
the
profits
to
charity
Instead
use
it
to
finance
other
films
so
this
faithful
audience
can
have
the
visualized
stories
they
hunger
for
Keep
the
standards
high
and
the
audience
will
only
grow
This
will
do
far
more
for
Christianity
and
religious
faith
in

than

Remember
Bulworth
Or
Primary
Colors
How
about
Wag
the
Dog
Or
The
Contender
No
You're
not
alone
They
were
all
films
that
promised
to
shake
up
the
political
establishment
with
their
cynical
view
of
the
political
world
and
in
some
cases
leftist
sentiments
They
all
have
one
thing
in
common
They
flopped
badly
at
the
box
office
Now
Hollywood
is
going
to
make
more
films
with
anti-conservative
or
anti-Bush
messages
One
of
the
films
will
even
be
promoted
through
MoveOn.org
The
films
will
flop
except
for
maybe
the
one
by
Michael

But
that

has
a
built-in
audience
And

will
go
up

ultimately
end
up
paying

the
obsessive
need
of
some
liberals
to
vent
their
political

onto

10
Finding
Nemo
339,714,978This
is
the
list
of
gross
not
adjusted
for
inflation
What
do
all
of
these
films
have
in
common
None
of
them
are
political
None
of
them
tries
to
promote
a
particular
agenda
In
fact
if
you
look
at
the
entire
list
of
all-time
grossing
films
adjusted
for
inflation
and
not
adjusted
you
find
no
films
with
hard
political
or
social
agendas
In
fact
if
these
movies
do
have
a
common
theme
it's
not
liberal
nor
is
it
conservative
these
movies
all
have
universal
themes
good
versus
evil
the
importance
of
family
the
responsibility
of
the
powerful
and
the
need
to
eliminate
planet-destroying
starships
with
your
ragged
band
of
rebels
Look
at
the
adjusted
for
inflation
list
Many
of
those
films
have
subjects
of
Christian
faith
The
Robe
Ben-Hur
The
Ten
Commandments
People
don't
want
to
see
embittered
liberals
grinding
axes
onscreen
They
want
to
see
films
that
entertain
but
also
films
that
reflect
common
values
Fifty
years
from
now
people
will
still
be
watching
The
Passion
of
the
Christ
and
the
Lord
of
the
Rings
films
I
doubt
anyone
will
bother
with
Farenheit
911

Andy
Rooney
In
a
despicable
column
Andy
Rooney
says
the
following
about
members
of
the
US
Military
We
speak
of
them
as
if
they
volunteered
to
risk
their
lives
to
save
ours
but
there
isn't
much
voluntary
about
what
most
of
them
have
done
A
relatively
small
number
are
professional
soldiers
During
the
last
few
years
when
millions
of
jobs
disappeared
many
young
people
desperate
for
some
income
enlisted
in
the
Army
About
40
percent
of
our
soldiers
in
Iraq
enlisted
in
the
National
Guard
or
the
Army
Reserve
to
pick
up
some
extra
money
and
never
thought
they'd
be
called
on
to
fight
They
want
to
come
home.It's
probably
time
for
CBS
to
can
this
rotten
old
crank
and
end
his
whiny
commentary
Rooney
is
probably
right
that
many
soldiers
in
Iraq
don't
want
to
be
there
and
that
many
joined
never
thinking
they
would
have
to
fight
That
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
they
did
volunteer
and
that
they
knew
what
they
were
getting
into
when
they
signed
on
the
dotted
line
What's
worse
about
Rooney's
column
is
his
attempt
to
use
the
suicides
of
troubled
or
depressed
soldiers
serving
in
Iraq
as
a
political
weapon
against
the
Bush
administration
I
guess
if
you
hate
the

badly
enough
anything

hope

Rice

This
morning
Condoleeza
Rice
handled
herself
quite
well
under
some
rather
nasty
questioning
by
partisans
on
the
September
11
commission
I
tried
listening
to
the
testimony
but
have
little
patience
for
grandstanding
questions
One
thing
that
I
think
will
hurt
the
commission
the
applause
Some
in
the
audience
applauded
ben-Veniste
and
Kerrey
after
they
had
either
asked
a
particularly
loaded
question
or
were
rude
to
Rice
The
applause
made
it
sound
as
though
there
were
points
being
scored
on
some
invisible
scoreboard
in
the
minds
of
those
who
want
to
see
the
Bush
administration
blamed
for
the
events
of
September
11
It
makes
the
entire
commission
look
like
a
partisan
effort
to
make
the
president
look
bad
in
an
election
year

Evangelism
This

Easter
Churches
around

country
are
opening
their
doors
to
newcomers
with
special
presentations
on
the
meaning

Unless

It
may
not

gruesome

evangelism

I
was

are
better

ways
Yes
Easter
is
becoming

secularized
The
way
to
fight
that

isn't
to
mock

secularists
and
scare
the

out

It's
to

In

it
is
now
our

to
end
it
And
that

will
not
come
from

nor

to
let
fundamentalists
and
their

alone
but
only
through
the

and

of
their

So
let
us
cease
the
hysterics
make
the
needed
sacrifices
and
allow
our

the
resources
money
and
support
with

it

When

resistance
they
warned

The
Meaning
of
Faith
John
Kerry's
recent
misrepresentation
of
Catholic
doctrine
regarding
the
sanctity
of
human
life
has
started
quite
a
good
internet
discussion
on
the
subject
of
faith
and
politics
Hugh
Hewitt
enters
the
fray
with
a
column
on
Kerry's
catechism
of
convenience
Carson
Holloway
writing
in
National
Review
says
that
Kerry
deserves
rebuke
from
the
church
on
his
recent
statements
This
situation
reinforces
what
I
think
is
Kerry's
most
glaring
weakness
as
a
candidate
and
as
a
politician
his
almost
total
lack
of
personal
conviction
John
Kerry
doesn't
seem
to
believe
in
anything
The
rationale
behind
his
campaign
isn't
that
he
would
be
good
for
America
only
different
Even
his
campaign
slogan
A
New
Direction
for
America
suggests
the
negative
foundation
upon
which
his
campaign
rests
He's
saying
I
don't
have
any
real
ideas
for
America
I
can
promote
but
I'll
be
different
from
the
guy
that
currently
holds
the
office
After
spending
decades
in
elected
office
Senator
Kerry
has
no
record
that
he
can
use
to
help
him
Such
is
the
bitter
fruit
of
political
expediency
So
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
faith
Kerry's
statements
on
his
Catholicism
and
the
freedom
of
conscience
for
Catholics
doctrine
that
he
has
apparently
created
show
that
in
faith
as
in
politics
he
wants
to
have
it
both
ways
Kerry
wants
to
be
seen
as
religious
without
actually
allowing
his
faith
to
impact
his
life
or
opinions
Catholic
doctrine
is
very
clear
on
the
issue
of
abortion
it's
a
mortal
sin
Kerry's
absolute
support
of
abortion
rights
even
to
the
point
of
voting
against
the
ban
on
partial-birth
abortions
goes
against
a
major
moral
teaching
of
the
faith
he
claims
as
his
own
Instead
of
just
saying
that
he
disagrees
with
Catholic
teachings
on
this
point
and
finding
scripture
or
teachings
to
support
his
position
Kerry
invents
a
doctrine
to
make
himself
right
The
senator
has
something
of
a
boundaries
problem
here
in
Congress
he's
allowed
to
write
the
laws
In
religion
we're
expected
to
obey
them
even
if
that
means
giving
up
a
personal
belief
or
opinion
John
Kerry
wants
an
easy
faith
It
seems
he
wants
to
go
to
church
take
communion
and
most
importantly
be
seen
as
a
religious
person
If
that's
the
case
though
he's
picked
the
wrong
religion
Christ
didn't
advocate
the
easy
path
in
fact
He
spoke
against
it
Christian
writer
C.S
Lewis
once
wrote
the
following
I
didn't
go
to
religion
to
make
me
happy
I
always
knew
a
bottle
of
port
would
do
that
If
you
want
a
religion
to
make
you
feel
really
comfortable
I
certainly
don't
recommend
Christianity
G.K
Chesterson
said
lf
the
Church
marries
the
spirit
of
the
age
she
will
soon
become
a
widow.It's
time
for
Kerry
to
realize
that
religion
doesn't
exist
to
make
him
happy
or
comfortable
or
to
provide
him
with
excellent
opportunities
to
impress
other
people
The
church
also
shouldn't
sway
with
what
society
or
a
particular
politician
believes
In
short
Kerry
can't
parse
faith
or
take
both
sides
of
this
particular
issue
That
may
work
in
the
Senate
but
I
wouldn't
recommend
such
an
approach
with
God

Weird
Campaign
The
Democrat
primary
election
is
over
right
So
why
is
the
Kerry
campaign
using
Ted
Kennedy
to
appeal
to
voters
by
challenging
Bush's
credibility
There
are
many
other
Democrats
without
Kennedy's
baggage
that
the
Kerry
campaign
could
have
used
to
make
the
case
Using
Kennedy
shows
a
myopic
vision
within
the
campaign
everyone
they
know
loves
Ted
Kennedy
so
of
course
he
should
be
used
for
a
major
attack
speech
After
all
he's
the
conscience
of
the

right
After

painting
himself
as
a

does
John
Kerry
really
want
to
lash
his
political
campaign

Kerry's
Catholicism
Andrew
Sullivan
is
accusing
Kathryn
Jean
Lopez
and
her
fellow
theocrats
of
wanting
to
excommunicate
John
Kerry
from
the
Catholic
church
First
of
all
Sullivan's
blog
is
quickly
degenerating
from
must-read
to
if
I
have
the
time
Lately
he's
substituted
his
normally
sane
and
insightful
commentary
with
name-calling
and
the
hyping
of
every
negative
story
about
Bush
he
can
find
on
the
web
I
know
these
complaints
about
Sullivan's
site
have
been
a
staple
of
this
site
for
a
couple
of
weeks
now
but
it's
truly
rooted
in
my
extreme
disappointment
with
his
blog
lately
Over
the
past
few
months
since
the
president
announced
his
support
for
the
FMA
Sullivan
has
gotten
more
and
more
negative
in
tone
Not
just
about
Bush
but
about
the
world
in
general
It's
become
a
downer
to
read
Now
onto
the
subject
at
hand
Sullivan
and
others
are
angry
that
a
bishop
in
the
Catholic
church
recently
asked
parish
priests
to
stop
serving
communion
to
politicians
who
hold
positions
contrary
to
Catholic
doctrine
Why
are
they
angry
Are
they
suggesting
that
the
state
should
come
in
and
force
the
Catholic
church
to
make
receipt
of
a
divine
sacrament
mandatory
I
do
not
know
the
state
of
John
Kerry's
heart
or
the
honesty
of
his
faith
That's
something
between
only
he
and
God
know
What
I
do
know
though
is
that
Kerry
has
advocated
public
policy
that
is
in
direct
conflict
with
Christian
doctrine
the
most
serious
being
his
support
of
abortion
Catholics
believe
that
to
have
or
participate
in
an
abortion
is
a
mortal
sin
requiring
penance
Because
Kerry's
unfailing
support
for
abortion
has
doubtless
made
it
possible
for
many
women
to
have
abortions
or
participate
in
the
procedure
many
Catholic
leaders
believe
he
has
broken
faith
with
Catholic
doctrine
The
Catholic
church
requires
that
those
who
receive
communion
be
in
a
state
of
grace
Kerry's
unapologetic
support
for
abortion
puts
him
out
of
this
state
as
he
has
shown
no
penance
for
supporting
a
mortal
sin
Therefore
the
leadership
has
concluded
he
is
unfit
to
enter
a
state
where
he
can
receive
communion
in
good
faith
The
Catholic
church
should
be
commended
for
its
strong
stance
on
this
issue
It
reminds
believers
that
communion
is
more
than
just
a
ritual
it's
not
something
to
be
taken
lightly
The
church
is
under
no
obligation
to
serve
communion
to
those
whom
it
believes
do
not
take
their
faith
seriously
enough
to
follow
its
commandments
to
protect
the
innocent
The
anger
of
Sullivan
and
others
is
misplaced
And
yes
if
Kerry
were
a
Republican
I
would
believe
the
same
thing
This
isn't
about
mere
partisanship
there's
much
more
than
politics
at
stake
here

The
Not-So-Glorious
End
Carl
Olson
writing
in
National
Review
online
critiques
the
final
book
in
the
Left
Behind
series
I
got
through
five
or
six
books
in
the
series
before
finally
giving
up
Although
the
authors
have
a
compelling
story
to
tell
they
don't
seem
to
have
any
idea
how
to
do
it
The
books
are
dull
with
wooden
characters
and
awful
dialogue
Olson
includes
a
great
quote
from
Flannery
O'Connor
Ever
since
there
have
been
such
things
as
novels
the
world
has
been
flooded
with
bad
fiction
for
which
the
religious
impulse
has
been
responsible
The
sorry
religious
novel
comes
about
when
the
writer
supposed
that
because
of
his
belief
he
is
somehow
dispensed
from
the
obligation
to
penetrate
concrete
reality
He
will
think
that
the
eyes
of
the
Church
or
of
the
Bible
or
of
his
particular
theology
have
already
done
the
seeing
for
him
and
that
his
business
is
to
rearrange
this
essential
vision
into
satisfying
patterns
getting
himself
as
little
dirty
in
the
process
as
possible.The
main
problem
with
the
series
is
that
LaHaye
and
Jenkins
are
more
interested
in
communicating
their
theology
than
telling
a
good
story
Character
development
pacing
and
dialogue
are
all
sacrificed
to
the
larger
goal
of
using
the
books
to
proselytize
A
worthy
goal
but
imagine
how
many
more
people
would
have
read
the
books
if
they
had
been
less
focused
on
what
happens
in
the
end
times
and
more
interested
in
telling
a
well-written
story
about
the
people

Brendan

says
such

was
unneccessary
Instead
Mr
Clarke
should
apologize
for
his
error-ridden
screed
against
President
Bush
The

attention
to
the
claims
of
Clarke
were
fine

way
the

Clarke

that
the

did
more

than

Clarke's
willingness
to
let
Clinton
almost
completely
off
the
hook
for
that

almost
total
failure

curb

it's

Peggy
Noonan
is
angry
about
the
events
in
Fallujah
yesterday
Her
advice
seems
right
to
me
What
happened
yesterday
was
an
attempt
to
get
the
United
States
to
cut
and
run
from
Iraq
the
way
we
did
from
Somalia
Fallujah
has
been
a
trouble
spot
in
Iraq
since
the
war
ended
So
the
American
military
should
now
lock
it
down
No
one
comes
no
one
goes
until
the
young
men
responsible
for
the
deaths
and
mutilations
of
the
American
contractors
and
the
constant
terrorist
attacks
in
that
city
are
caught
As
we
saw
throughout
the
1990s
barbarism
allowed
to
go
unchecked
will
result
in
further
barbarism
For
decades
Iraqis
lived
with
the
message
that
savagery
works
it
helps
keep
the
peace
and
keep
leadership
in
power
It's
no

that
some
continue
to
use
it
as
a
weapon
against
those
who
are
trying
to
change
the
political
and
social
order
It's
time
for
the
provisional
Iraqi
government
and
the
Iraqi
police
to
show
a
proper
response
to
such
savagery
Noonan's

the

I'm

think
there's
a

of
poetry
in

There's
a
lot

a
lot

in

And
I

you'd
better
listen
to
it
pretty
carefully
cause
it's
important.Is
there
anything
more
pathetic
than
a
middle-aged
rich
elitist
trying
to
identify
with

crowd
by
making
statements
like
this
There's
nothing
important
about

there
was
something
important
about

alt
rock

music

Which
songs

Kerry
find

put
it

funny
stuff
Compare
that
to
some
past
Garafalo
quotes
that
are
all
sweetness
and
light
The
Republican
Party
their
message
and
their
policies
of
exclusion
and
the
tilted
playing
field
appeals
to
the
dumb
and
the
mean
There
is
no
shortage
of
dumb
and
mean
people
in
this
culture
So
therefore
their
message
the
dumb
and
the
mean
find
a
nice
home
in
the
GOP...What
you
have
now
is
people
that
are
closet
racists
misogamists
homophobes
and
people
who
love
tilted
playing
fields
and
the
politics
of
exclusion
identifying
as
conservative...Such...nuance
Then
there's
this
one
And
if
I
am
uninformed
which
I'd
like
to
think
I
work
very
hard
not
to
be
uninformed
it
is
the
fault
of
the
White
House
and
the
mainstream
mediaBrilliant
Now
these
people
are
blaming
Bush
for
their
own
stupidity
I
love
America

Maine
Governor
John
Baldacci
has
been
working
to
secure
a
buyer
for
Eastern
Fine
Paper
mills
in
Lincoln
and
Brewer
He
has
spent
state
money
to
keep
the
mills
viable
for
purchase
Over
750
jobs
would
be
lost
if
the
negotiations
had
not
happened
In
my
humble
opinion
the
state
is
working
too
hard
to
prop
up
a
dying
industry
But
one
cannot
deny
that
the
work
Governor
Baldacci
has
done
may
keep
people
working
Cannot
deny
that
is
unless
you're
a
union
boss
Steve
Corriveau
president
of
a
Lincoln
union
is
quoted
in
the
story
We've
been
totally
left
out
of
the
loop
I
do
not
want
to
say
I'm
cautiously
optimistic
because
optimistic
means
there's
something
positive
I
do
realize
the
governor
is
doing
everything
he
can
to
secure
a
buyer
here
but
I
am
very
concerned
about
what
I'm
not
hearing
here.In
effect
Corriveau
seems
to
be
saying
that
the
state's
work
and
the
spending
of
my
tax
dollars
so
he
can
keep
his
job
is
not
a
positive
thing
It's
true
that
these
guys
may
not
get
paid
quite
as
much
as
before
or
get
all
the
benefits
to
which
they
were
accustomed
But
they
would
go
from
not
working
to
working
They
would
draw
a
paycheck
again
at
a
job
they
know
instead
of
spending
years
back
in
school
or
job
retraining
programs
The
deal
has
not
been
finalized
Either
side
can
walk
away
If
you
were
the
buyer
and
you
read
this
quote
wouldn't
it
give
you
an
idea
of
the
types
of
union
members
you
would
have
to
deal
with
Corriveau
in
a
single
quote
has
seemed
both
ungrateful
and
impossible
to
please
Neither
are
particulary
attractive
qualities
in
a
workforce

Wednesday
I
think
our
gas
station
owners
are
tired
of
being
yelled
at
about
high
gas
prices
The
price
of
gas
has
risen
here
in
Maine
to
about
1.75
a
gallon
On
each
pump
though
the
owners
have
put
a
sticker
breaking
down
the
price
of
gasoline
It
seems
we
pay
only
1.31
per
gallon
of
gas
the
rest
of
the
cost
is
taxes
John
Kerry
has
been
trying
to
blame
the
high
gas
prices
on
George
W
Bush
Let's
look
at
a
few
facts
though
John
Kerry
voted
against
increasing
U.S
energy
independence
by
voting
against
drilling
in
Alaska
Not
once
but
seven
times
Kerry
has
proposed
tax
hikes
on
gasoline
that
would
increase
gas
taxes
another
50
cents
per
gallon
The
George
W
Bush
re-election
website
includes
a
gas
tax
calculator
that
helps
you
figure
out
how
much
more
you'll
be
paying
for
gasoline
under
Kerry
Yes
gas
prices
are
high
But
instead
of
ranting
about
wars
for
oil
and
a
Halliburton-funded
conspiracy
involving
Bush
Cheney
and
the
Illuminati
and
their
plan
to
take
over
the
world
how
about
dealing
with
the
fact
that
state
governments
and
the
federal
government
in
the
United
States
have
grown
too
dependent
upon
various
unseen
taxes
we
pay
all
the
time
Bush
has
lowered
some
of
those
taxes
and
hopes
to
do
so
again
Kerry
would
raise
them
This
fall
support
George
W
Bush
with
your
donations
or
your
time

Eastern
Paper
If
the
latest
attempt
at
a
deal
to
keep
Eastern
Paper
doesn't
work
Governor
Baldacci
should
give
it
up
The
state
has
already
exhausted
its
contingency
funds
to
maintain
the
property
and
will
soon
begin
borrowing
funds
from
bond
issue
accounts
I
understand
that
the
closing
of
the
Lincoln
and
Brewer
mills
would
be
hard
on
the
economy
and
tax
bases
of
both
towns
but
eventually
one
has
to
admit
defeat
on
the
issue
and
stop
throwing
good
money
at
a
dying
industry
Instead
of
spending
money
to
keep
dying
industries
alive
Baldacci
should
be
focusing
the
state
on
how
it
can
change
its
business
practices
to
attract
new
industry
Maybe
it
would
mean
lowering
taxes
fixing
worker's
compensation
and
getting
rid
of
unnecessary
regulation
In
the
short
term
the
state
may
lose
some
tax
money
Some
entitlement
programs
may
need
to
be
curtailed
But
considering
it's
short-term
thinking
that
got
us
in
this
mess
in
the
first
place
an
approach
that
looks
past
immediate
needs
may
be
the
answer

David
Frum
rips
into
Richard
Clarke
on
National
Review
Online
This
administration
came
into
office
to
discover
that
al
Qaeda
had
been
allowed
to
grow
into
a
full-blown
menace
It
lost
six
precious
weeks
to
the
Florida
recount
and
then
weeks
after
Inauguration
Day
to
the
go-slow
confirmation
procedures
of
a
50-50
Senate
As
late
as
the
summer
of
2001
pitifully
few
of
Bush's
own
people
had
taken
their
jobs
at
State
Defense
and
the
NSC
Then
it
was
hit
by
9/11
And
now
now
the
same
people
who
allowed
al
Qaeda
to
grow
up
who
delayed
the
staffing
of
the
administration
who
did
nothing
when
it
was
their
turn
to
act
who
said
nothing
when
they
could
have
spoken
in
advance
of
the
attack
these
same
people
accuse
George
Bush
of
doing
too
little
There's
a
long
answer
to
give
folks
like
that
and
also
a
short
one
And
the
short
one
is
How
dare
you?Sounds
about
right
to
me
