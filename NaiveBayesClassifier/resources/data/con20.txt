Democrats
are
already
crowing
about
the
huge
early
voter
turnout
in
Florida
Democrats
are
beaming
that
their
party
is
outperforming
the
Republicans
in
early
voting
releasing
numbers
Wednesday
that
show
registrants
of
their
party
ahead
54
percent
to
30
percent
among
the
1.4
million
voters
who
have
gone
to
the
polls
early
But
before
they
started
breaking
out
the
champagne
perhaps
they
should
have
taken
a
look
at
whom
those
Democrats
voted
for
A
Los
Angeles
Times/Bloomberg
poll
gave
McCain
a
49-45
lead
over
Democrat
Barack
Obama
among
Floridians
who
have
already
voted
So
in
spite
of
outnumbering
Republicans
almost
2
to
1
they
still
come
out
4
points
behind
Well
that
certainly
IS
awesome
news
Unless
you
happen
to
be
named

So
how
is
this
those

don't

they'll

11:57
AM
I'm
sure
you've
all
already
heard
about
the
alleged
API
tape
recording
of
Michelle
Obambi
making
racist
comments
I
haven't
written
a
word
about
it
because
I
really
don't
know
what
to
think
of
it
Besides
I'm
much
more
interested
in
the
video
tape
of
the
Obambis
attending
a
pro-paleosimian
anti-semitic
hate
fest
that
the
LA
Times
possesses
but
for
some
mysterious
reason
refuses
to
release
But
I
have
to
admit
that
I'm
intrigued
by
that
API
tape
and
what
it
might
contain
Word
on
the
street
was
that
API
had
a
deal
with
FOX
News
to
air
it
and
now
I'm
told
that
ObaMarx's
campaign
manager
contacted
API
offering
them
3,000,000
in
return
for
not
airing
it
before
the
election
Sounds
like
attempted
bribery
to
me
It
also
sounds
like
whatever
might
be
on
that
tape
is
kinda
juicy
I
mean
I
don't
see
ObaMarx
offering
to
throw
three
cool
mils
at
somebody
just
to
keep
people
from
hearing
his
wife
say
fuck
on
the
air
Particularly
not
when
he
being
as
flush
with
foreign
cash
as
he
is
at
the
moment
can't
find
it
in
himself
to
throw
a
few
shekels
at
his
own
half-brother
or
for
that
matter
his
beloved
aunt
both
of
whom
live
in
abject
squalor
and
poverty
It
could
still
all
be
bullshit
but
API
is
said
to
be
lawyering
up
and
sending
their
legal
eagle
off
to
the
U.S
embassy
in
Oslo
to
report
the
bribery
attempt
Could
be
Interesting
No
matter
what
it's
about
time
for
somebody
to
either
put
up
or
shut
up
It
can't
be
all
that
fucking
hard
to
put
a
tape
on
the
air
if
it
actually
exists

here's

that's

h/t
LC
IB
Ace
Particularly
interesting
is
the
shift
on
the
economy
where
the
Obamessiah
not
too
long
ago
led
by
9
points
Still
think
it's
an
Obambi
landslide
We
pass
the
word
to
the
PUMAs
at
Hillbuzz
who
unlike
most
of
us
actually
have
contacts
deep
within
the
ObaMarx's
campaign
and
who
are
therefore
in
a
unique
position
to
deliver
actual
information
as
opposed
to
the
24/7
avalanche
of
propaganda
BS
thrown
in
our
faces
by
the
Obamamedia
According
to
their
contacts
within
the
campaign
Ohio
New
Hampshire
and
even
Maine
look
to
be
victories
for
McCain/Palin
and
Obambi's
staffers
are
freaking
out
over
it
But
but
but
The
MSM
say
otherwise
Since
when
did
Rotties
start
taking
anything
the
MSM
said
seriously
Apparently
only
when
it's
bad
news
Could
the
PUMAs
sources
be
wrong
Anybody
could
be
but
if
I
have
to
choose
between
people
in
the
know
reporting
from
the
inside
and
the
Obamamedia
Well
that's
pretty
much
a
no-brainer
isn't
it
It
also
correlates
nicely
with
the
increasingly
panic-stricken
emails
that
I
get
flooded
with
from
the
Obambi
campaign
and
MorOn.org
And
ALSO
also
I
don't
think
that
the
PUMAs
would
be
investing
their
meager
funds
and
time
in
aggressively
busing
in
canvassers
for
McCain/Palin
if
they
thought
it
was
a
lost
race
Speaking
of
which
I
look
at
the
rampant
Eeyoreism
on
the
right
and
then
I
look
at
the
initiative
gumption
optimism
and
fighting
spirit
among
the
PUMAs
and
I
am
quite
frankly
a
bit
embarrassed
We'll

Yeah
it's
an
Iowahawk
post
so
you
know
it's
going
to
be
funnier
than
a
three-legged
dog
tryin
to
piss
on
a
tree
But
as
you'll
see
in
this
post
Professor
Iowahawk
takes
the
subject
of
statistics
and
shows
you
just
how
fun
it
can
be
How
fun
can
statistics
be
you
may
be
asking
yourself
And
that's
a
very
good
question
Here's

Any

ends
with

Until

I
felt
some
humor
would
be
appropriate
right
about
now
considering
that
after
a
day
full
of
worrying
and
praying
for
the
Boss
I
came
home
and
saw
a
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
for
him
So
anyhooo
Blackfive's
Uber

has
an
excellent
series
called
Ask

where
he
takes
a
Dear

letter
and
turns
it
over
to
the
grunts
for
a

advice
The
results
are
hillarious

Well

In

I
hasten
to
add
You
people
are
bloody
AWESOME
and
I
am
completely
speechless
here
Which
isn't
something
particularly
characteristic
for
me
to
put
it
mildly
I
can't
thank
you
enough
for
the
outpouring
of
support
tips
and
leads
but
rest
assured
that
I'll
be
very
busy
doing
my
best
trying
to
anyway
That's
the
very
least
I
can
do
in

Thanks
again
from
the

I'll

thanks

Sorry
for
being
such
a
pissant
but
sometimes
you
reach
the
point
where
you
just
need
a
break
I
believe
I've
found
mine
I'll
be
back
I
may
bend
but
never
break
but
right
now
I
just
can't
take
any
more
of
this
Book
of
Job
bullshit
Pardon
me
G-d
I'm
not
denouncing
You
nor
has
my
faith
in
You
lessened
I
just
need
a
break
You
don't
owe
me
anything
if
anyone
is
in
debt
here
it's
me
because
I
haven't
always
been
the
best
child
of
Yours
to
put
it
very
mildly
but
I'm
really
in
need
of
a
breather
here
I
know
I
was
tempting
fate
when
I
noted
that
the
clutch
of
my
crappy
old
car
was
dying
but
still
working
but
I
didn't
expect
it
to
crap
out
on
me
entirely
a
few
hours
later
It's
not
that
I
mind
walking
my
kids
to
school
Heaven
knows
that
it's
not
exactly
an
immense
tribulation
compared
to
the
other
things
that
people
have
gone
through
but
it
does
rather
limit
my
ability
to
go
interview
for
jobs
And
no
I
can
neither
afford
to
have
it
fixed
nor
can
I
afford
to
buy
another
car
Not
that
I'm
getting
a
whole
lot
of
replies
to
my
applications
so
maybe
my
despair
at
not
being
able
to
go
see
employers
is
ridiculous
because
apparently
my
credentials
are
either
worthless
because
they
were
accumulated
in
a
country
where
applicants
for
higher
education
are
actually
required
to
be
able
to
read
and
be
conversant
in
at
least
two
different
languages
not
to
mention
that
ridiculous
requirement
of
knowing
your
classics
and
the
history
of
the
continent
on
which
you
live
as
opposed
to
here
where
anybody
with
vital
signs
can
get
an
embossed
gilded
diploma
from
one
of
our
numerous
diploma
mills
OR
they're
relevant
enough
to
deem
me
overqualified
for
any
position
that
I
apply
for
I've
fucking
well
had
it
I
don't
give
a
shit
what
anybody
asks
me
to
do
if
they'll
pay
me
to
do
it
I'll
do
it
I
have
the
supreme
priority
or
directive
of
having
a
family
to
take
care
of
but
apparently
that's
not
good
enough
Because
I'm
not
a
native
I
was
born
in
a
country
where
you
actually
had
to
have
a
brain
to
get
a
diploma
Not
to
say
that
anybody
with
a
diploma
here
doesn't
have
one
but
from
having
to
read
the
barely
literate
drivel
from
some
of
them
I
can
surely
say
with
confidence
that
a
lot
of
the
bachelors
and
masters
weren't
overburdened
by
an
abundance
of
scholarly
knowledge
Or
basic
intellect
for
that
matter
But
who
cares
I'm
just
another
bitter
gun-clinging
moron
in
dire
need
of
a
break
from
this
whole
load
of
barely
literate
nonsense
and
I'm
about
to
take
one
right
now
I'll
be
back
Maybe
It's
not
like
it
fucking
well
matters
anyway
And
maybe
it
shouldn't
But
for
now
I'm
on
strike
I
don't
expect
it
to
make
a
heck
of
a
difference
it's
not
like
I'm
going
to
Change
The
World
but
I've
just
Had
It
Goodnight
and
good
luck
Thatisall
Update
OK
gang
y'all
know
what
we
need
to
do
G-d
knows
he's
done
it
for
me
Give
till
it
hurts
then
check
the
cushions
for
change
Maybe
skip
a
pack
of
cigaretters
or
the
6-pack
of
brewskis
We
CAN
do
it
Meanwhile
we've
made
contact
with
the
rest
of
the
family
in
the
DFW
area
and
have
some
of
the
best
networking
going
to
locate
someone
that
can
help
the
Boss
and
find
him
some
employment
Appropriate
imprecations
to
the
deity
of
your
choice
are
also
in
order
I'll
be
on
the
horn
with
the
Boss
later
after
the
show
and
I
don't
expect
him
to
even
want
to
think
hard
enough
to
pull
off
his
slot
tonight
and
he
better
pick

A
Short
Personal
Interlude
Posted
by
Emperor
Misha
I
in
Imperial
Thoughts
Life
in
the
Empire
1:28
PM
I
don't
often
talk
about
the
family
This
is
only
because
I'm
a
private
kind
of
person
and
I
suppose
a
bit
paranoid
about
letting
it
all
hang
out
on
the
Internet
particularly
these
days
when
passing
brownshirts
might
catch
on
and
decide
to
demonstrate
their
tolerance
and
Hope
and
Change
by
destroying
my
life
like
they
have
tried
to
destroy
people
like
Joe
the
Plumber
Which
is
sad
because
I
love
to
talk
about
my
family
I
love
them
more
than
life
and
I
am
so
very
very
proud
of
them
One
such
time
when
my
heart
skipped
a
beat
and
I
choked
up
about
how
blessed
I
am
was
recently
My
Heirs
have
been
going
through
election
stuff
in
1st
grade
because
well
we
have
an
election
coming
up
which
makes
it
sort
of
relevant
All
that
stuff
about
how
elections
work
and
how
your
right
to
vote
is
very
very
important
and
how
you
need
to
exercise
it
no
matter
what
I
appreciate
that
We've
already
taught
them
that
but
I
don't
mind
the
reinforcement
one
little
bit
So
anyway
the
oldest
Heir
by
all
of
two
minutes
is
sitting
there
with
me
asking
me
about
the
candidates
in
this
election
and
somehow
the
conversation
drifts
to
whether
they
have
families
too
He
asks
me
whether
the
Obamessiah
has
any
siblings
and
I
answer
truthfully
that
I
only
know
about
a
half-brother
living
in
Africa
on
a
dollar
a
month
relying
on
the
kindnesses
of
strangers
to
get
by
Doesn't
Obama
have
money
he
asks
me
Sure
I
say
more
than
we'll
probably
ever
have
Why
doesn't
he
give
some
of
it
to
his
brother
then
I
don't
know
I
guess
he
doesn't
want
to
The
Heir
thinks
about
that
for
a
moment
and
then
says
Well
dad
when
I
grow
up
and
make
a
lot
of
money
if
I
make
a
thousand
dollars
I
could
send
them
to
his
brother
so
he
could
have
a
house
and
some
food
to
eat
See
That's
redistributing
wealth
done
the
right
way
Not
at
the
point
of
a
gun
but
because
my
kid
thought
that
he
wanted
to
help
this
guy
that
he
didn't
even
know
Yeah
I
choked
up
alright
Great
kid
Here
we
are
stuck
in
shit
so
far
it's
creeping
into
our
nostrils
yet
he
still
has
the
heart
to
feel
for
a
complete
stranger
A
complete
stranger
whose
own
brother
doesn't
give
a
shit
I
might
add
Hearts
of
pure
gold
both
of
them
If
there's
anything
that
I
might
have
had
a
hand
in
teaching
them
that
I
feel
proud
of
that
would
be
it
Like
the
other
day
when
I
was
driving
them
to
school
and
the
old
clunker
with
its
broken
clutch
that
I
can't
afford
to
repair
was
giving
me
the
usual
trouble
while
I
was
trying
to
match
the
revs
and
get
it
in
gear
anyway
and
they
both
offered
to
break
their
piggy
banks
they've
been
saving
up
in
so
I
could
buy
a
new
one
Never
mind
that
their
combined
savings
wouldn't
do
a
bit
of
good
and
that
they'd
been
saving
up
for
stuff
they
desperately
want
for
themselves
they
just
wanted
to
help
out
old
daddy
I
love
them
I
love
them
so
much
OK
the
room
is
getting
dusty
so
I'll
sign
off

The

1:00
PM
The
Imperial
Firearms
Advisor
encounters
yet
another
example
of
idiots
in
this
case
idiots
who
ought
to
know
better
using
the
old
canard
it's
not
really
socialism
unless
the
government
takes
over
everything
We're
used
to
hearing
this
dodge
coming
from
socialists
who
are
trying
to
hide
the
fact
that
they're
socialists
but
we're
really
disappointed
to
hear
that
particular
bit
of
idiocy
coming
from
people
like
Krauthammer
and
Barnes
As
the
Imperial
Firearms
Advisor
correctly
points
out
it's
not
how
you
redistribute
wealth
that
defines
socialism
it's
the
fact
that
you
do
it
at
all
If
you
take
the
money
that
somebody
earns
and
gives
it
to
somebody
who
didn't
then
you're
a
socialist
or
as
a
minimum
that
particular
act
is
a
socialist
act
Period
Full
stop
End
of
discussion
If
you
endorse
it
as
a
generally
good
idea
to
run
a
society
then
you
ARE
a
socialist
Again
End
of
discussion
The
reason
I'm
bringing
this
up
apart
from
my
dismay
at
seeing
two
people
whom
I
thought
were
endowed
with
brains
spouting
nonsense
is
that
it's
used
so
much
by
lefties
and
I'm
getting
sick
and
tired
of
the
hair-splitting
And
I'm
going
to
be
a
bit
long-winded
here
since
it's
a
subject
that
I've
spent
a
lot
of
time
studying
so
I'm
sticking
the
rest
beneath
the
fold
You
might
want
to
read
through
it
anyway
though
because
it's
a
quite
important
point
if
I
do
say
so
myself
But
I'll
leave
you
with
the
option
to
skip
it
Free
choice
baby
Give
us
more
