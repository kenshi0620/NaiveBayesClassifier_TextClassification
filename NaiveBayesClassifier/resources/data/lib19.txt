but
Fox
News
New
rule
Sarah
Palin
needs
to
stay
away
from
sports
in
PA
After
getting
booed
by
Flyers
fans
during
the
opening
game
puck
drop
you'd
think
she'd
have
learned
her
lesson
by
now
After
all
Flyers
fans
booed
Santa
Claus
years
ago
so
they'll
boo
just
for
the
hell
of
it
without
a
dumbshit
VP
candidate
to
egg
them
on
Anyway
here's
Sarah
in
Erie
trying
to
get
fans
excited
about
the
Philadelphia
Phillies
World
Series
win
Oops
Most
folks
know
a
little
something
about
PA
and
here
at

de
Blogging
Out

we've
got
an
Erie-environs
native
to
prove
our
point
See
basically
you've
got
the
part
over
there
in
the
eastern
half
barely
considered
a
part
of
the
state
hell
Philadelphia
is
only
100
miles
from
commie
NYC
and
then
there's
the
rest
Erie
is
even
more
complicated
during
baseball
season
they
are
Pittsburgh
Pirates
fanatics
and
during
football
and
hockey
season
they're
rooting
for
Pittsburgh
Cleveland
AND
Buffalo
and
it's
all
rolled
into
one
nice
neat
amalgam
of
sports
craziness
Somebody
really
needs
to
vet
her
speeches
amongst
other
things

The
hits
just
keep
on
coming
The
closer
we
get
to
election
day
the
more
desperate
the
candidates
get
Take
Elizabeth
Dole
in
North
Carolina's
Senate
race
please
She's
in
the
fight
of
her
political
life
so
what
to
do
what
to
do
I
know
why
not
appeal
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
her
constituency
with
a
television
ad
like
this
FYI
that
voice
proclaiming
There
is
no
God
at

isn't
Kay
Hagan's
I
used
to
think
Dole
was
a
pretty
class
act
remember
when
she
headed
up
the
American
Red
Cross
Well
that's
all
gone
straight
to
the
gutter
I
guess
if
you're
going
down
might
as
well
take
your
dignity
with
it
What

Just
throwing
things
out
here
for
you
to
think
about
President
Bush's
AIDS
policy
for
Africa
coulda
shoulda
been
one
of
his
best
foreign
policy
achievements
Too
bad
ideology
took
over
and
squandered
the
whole
effort
Talking
about
sex
except
for
abstinence
is
a
big
no-no
for
the
Bushies
so
it's
all
turned
to
shit
Another
failure
to
go
on
the
pile
I
know
you
were
mega-pissed
when
Phil
Gramm
called
us
a
nation
of
whiners
but
Matt
Taibbi
brings
it
home
So
to
all
your
Republican
friends
who
will
get
unhinged
at
the
liberal
bias
in
the
news
if
Obama
wins
here's
what
he
has
to
say
Neither
the
government
nor
anyone
else
is
obligated
to
provide
you
with
an
inoffensive
psychological
environment
in
which
to
live
This
is
America
Fend
for
yourselves
you
assholes
Useless
questions
The
Advocate
asks
What
if
Milk
Hadn't
Been
Murdered
These
are
the
sort
of
things
which
don't
keep
me
up
at
night
It's
pointless
to
ponder
so
why
bother
It's
sort
of
like
asking
What
if
Gore
had
won
in
00
or
What
if
there
had
been
no
civil
rights
movement
Jason
makes
a
video
The
Old
McSame'Wich

it's

seconds

via
Chris
Hayes
said
on
Countdown
last
night
that
going
more
rogue
is
his
favorite
phrase
from
the
campaign
so
far
Mine
too
I'd
like
to
think
I've
been
doing
just
that
for
the
last
five
freakin
years
on
this
very
blog
but
I'm
just
not
sure
any
more
Anyways
it's
hard
to
imagine
Palin
going
any
further
off
base
at
this
point
but
a
warning
to
all
the
Sarah
bashers
on
the
Republican
side
dis
her
at
your
peril
mofos
she'll
cut
your
ass
like
a
cheap
pumpkin
There's
gonna
be
hell
to
pay
and
Todd
will
be
right
there
digging
up
the
dirt
and
handing
out
the
hall
passes
Something
tells
me
Bill
Kristol
is
going
to
be
first
in
line
to
hop
on
the
Palin
bandwagon
so
he's
their
new
student
body
Vice
President
Liberal
elite
media
my
ass
On
that
note
let's
see
what's
up
on
the
Sarah
and
John-John
reservation
Rogue
Diva
a
Sarah
Palin
impersonator
infiltrates
a
McCain
rally
and
mugs
for
the
camera
She's
my
new
hero
and
she's
got
a
future
Anybody
who
can
grab
a
prime
seat
at
a
McCain
rally...wait
a
minute
Anybody
can
get
a
prime
seat
at
a
McCain
rally
right
now
The
Vet
Who
Did
Not
Vet
tells
the
story
of
a
man
named
McCain
and
a
running
mate
saga
that's
worthy
of
you-know-who
My
That
campaign
has
turned
into
one
big
joke
and
40
of
the
electorate
is
falling
for
it

Eight
Days
A
Week
Screw
it
let's
have
a
cocktail
You
might
think
I'll
be
twiddling
my
thumbs
or
playing
with
my
vast
array
of
sex
toys
for
the
next
eight
days
since
I've
already
voted
but
how
wrong
you
would
be
I'm
a
multitasker
so
I
can
do
all
that
and
still
bring
you
the
best
and
brightest
from
the
campaign
trail
whilst
sipping
on
something
Now
that
Sarah
Palin
has
started
the
slow
yet
delicious
process
of
extracting
herself
from
the
failure
of
the
McCain
campaign
I
guess
it's
safe
for
the
rest
of
us
to
do
the
same
and
put
this
puppy
in
its
cage
and
call
it
a
night
The
only
problem
is
we've
got
eight
more
of
them
to
get
through
so
haul
out
the
Ambien
and
vodka
and
you'll
be
just
fine
OMG
look
at
what's
happened
to
rabid
homophobe
Rep
Marilyn
Musgrave's
district
and
state
While
she
was
busy
with
the
most-important
issue
of
the
day
after
9/11
banning
gay
marriage
it
looks
like
Colorado
went
and
changed
on
her
and
left
her
as
roadkill
Focus
on
your
own
damn
family
for
a
change
Marilyn
Leave
everybody
else's
alone
The
stupid
somebody
make
it
stop
Sen
Tom
Harkin's
opponent
labels
him
the
Tokyo
Rose
of
al-Qaida
Silly
man
Tokyo
Rose
had
a
vagina
and
a
radio
program
Hockey
moms
you
can
dress
like
Sarah
Palin
for
less
than
2500
Or
skip
that
and
just
dress
up
your
Barbie
Makeup
removal
kit
sold
separately
With
all
that
to
ponder
I'm
off
to
lube
up
and
get
plastered

Yep
I
laughed
It's
Friday
so
take
a
load
off
I
know
I
am
Before
I
start
spewing
absurdities
from
my
keyboard
like
some
idiots
running

Congress
of
late
I'll
take
a
break
from
all
that
and
give
you
a
big
break
as
well
I
only
have
so
much
strength
in
my
carpal
tunnel-riddled
hands
and
I'm
saving
it
up
for
my
big
150K
clothes
shopping
spree
at
Saks
later
on

that
here's
a

you
chill
