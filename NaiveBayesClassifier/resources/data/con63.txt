American
special
forces
were
tracking
Abu
Musab
al-Zarqawi
the
head
of
Al-Qaida
in
Iraq
near
the
town
of
Ramadi
two
months
ago
but
the
Jordanian-born
terrorist
leader
escaped
by
jumping
out
of
a
moving
vehicle
a
senior
U.S
military
source
tells
NBC
News
Al-Zarqawi
did
however
leave
behind
several
key
pieces
of
intelligence
the
source
said
the
most
important
of
which
was
his
laptop
computer
Photos
of
suspected
insurgents
released
by
the
military
last
month
were
taken
from
the
My
Pictures
folder
of
that
laptop
the
source
said
It
was
also
full
of
telephone
numbers
Also
left
behind
in
the
car
was
a
bag
with
about
100,000
in
euro
currency
Another
bag
contained
mini
plugin
harddrives
the
source
said
and
evidently
al-Zarqawi
was
using
these
to
distribute
information
to
his
network
in
Iraq
Along
with
those
items
he
must
have
left
his
intelligence
How
could
he
not
anticipate
the
possibility
of
having
his
laptop
fall
in
the
hands
of
our
forces
And
more
importantly
why
on
earth
did
he
not
try
to
at
least
make
a
feeble
attempt
to
encrypt
his
files
rather
than
simple
store
them
on
his

QUITO
Ecuador
Ousted
Ecuadorean
President
Lucio
Gutierrez
flew
to
political
asylum
in
Brazil
on
Sunday
four
days
after
he
was
toppled
by
massive
street
protests
and
sought
refuge
from
angry
demonstrators
in
the
Brazilian
ambassador's
residence
Gutierrez's
enemies
say
he
should
be
tried
for
abuse
of
power
corruption
and
the
violent
repression
of
protests
that
prompted
Wednesday's
congressional
vote
to
remove
him
from
office
His
supporters
say
he
was
removed
from
power
illegally
and
the
Organization
of
American
States
has
asked
Ecuador's
new
government
to
explain
how
Congress
justified
its
decision
to
remove
him
for
abandonment
of
the
post
when
he
was
still
in
the
Government
Palace
issuing
orders
Congress
justified
dismissing
Gutierrez
under
a
constitutional
clause
allowing
lawmakers
to
remove
a
president
for
abandonment
of
the
post
even
though
he
was
still
in
the
Government
Palace
issuing
orders
Backers
of
the
measure
argued
that
since
Gutierrez
had
not
faithfully
carried
out
his
responsibilities
Congress
should
declare
the
presidency
vacant
That's
the
problem
Congress
can
just
declare
the
presidency
vacant
and
that
he
did
not
fulfill
his
duties
rather
than
following
their
accusations
with
a
judicial
process
which
investigates
these
claims
Monicagate
in
the
U.S
anyone
It's
no
surprise
Ecuador
has
had
3
presidents
run
out
of
office
since
1997
In
a
resolution
Friday
the
OAS
avoided
explicit
recognition
of
the
government
of
President
Alfredo
Palacio
who
was
sworn
in
by
Congress
after
Gutierrez
was
removed
It
was
not
known
when
the
OAS
delegation
would
arrive
So
far
no
country
has
recognized
the
new
government
as
legitimate

no

OAS
to

on
mission
to

or
something
From
the
OAS
press
release
following
the
convening
of
the
Permanent
Council
earlier
this
afternoon
The
Organization
of
American
States
OAS
today
decided
to
send
a
high-level
mission
to
Ecuador
to
work
with
officials
of
that
country
and
with
all
sectors
of
Ecuadorian
society
in
their
effort
to
strengthen
democracy
The
decision
to
send
the
mission
was
made
in
accordance
with
Article
18
of
the
Inter-American
Democratic
Charter
and
in
keeping
with
an
invitation
issued
today
by
a
delegation
of
Ecuador
during
a
special
session
of
the
Permanent
Council
The
resolution
adopted
by
consensus
also
refers
to
the
OAS
Charter
noting
that
one
of
the
Organization's
essential
purposes
is
to
promote
and
consolidate
representative
democracy
with
due
respect
for
the
principle
of
nonintervention
sic
The
delegation
of
Ecuador
came
to
the
OAS
today
to
demand
its
solidarity
with
the
Ecuadorian
people
and
government
I
guess
nonintervention
can
be
translated
into
not
sending
in
blue
helments
like
the
U.N
but
rather
provide
Democratic
cheerleaders
to
encourage
a
return
to
stability
of
the
democratic

P.S
How

The

for

lack

A
few
minutes
ago
in
a
private
session
with
the
majority
of
the
Ecuadorian
congressmen
and
congresswomen
in
attendance
has
named
Alfredo
Palacio
as
the
new
president
of
Ecuador
According
to
reports
on
Radio
Sucre
congresswoman
Cinthya
Viteri
president
of
the
Congress
swore
in
Palacio
The
former
vice
president
said
in
his
first
speech
that
the
people
of
Ecuador
particularly
the
people
of
Quito
decided
to
end
the
dictatorship
immorality
arrogance
terror
and
fear
A
few
moments
ago
military
sources
confirmed
that
Lucio
Gutiérrez
has
abandoned
the
Carondelet
Palace
accompanied
by
his
wife
and
a
few
aides
The
only
information
known
at
the
moment
is
that
he
has
requested
political
asylum
at
the
Panamanian
embassy
UPDATE
According
to
Venezuelas
Globovision
Lucio
Gutiérrez
is
indeed
in
the
Brazilian
embassy
where
he
has
requested
political
asylum
in
that
country
He
seems
to
have
arrived
there
by
helicopter
after
protesters
prevented
him
from
leaving
the
coutnry
by
airplane
Protesters
hope
to
prevent
him
from
leaving
the
country
in
order
to
bring
charges
against
him
in
Ecuadorian
courts
It
is
still
difficult
to
know
quite
what
is
happening
in
the
wake
of
Gutiérrez
abandoning
the
presidency
Voices
on
Radio
La
Luna
one
of
the
main
forces
behind
the
movement
in
Quito
report
rumors
that
members
of
the
military
high
command
who
earlier
had
declared
their
support
for
Gutiérrez
despite
the
obvious
popular
rejection
of
his
rule
have
decided
not
to
recognizes
Palacio
as
the
legitimate
president
of
Ecuador
It
is
not
clear
where
Palacio
is
at
the
moment
and
for
some
time
now
he
has
not
appeared
at
the
presidential
palace
Carondelet
or
made
any
statement
Callers
from
the
streets
have
also
reported
pro-Gutiérrez
agents
trying
to
provoke
violence
in
the
streets
All
this
has
led
some
to
wonder
if
the
military
is
preparing
a
coup
detat
against
the
man
who
legally
took
the
presidency
today
with
the
backing
of
Congress
Hopefully
Palacios
whereabouts
will
be
known
soon
and
nasty
rumors
of
a
military
coup
can
be
written
off
as
just
that
UPDATE
The
headline
at
the
website
for
the
Brazilian
daily
O
Globo
reads
Brasil

ao
presidente
do
Equador
Brazil
gives
asylum
to
president
of
Ecuador
The
articles
can't
be
accessed
without
a
subscription
This
is
somewhat
surprising
Venezuela
had
already
denied
Gutiérrez
asylum
and
he
was
expected
to
try
to
head
to
Panama
He
is
now
hiding
out
in
the
Brazilian
embassy
with
Ecuadorian
police
under
orders
to
arrest
him
on
sight
The
coup
scenario
described
above
seems
to
have
been
as
hoped
merely
rumor
As
I
listen
to
Radio
La

whoever
is
speaking
now
just
closed
an
emotional
commentary
saying
Last
night
we
slept
under

we
woke

and
said
that
the

in

is
by

a
case
of
an
alteration
of
constitutional
regime
that
seriously
impairs
the

Barberis
added
that
it
is
on
the
contrary
a

Karl
von
Wogau
Chairman
of
the
European
Parliament
Subcommittee
on
Security
and
Defence
today
urged
the
EU's
plenary
session
gathered
in
Strasbourg
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
sale
of
weapons
by
Spain
to
Venezuela
violates
the
Code
of
Conduct
on
Arms
Exports
of
the
European
Union
During
the
opening
of
the
plenary
session
of
the
European
Parliament
at
its
seat
in
the
French
city
the
German
member
of
the
EU
parliament
warned
that
the
exportation
of
arms
to
Venezuela
may
very
well
go
against
the
Code
of
Conduct
on
Arms
Exports
agreed
to
by
countries
of
the
EU
and
in
force
since
1998
Von
Wogau
urged
the
president
of
the
European
Parliament
Josep
Borrell
a
Spanish
member
of
the
EUP
to
verify
to
what
extent
these
actions
infringe
upon
the
resolutions
of
the
code
in
question
so
reported
AFP
According
to
the
German
member
of
the
parliament
the
contract
may
very
well
violate
the
fourth
point
of
the
aforementioned
code
which
establishes
that
member
States
are
to
refrain
from
exporting
arms
to
third
countries
if
it
entails
a
threat
against
the
peace
security
and
stability
of
the
region
During
his
address
von
Wogau
also
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
the
aforementioned
sale
is
in
compliance
with
the
Principle
of
Prudence
to
which
the
European
Union
and
its
member
States
must
adhere
anytime
they
export
arms
to
third
countries
Last
Wednesday
US
Secretary
of
Defence
Ronald
Rumsfeld
openly
criticised
Spain
for
the
sale
of
weapons
to
Venezuela
affirming
that
it
had
been
an
error

organize

were
not

effective
but
inspired
the
B
Company

Battalion
Soldiers
He
then
began
to
lead
by
example
As
the
Bradley
arrived
on
site
and
moved
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
toward
the
gate
Sgt
1st
Class
Smith
ran
to
the
gate
wall
and
threw
a
fragmentation
grenade
at
the
enemy
He
then
took
two
Soldiers
forward
to
join
the
guards
and
directed
their
engagement
of
the
enemy
with
small
arms
The
enemy
continued
to
fire
rifles
RPGs
and
60mm
mortars
at
the
Soldiers
on
the
street
and
within
the
courtyard
Enemy
soldiers
began
moving
along
the
buildings
on
the
north
side
of
the
clearing
to
get
into
position
to
climb
into
the
towers
Sgt
1st
Class
Smith
called
for
an
APC
to
move
forward
to
provide
additional
fire
support
Sgt
1st
Class
Smith
then
fired
an
AT-4
at
the
enemy
while
directing
his
fire
team
assembled
near
the
front
line
of
the
engagement
area
Running
low
on
ammunition
and
having
taken

the
Bradley
withdrew
to
reload
The
lead
APC
in
the
area
received
a
direct
hit
from
a
mortar
wounding
the
three
occupants
The
enemy
attack
was
at
its
strongest
point
and
every
action
counted
Not

were
the
wounded
Soldiers
threatened
but
also
more
than
100
Soldiers
from
B
Company
the
Task
Force
Aid
Station
and
the

were
at
risk
Sgt
1st

ordered
one
of
his
Soldiers
to
back
the
damaged
APC
back
into
the
courtyard
after
the
wounded
men
had
been
evacuated
Knowing
the
APC
s
50-Cal
machinegun
was
the
largest
weapon
between
the
enemy
and
the
friendly
position
Sgt
1st

Smith
immediately
assumed
the
track
commander's
position
behind
the
weapon
and
told
a
soldier
who
accompanied
him
to
feed
me
ammunition
whenever
you
hear
the
gun
get
quiet
Sgt
1st
Class
Smith
fired
on
the
advancing
enemy
from
the
unprotected
position
atop
the
APC
and
expended
at
least
three
boxes
of
ammunition
before
being
mortally
wounded
by
enemy
fire
The
enemy
attack
was
defeated
Sgt

actions
saved
the
lives
of
at

100
Soldiers
caused

hours
after

Volunteers
to
Patrol
Arizona-Mexico
Border
By

BILLEAUD
Associated
Press
TOMBSTONE
Ariz
About
450
volunteers
gathered
Friday
for
a
monthlong
effort
to
patrol
the
Mexican
border
for
illegal
immigrants
and
smugglers
an
organizer
of
the
project
said
The
idea
according
to
organizers
of
the
Minuteman
Project
is
for
the
volunteers
to
fan
out
across
23
miles
of
the
San
Pedro
Valley
to
watch
the
border
and
report
any
illegal
activity
to
federal
agents
an
exercise
some
law
enforcement
authorities
and
others
fear
could
lead
to
vigilante
violence
Many
volunteers
were
recruited
over
the
Internet
and
some
plan
to
be
armed
Patrols
are
to
begin
Monday
Chris
Simcox
Minuteman
field
operations
director
said
450
people
were
willing
to
participate
in
at
least
one
shift
in
the
desert
He
wouldn't
say
how
many
had
registered
or
had
participated
in
orientation
Others
would
arrive
later
in
the
month
he
said
Jim
Gilchrist
a
retired
accountant
from
California
who
organized
the
project
said
earlier
at
least
100
volunteers
had
registered
There
was
no
immediate
way
to
independently
verify
the
count
and
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
volunteers
from
counter-protesters
tourists
and
the
merely
curious
in
this
town
nearly
30
miles
north
of
the
Mexican
border
best
known
as
the
site
of
the
1881
shootout
at
the
OK
Corral
Gilchrist
said
the
government
has
said
for
decades
it's
responsible
for
and
will
deal
with
illegal
immigration
We
are
no
longer
in
the
request
mode
the
suggest
mode
or
the
recommendation
mode
Gilchrist
said
We
are

During

Dozens
of

mounted
a

prison
outside
Baghdad
on
Saturday
detonating
two
suicide
car
bombs
and
firing
rocket

grenades
before
U.S

repelled
the
assault
At
least
20
U.S

and
12
detainees
were
wounded
in
the
carefully
planned
attack
which
began
at
around
1500

and
lasted
for
around
an
hour
the

They
detonated
two

suicide
car
bombs

also
fired
rocket-propelled
grenades
into

it
was

he

Mortars
and
small

fire
were
also
directed
toward
the
prison
on

western
edge
The
attacks
were
intermittent
They
would
fire
RPGs
and
then
stop
then
they
would
attack
again
Rudisill
said
U.S

responded
with
heavy
weapons
eventually
bringing
the
situation
under
control
It
was
not

how
many
insurgents
were
wounded
or
killed
in
the
battle
Just
a
little
note
to
keep
in

Abu
Ghraib
is
home
to
approximately
2,000
prisoners--a

escape
would
not

A

convicted
a
23-year-old

mechanic
of
willfully
disobeying

for
refusing

perform
duties
after

an

Monday
Specialist
Blake
Lemoine
who
returned
to

in
May

said
he
wanted
to
quit

between

Lemoine

sponsored
by

groups
that
even
though
he
volunteered
to
join
the
army
he
had
changed
his
mind
and
wanted
to
leave
It
was
simply
a
slow
realisation
that
serving
in
the
U.S
military
at
this
day
and
time
contradicts
my
religion
and
to
continue
to
do
so
would

he

Lemoine
had
also
been

in

as
saying
The
contract
with

He
also
spoke
out
against

violence
against

saying
Iraqi

are
often
treated
worse

Lemoine
joined

for
three
years
a
term
which
would
have
ended
on
Feb
13

extended
his

I

said
Joseph

Russell

he
does

to

States
rights
WASHINGTON
AP
The
Supreme
Court
ruled
Tuesday
that
the
Constitution
forbids
the
execution
of
killers
who
were
under
18
when
they
committed
their
crimes
ending
a
practice
used
in
19
states
The
5-4
decision
throws
out
the
death
sentences
of
about
70
juvenile
murderers
and
bars
states
from
seeking
to
execute
minors
for
future
crimes
The
executions
the
court
said
violate
the
Eighth
Amendment
ban
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
The
ruling
continues
the
court's
practice
of
narrowing
the
scope
of
the
death
penalty
which
justices
reinstated
in
1976
The
court
in
1988
outlawed
executions
for
those
15
and
younger
when
they
committed
their
crimes
Three
years
ago
justices
banned
executions
of
the
mentally
retarded
Tuesday's
ruling
prevents
states
from
making
16
and
17-year-olds
eligible
for
execution
The
age
of
18
is
the
point
where
society
draws
the
line
for
many
purposes
between
childhood
and
adulthood
It
is
we
conclude
the
age
at
which
the
line
for
death
eligibility
ought
to
rest
Justice
Anthony
Kennedy
wrote
Juvenile
offenders
have
been
put
to
death
in
recent

in
only
a
few
other

It
is
proper
that
we
acknowledge
the
overwhelming
weight
of
international
opinion
against
the
juvenile
death
penalty
resting
in
large
part
on
the
understanding
that
the
instability
and
emotional
imbalance
of
young
people
may
often
be
a

In
a
dissent
Justice
Antonin
Scalia
disputed
that
there
is
a
clear
trend
of
declining
juvenile
executions
to
justify
a
growing
consensus
against
the
practice
The
court
says
in
so
many
words
that
what
our
people's
laws
say
about
the
issue
does
not
in

In

Hey
gang
As
you
could
probably
tell
from
my
last
post
my
friend
Eric's
family
is
going
through
a
difficult
time
right
now
grieving
the
loss
of
a
loved
one
For
the
next
few
days
or
until
Eric
comes
back
I
will
be
taking
a
blogcation
to
the
tropical
exotic
cyber-isle
of

Morire
I
will
be
hanging
out
there
so
make
sure
you
stop
by
for
a
visit
I
can
assure
you
you'll
encounter
the
same
crazy
commodities
you're
accustomed
to
here
at
Whatsakyer
And
since
I'm
not

on

just
ask

you'll

NEWSFLASH
Anything
you
put
in
your
body
will
cause
cancer
January

2005
BY
JIM
RITTER
Health
Reporter
Eating
lots
of
red
meat
and
processed
meat
can
increase
the
risk
of
colon
cancer
by
as
much
as
50
percent
a
major
study
has
found
But
a
separate
study
found
eating
lots
of
fruits
and
vegetables
did
not
protect
against
breast
cancer
Both
studies
are
published
in
the
Journal
of
the
American
Medical
Association
In
the
meat
study
American
Cancer
Society
researchers
examined
surveys
of
nearly
150,000
adults
Men
and
women
aged
50
to
74
were
asked
about
their
eating
habits
in
1982
and
1992-93
and
were
followed
through
2001
Those
who
ate
at
least
three
ounces
of
red
meat
per
day
in
both
surveys
were
29
percent
more
likely
to
get
cancer
in
the
distal
colon
near
the
rectum
than
those
who
ate
little
or
no
red
meat
Among
those
who
ate
the
highest
amounts
of
processed
meat
the
risk
was
50
percent
higher
Red
meat
includes
beef
pork
ham
and
liver
Processed
meat
includes
bacon
sausage
hot
dogs
ham
bologna
salami
and
lunchmeat
Three
ounces
is
equivalent
to
a
large
fast-food
hamburger
puts
down
fork
grabs
bottle
of
A1
and
pours
onto
plate
containing
18oz
New
York
Strip
and
commences
the
devouring
process
Give
me
a
break
If
you
can
stomach
the
rest
of
the
article
it
later
recommends
eating
FISH
instead
of
meat
For
starters
the
article
failed
to
mention
that
we
should
eat
wild
fish
rather
than
farm-raised
fish
such
as
catfish
for
example
Why
Because
apparently
the
water
supply
on
these
farms
are
compromised
with
chemicals
and
the
such
Secondly
if
you
put
a
plate
of
blackened
or
cajun
salmon
in
front
of
me
and
then
a
nice
sirloin
cut
next
to
it
and
ask
me
to
choose
I'm
going
to
knock
you
out
and
eat
BOTH
OF
THEM
Why
do
I
sense
PETA
is
somehow
behind
this
sceme...to
gradually
scare
everyone
off
of
every
living

of
trying

a

in

The

expressed
concern
that

are
exploiting
the

An

As

a
young
woman
sat
down

to
him
She

to
the

asked
Are

Well

pulling

between

the

It

said
some

work
The
misconduct
was
serious

found
it
disturbing
that
there
was
no
program
in

to
deter
misconduct
or
protect
civilians

the
report
added
The

looked
into
72
allegations
against

civilian
U.N

which
resulted
in
20
case
reports

2004

an
article
by

UK):U.N
Peacekeepers
involved
in

sex
scandal
in

All
I
have
to

is
this
If
the
poor
and
the
oppressed
and
disease
and
hunger
stricken
of
the
world
have
to
worry
about
foreign
peacekeepers
coming
in
and
raping
their
young
women--after
a
war
in
which
such
actions
probably
already
occurred...who
will
protect
them
During
the
horrible
era
of
ethnic
cleansing
in
Kosovo
the
military
would
rape
and
defile
the
women
young
and
old
read
pre-pubescent
to
elderly
in
front
of
the
men
and
family--subsequently
psychologically
traumatizing
entire
villages
How
is
this
any
different
Where
is
the
conviction
and
decency
in
the
hearts
of
every
U.N
peacekeeper
that
is
supposed
to
represent
the
most
noble

altruistic

U.S
authorities
have
remained
strangely
silent
regarding
the
Colombian
government's
decision
to
delay
or
cancel
the
extradition
of
AUC
Chief
Salvatore
Mancuso
on
cocaine
trafficking
and
money
laundering
charges
THE
NARCO-TERRORIST
WHO
CAME
IN
FROM
THE
COLD
Why
Isn't
Mancuso
being
Extradited
On
December
11
Stewart
Tuttle
head
of
the
Political
Affairs
division
of
the
U.S
Embassy
in
Bogota
looked
on
as
Salvatore
Mancuso
commander
of
Colombia's
largest
and
most
brutal
network
of
right-wing
death
squads
ceremonially
surrendered
his
Berretta
to
Colombian
Peace
Commissioner
Carlos
Luis
Restrepo
But
Tuttle
and
his
superiors
were
strangely
silent
a
week
later
when
the
government
of
President
Alvaro
Uribe
announced
that
it
would
not
extradite
Mancuso
to
the
U.S
to
face
cocaine
trafficking
and
money
laundering
charges
as
long
as
the
death
squad
leader
agreed
to
cease
all
illegal
activities
and
encourage
other
paramilitaries
to
take
part
in
the
government's
demobilization
process
While
the
U.S
hasn't
formally
dropped
its
extradition
request
neither
the
U.S
Embassy
nor
the
U.S
State
Department
has
issued
a
public
statement
about
Uribe's
decision
to
delay
or
cancel
Mancuso's
handover
to
U.S
authorities
which
is
highly
unusual
to
say
the
least
given
that
Mancuso
is
the
head
of
a
terrorist
organization
and
is
accused
of
conspiring
to
smuggle
over
seventeen
tons
of
cocaine
to
the
U.S
and
Europe
yet...they
gladly
accepted
a
F.A.R.C
terrorist
instead.--.ed
THE
CHARGES
AGAINST
MANCUSO
The
U.S
State
Department
has
classified
Mancuso's
organization
the
Self
Defense
Forces
of
Colombia
AUC
as
a
Foreign
Terrorist
Organization
the
same
legal
designation
that
it
applies
to
groups
like
Ansar
al-Islam
al-Qa'ida
and
Hamas
According
to
its
website
the
policy
of
the
State
Department's
Counterterrorism
Office
which
compiles
the
list
of
terrorist
organizations
is
to
make
no
concessions
to
terrorists
and
strike
no
deals
and
to
bring
terrorists
to
justice
for
their
crime
Involvement
in
the
operation
of
a
Foreign
Terrorist
Organization
is
a
capital
offense
under
the
PATRIOT
Act
According
to
the
State
Department's
2004
Human
Rights
Report
on
Colombia
compiled
under
Tuttle's
supervision
the
AUC
remains
actively
involved
in
terrorist
operations
throughout
Colombia
Despite
cease-fires
declared
in
the
context
of
demobilization
negotiations
conducted
by
the
AUC--an
umbrella
organization
of
different
paramilitary
terrorist
groups--with
the
Government
these
terrorists
continued
to
commit
numerous
unlawful
and
political
killings
including
of
labor
leaders
often
kidnapping
and
torturing
suspected
guerrilla
sympathizers
prior
to
executing
them
They
also
conducted
kidnappings
for
ransom
and
committed
social
cleansing
killings
of
homosexuals
and
other
supposedly
undesirable
elements
The
AUC
terrorists
often
interfered
with
personal
privacy
in
areas
where
they
exercised
de
facto
control
and
regularly
engaged
in
military
operations
in
which
they
endangered
civilian
lives
by
fighting
in
urban
areas
and
using
civilian
dwellings
as
combat
shelter
AUC
terrorists
displaced
thousands
through
both
terror-induced
forced
displacements
of
suspect
populations
and
military
operations
that
drove
peasants
from
their
homes
AUC
terrorists
regularly
threatened
and
attacked
human
rights
workers
and
journalists
who
criticized
their
illegal
activities
They
also
recruited
child
soldiers
Important
strategic
and
financial
areas
continued
to
be
heavily
contested
especially
as
the
Government
eradicated
coca
crops
and
created
anti-kidnapping
task
forces
Mancuso
has
been
the
main
public
face
of
the
AUC
since
the
disappearance
of
the
organization's
founder
Carlos
Castano
last
year
Sources
in
the
Colombian
human
rights
community
allege
that
Castano
is
currently
in
hiding
in
Israel
Why
Israel
I've
yet
to
find
out.--.ed
Mancuso's
role
in
massacres
disappearances
and
assassinations
would
be
sufficient
grounds
for
his
prosecution
for
war
crimes
and
crimes
against
humanity
But
the
U.S
also
claims
that
Mancuso
was
involved
in
a
major
cocaine
trafficking
operation
designed
by
Castano
to
fund
the
AUC
In
a
September
24
2002
press
conference
announcing
the
indictment
of
Castano
Mancuso
and
a
third
AUC
leader
U.S
Attorney
General
John
Ashcroft
said
Today's
indictment
charges
AUC
leaders
not
as
the
anti-FARC
freedom
fighters
they
claim
to
be
but
as
criminals
violent
drug
traffickers
who
poison
our
citizens
and
threaten
our
national
security
According
to
the
indictment
Carlos
Castaño
directed
cocaine
production
and
distribution
activities
in
AUC-controlled
regions
of
Colombia
including
protecting
coca
processing
laboratories
setting
quality
and
price
controls
for
cocaine
and
arranging
for
and
protecting
cocaine
shipments
both
within
and
outside
of
Colombia
Castaño
and
his
co-defendants
used
violence
force
and
intimidation
to
maintain
this
authority
over
cocaine
trafficking
activities
For
example
the
indictment
alleges
that
Castaño
resorted
to
kidnaping
and
threats
and
that
Salvatore
Mancuso
caused
the
brutal
murder
of
another
Colombian
drug
trafficker
as
retribution
for
failing
to
pay
a
drug
debt
He
went
on
to
emphasize
the
seriousness
of
the
charges
saying
The
men
named
in
the
indictment
are
accused
of
selling
one
of
the
most
dangerous
and
addictive
drugs
cocaine
Cocaine
including
its
derivative
form
crack
remains
the
most
frequently
mentioned
drug
in
14
of
the
20
cities
in
the
Drug
Abuse
Warning
Network
In
addition
cocaine
accounted
for
50
percent
of
all
drug-related
episodes
in
emergency
rooms
between
1999
and
2000
Today
we
see
more
clearly
than
ever
the
interdependence
between
the
terrorists
that
threaten
American
lives
and
the
illegal
drugs
that
threaten
American
potential
As
today's
indictment
reminds
us
the
lawlessness
that
breeds
terrorism
is
also
a
fertile
ground
for
the
drug
trafficking
that
supports
terrorism
To
surrender
to
either
of
these
threats
is
to
surrender
to
both
Tough
words
But
the
U.S
has
not
followed
them
up
with
action
Earlier
this
year
the
Colombian
government
suspended
its
own
arrest
order
against
Mancuso
and
allowed
him
to
address
the
Colombian
legislature
the
U.S
remained
silent
And
military
aid
has
continued
to
flow
to
Colombia
even
though
the
State
Department
admits
that
there
are
widespread
ties
between
the
Colombian
military
and
the
AUC
and
human
rights
groups
have
documented
the
role
of
the
AUC
in
the
election
of
President
Uribe
TALKING
WITH
TERRORISTS
Despite
the
State
Department's
stated
policy
of
refusing
to
negotiate
with
terrorists
both
the
Colombian
and
the
U.S
press
reported
that
U.S
Embassy
officials
met
with
representatives
of
the
AUC
in
May
0f
2003
to
discuss
the
indictements
against
Castano
and
Mancuso
See
Luis
Gomez's
report
Colombian
sources
place
Stewart
Tuttle
and
his
deputy
Alex
Lee
at
these
meetings
and
it
seems
clear
that
neither
man
would
have
jeopardized
his
career
by
meeting
with
terrorists
in
possible
violation
of
the
PATRIOT
act
without
authorization
from
somewhere
much
higher
in
the
chain
of
command
In
the
weeks
that
followed
the
revelations
about
these
meetings
Tuttle
and
Lee
who
had
previously
met
frequently
with
U.S
visitors
to
Colombia
disappeared
from
the
Embassy's
briefing
room
During
this
time
an
Embassy
official
speaking
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
acknowledged
that
the
meetings
had
taken
place
but
insisted
that
the
Embassy
was
merely
trying
to
reiterate
its
desire
to
have
Mancuso
and
Castano
surrender
themselves
to
U.S
authorities
Does
this
mean
that
if
they
were
stationed
in
Afghanistan
or
Pakistan
Tuttle
and
Lee
would
meet
with
representatives
of
al
Qu'aida
to
reiterate
their
desire
to
see
Osama
bin
Laden
surrender
for
prosecution
Apparently
however
Tuttle
no
longer
sees
the
need
to
reiterate
the
U.S.'s
desire
to
put
Mancuso
behind
bars
And
its
hard
to
believe
that
the
Colombian
government
would
cancel
its
plans
to
extradite
Mancuso
without
consulting
the
Bush
administration
What
remains
to
be
seen
is
who
in
the
U.S
decided
to
let
Salvatore
Mancuso
get
away
So
much
for
the
war
on
terror
Meanwhile
according
to
multiple
reports
Ricardo
Palmera
aka
Simón
Trinidad
is
en
route
to
be
the
first
guerrilla
tried
in
the
States
on
charges
of
narco-trafficking
and
other
terrorist
related
charges
The
one-sided
negotiated
deal
from
Uribe's
govt
was
rejected
by
Palmera
in
favor
of
a
prisoner/hostage
exchange
to
be
coordinated
by
the
U.N
As
reported
in
the
Miami
Herald
Palmera's
lawyer
Oscar
Emilio
Silva
asserts
Uribe's
government
knowingly
offered
a
deal
Palmera
would
reject
They
threw
the
ball
in
the
FARC's
court
in
order
to
make
it
look

the
FARC's
fault

The

What

Despite
a
year
of
ferocious
combat
mounting
casualties
and
frequent
deployments
support
for
the
war
in
Iraq
remains
very
high
among
the
active-duty
military
according
to
a
Military
Times
Poll
Sixty-three
percent
of
respondents
approve
of
the
way
President
Bush
is
handling
the
war
and
60
remain
convinced
it
is
a
war
worth
fighting
Support
for
the
war
is
even
greater
among
those
who
have
served
longest
in
the
combat
zone
Two-thirds
of
combat
vets
say
the
war
is
worth
fighting
But
the
men
and
women
in
uniform
are
under
no
illusions
about
how
long
they
will
be
fighting
in
Iraq
nearly
half
say
they
expect
to
be
there
more
than
five
years
In
addition
87
say
they're
satisfied
with
their
jobs
and
if
given
the
choice
today
only
25
say
they'd
leave
the
service
Compared
with
last
year
the
percentages
for
support
for
the
war
and
job
satisfaction
remain
essentially
unchanged
A
year
ago
77
said
they
thought
the
military
was
stretched
too
thin
to
be
effective
This
year
that
number
shrank
to
66
The

As
I
sat
here
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
Christmas
Eve
I
began
to
wonder
if
anyone
that
happened
across
this
blog
might
wonder
why
Christmas
should
be
a
Merry
event
Because
Santa
Clause
brings
us
presents
How
about
getting
to
see
all
of
the
family
we
seem
to
drift
away
from
through
the
course
of
life
each
year
I
know
It's
the
relief
brought
about
by
a
few
much-needed
days
off
from
work...right
All
perfectly
valid
and
good
reasons
to
be
merry
but
is
there
something
else
Yes
Read
on
John
3:16
For
God
so
loved
the
world
that
He
gave
His
only
begotten
son
that
whosoever
believes
in
Him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
life
Ever
heard
the
phrase
Jesus
Is
The
Reason
For
The
Season
It's
true
Christians
are
especially
merry
at
Christmas
time
not
just
because
of
the
family
the
food
fun
presents
and
vacation
we
enjoy
we
know
that
Christmas
is
the
hallmark
of
joy
It
is
the
celebration
of
the
most
signifigant
turning
point
in
Earth's
history
You
see
God
loves
us
and
although
He
cannot
tolerate
our
sin
He
found
a
way
to
redeem
us
and
bring
us
back
into
fellowship
with
Him
He
sent
His
son
Jesus
to
earth
to
be
born
as
a
man
to
grow
up
as
we
do
to
fully
experience
life
in
all
of
its
wonders
amazement
and
yes
even
temptation
But
unlike
us
Jesus
did
not
give
into
temptation
ever
Not
once
did
He
ever
sin
That
is
why
He
was
able
to
become
the
perfect
sacrifice
on
the
cross
for
our
sins
He
took
our
guilt
upon
Himself
willingly
and
died
to
make
us
free
And
that
is
why
we
celebrate
His
birth
Furthermore
that
is
the
real
reason
why
Christmas
is
merry
Merry
Christmas
to
you
Enjoy
this
holiday
season
slow
down
and
get
to
know
your
family
and
friends
again
Most
importantly
if
you
don't
know
Jesus
as
your
personal
Lord
and
Saviour
you
won't
have
to
look
far
to
find
Him
He's
patiently
waiting
for
you
to
notice
that
He's
already
found
you
But
only
you
can
decide
to
let
Him
in

U.N
Peacekeepers
involved

rampant
sex
scandal

Sex
scandal
in
Congo
threatens
to
engulf
UN's
peacekeepers
By
Jonathan
Clayton
and
James
Bone
They
should
be
rebuilding
the
country
but
foreign
workers
face
serious
accusations
HOME-MADE
pornographic
videos
shot
by
a
United
Nations
logistics
expert
in
the
Democratic
Republic
of
Congo
have
sparked
a
sex
scandal
that
threatens
to
become
the
UN's
Abu
Ghraib
The
expert
was
a
Frenchman
who
worked
at
Goma
airport
as
part
of
the
UN's
700
million-a-year
effort
to
rebuild
the
war-shattered
country
When
police
raided
his
home
they
discovered
that
he
had
turned
his
bedroom
into
a
studio
for
videotaping
and
photographing
sex
sessions
with
young
girls
The
bed
was
surrounded
by
large
mirrors
on
three
sides
according
to
a
senior
Congolese
police
officer
On
the
fourth
side
was
a
camera
that
he
could
operate
from
the
bed
with
a
remote
control
When
the
police
arrived
the
man
was
allegedly
about
to
rape
a
12-year-old
girl
sent
to
him
in
a
sting
operation
Three
home-made
porn
videos
and
more
than
50
photographs
were
found
The
case
has
highlighted
the
apparently
rampant
sexual
exploitation
of
Congolese
girls
and
women
by
the
UN's
11,000
peacekeepers
and
1,000
civilians
at
a
time
when
the
UN
is
facing
many
problems
including
the
Iraqi
oil-for-food
scandal
and
accusations
of
sexual
harassment
by
senior
UN
staff
in
Geneva
and
New
York
The
prospect
of
the
pornographic
videos
and
photographs
now
on
sale
in
Congo
becoming
public
worries
senior
UN
officials
who
fear
a
UN
version
of
the
scandal
at
the
American-run
Abu
Ghraib
jail
in
Iraq
It
would
be
a
pretty
big
problem
for
the
UN
if
these
pictures
come
out
one
senior
official
said
You
mean
when
they
come
out!--ed
Investigations
have
already
turned
up
150
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
by
peacekeepers
and
UN
staff
despite
the
UN's
official
policy
of
zero-tolerance
One
found
68
allegations
of
misconduct
in
the
town
of
Bunia
alone
UN
insiders
told
The
Times
that
two
Russian
pilots
based
in
Mbandaka
paid
young
girls
with
jars
of
mayonnaise
and
jam
to
have
sex
with
them
They
filmed
the
sessions
and
sent
the
tapes
to
Russia
But
the
men
were
tipped
off
and
left
the
area
before
UN
investigators
arrived
The
Moroccan
peacekeeping
contingent
based
in
Kisangani
a
town
on
the
Congo
River
with
no
road
links
to
the
outside
world
had
one
of
the
worst
reputations
A
soldier
accused
of
rape
was
apparently
hidden
in
the
barracks
for
a
year
In
July
2002
the
rebel
commander
Major-General
Jean
Pierre
Ondekane
who
subsequently
became
Minister
of
Defence
in
a
postwar
transitional
government
told
a
top
UN
official
that
all
that
Monuc
the
United
Nations
Mission
in
the
Democratic
Republic
of
Congo
would
be
remembered
for
in
Kisangani
was
for
running
after
little
girls
An
international
organisation
examining
the
sex
trade
between
Monuc
and
local
women
found
that
in
March
there
were
82
women
and
girls
who
had
been
made
pregnant
by
Moroccan
men
and
59
more
by
Uruguayan
men
According
to
UN
insiders
at
least
two
UN
officials
a
Ukrainian
and
a
Canadian
have
had
to
leave
the
country
after
getting
local
women
pregnant
Jordan's
Prince
Zeid
Raad
Al
Hussein
a
special
adviser
to
the
UN
Secretary-General
who
led
one
investigative
team
said
in
a
confidential
report
obtained
by
The
Times
The
situation
appears
to
be
one
of
zero-compliance
with
zero
tolerance
throughout
the
mission
Sexual
exploitation
and
abuse
mostly
involves
the
exchange
of
sex
for
money
on
average
between
1
52p
and
3
for
food
for
immediate
consumption
or
to
barter
or
for
jobs
especially
affecting
daily
workers
the
prince's
report
said
In
addition
victims
spoke
of
incidents
of
rape
as
well
as
rape
disguised
as
prostitution
where
a
girl
was
raped
and
then
given
money
or
food
afterwards
to
give
the
appearance
of
a
transaction
having
taken
place
Three
civilian
UN
staff
have
already

A
man
who
worked
for
the
UN's
investigative
arm
in
Kinshasa
has
resigned

being

of
consorting
with

accused
of
paedophilia
was

The
fact

these

Jean-Marie
Guehenno
the

is
to
get
to
the

The

has

forbids

with

or
women
under
the
age
of
18
even
though
the
Congolese
age
of
consent
is
14
But
the
UN
continues
to
hand
out
free
condoms
to
peacekeepers
because
of
the
fear
of
Aids
Oh
yes
because
it
would
be
just
terrible
if
one
of
the
U.N
peacekeepers
contracted
AIDS
from
a
14
year-old
wouldn't
it???--ed
A
second
internal
UN
report
also
obtained
by
The
Times
detailed
the
extent
of
prostitution
by
street
girls
and
girlfriends
in
Kisangani
One
strategy
is
to
find
another
UN
staffer
with
a
girl
friend
and
ask
the
girl
if
she
knows
a
friend
She
will
usually
be
only
too
happy
to
comply
and
a
more
or
less
suitable
candidate
will
be
dispatched
to

staff

With

raging
in

Europe
during
World
War
II
workers
at
a
Brunswick
shipyard
were
determined
to
deliver
one

by
year's
end
To
get
the
job
done
laborers
were
needed
around
the
clock
on
Christmas
Day
About
1,500
volunteered
and
they
worked
for
free
If
only
Americans
today
pulled
together
for
the
good
of
the
troops
like
these
patriots
did
many
years
ago
But
hey

Divisions
over
Iraq
war
delay
a
soldier's
tribute
By
Rick
Hampson
USA
TODAY
The
young
soldier
tried
to
sound
brave
but
his
mother
could
hear
the
fear
in
his
voice
all
the
way
from
Iraq
news
web
sites
Before
the
satellite
phone
cut
out
he
made
a
request
the
prayer
of
every
soldier
in
peril
Just
don't
forget
me
Those
were
the
last
words
Regina
Gilbert
ever
heard
spoken
by
her
only
child
Three
weeks
later
Pfc
Kyle
Gilbert
was
killed
in
Baghdad
leaving
his
parents
and
community
the
sad
but
seemingly
simple
task
of
granting
his
final
wish
In
a
town
divided
by
the
war
there
was
a
symbolic
solution
Name
a
bridge
a
span
between
opposite
sides
for
Kyle
Charles
Gilbert
1983-2003
It
seemed
an
idea
everyone
could
embrace
But
not
as
it
turned
out
if
Kyle's
marker
bore
the
likeness
of
an
American
eagle
Or
the
slogan
Freedom
isn't
free
Or
the
name
Operation
Iraqi
Freedom
In
the
end
it
took
a
year
to
honor
Kyle
Gilbert
We
just
wanted
to
remember
Kyle
his
mother
says
But
things
got
politicized
Brattleboro's
struggle
to
remember
its
fallen
son
illustrates
how
the
Iraq
war
can
divide
people
even
when
they're
merely
trying
to
honor
the
dead
even
when
they
try
to
do
so
without
offending
anyone
The
U.S
military
death
toll
in
Iraq
has
risen
from
about
255
when
Kyle
Gilbert
was
shot
to
1,286
as
of
Sunday
More
and
more
communities
face
the
same
challenge
To
remember
the
warriors
without
necessarily
endorsing
the
war
Kyle
Gilbert's
parents
never
imagined
that
memorializing
their
son
could
be
such
an
ordeal
But
he
had
never
asked
for
much
besides
pizza
and
so
they
resolved
to
do
whatever
it
took
to
grant
his
last
wish
Gilbert
joined
a
peacetime
military
with
no
intention
of
killing
or
dying
When
he
enlisted
shortly
after
graduation
from
high
school
in
2001
he
wanted
to
develop
his
interest
in
electronics
earn
money
for
college
and
learn
to
jump
out
of
airplanes
as
his
father
had
in
Army
Special
Forces
a
quarter-century
earlier
He
was
in
jump
school
at
Fort
Benning
Ga
with
the
Army's
82nd
Airborne
Division
on
Sept
11
2001
Kyle
knew
what
that
meant
his
mother
says
He
knew
there
was
going
to
be
a
war
At
jump
school
graduation
according
to
tradition
father
and
son
exchanged
their
silver
wings
pins
and
Bob
pinned
his
to
Kyle's
chest
Eighteen
months
later
the
82nd
Airborne
marched
into
Baghdad
Saddam
Hussein
news
web
sites)'s
statue
fell
and
President
Bush
news

flew
onto
an
aircraft
carrier
in
the
Pacific
and
declared
major
combat
over
Kyle
and
his
buddies
made
friends
with
local
kids
and
went
swimming
at
one
of
Saddam's
palaces
A
town's
twin
cultures
In
Brattleboro
which
has
been
called
a
college
town
without
the
college
the
war
was
more
complicated
The
community
has
two
cultures
One
traces
its
origins
to
communes
that
sprouted
here
in
the
1960s
the
other
is
rooted
in
traditional
conservative
rural
Vermont
The
first
group
was
most
concerned
with
opposing
the
war
the
second
with
supporting
the
troops
The
town
commons
was
the
site
of
many
anti-war
demonstrations
One
attracted
about
1,000
people
Given
Brattleboro's
population
of
12,000
it
was
one
of
the
nation's
largest
demonstrations
per
capita
There
also
were
demonstrations
in
support
of
the
troops
some
of
which
coincided
with
war
protests
The
Gilberts
sent
Kyle
photos
of
the
former
Early
on
he
mailed
them
a
makeshift
postcard
on
a
piece
of
ripped
cardboard
with
Arabic
lettering
at
the
edges
I'm
OK
he
wrote
You
might
have
seen
the
82nd
Airborne
on
TV
Don't
worry
about
me
I'll
keep
my
head
lower
than
my
ass
I
should
be
home
by
Halloween
But
as
the
months
passed
the
fighting
never
really
stopped
Dates
for
coming
home
were
pushed
back
He
was
lonely
and
increasingly
he
was
scared
I
could
kinda
tell
just
from
his
voice
that
things
were
changing
Regina
says
You
just
know
your
own
son's
voice
Later
someone
in
Kyle's
unit
sent
the
Gilberts
photos
taken
during
the
summer
of
2003
In
them
he
looks
his
mother
thinks
like
a
different
person
thinner
older
He
doesn't
look
20
she
says
When
Kyle
called
home
July
18
Regina
greeted
him
by
his
baby
name
Hey
Bud-Bud
That
seemed
to
get
to
him
After
they'd
talked
for
a
while
he
said
Just
don't
forget
me
You're
my
only
baby
she
cried
That's
not
gonna
happen
Then
the
satellite
phone
connection
always
delayed
and
tenuous
was
cut
off
Hit
by
a
sniper
On
Aug
5
one
of
Kyle's
buddies
in
the
82nd
Airborne
called
his
mother
who
also
lived
in
Brattleboro
The
next
morning
the
mother
called
Regina
and
told
her
they're
doing
fine
There
had
been
no
U.S
military
deaths
in
Iraq
for
four
days
Commanders
had
begun
to
hope
that
their
campaign
against
guerrilla
leaders
had
worked
and
that
U.S
troops
could
begin
to
concentrate
more
on
building
goodwill
among
the
Iraqi
people
That
night
Kyle
was
riding
in
a
Humvee
at
the
front
of
a
patrol
convoy
in
west
Baghdad
when
a
sniper
opened
fire
One
shot
hit
a
soldier
in
the
back
of
the
vehicle
knocking
him
out
onto
the
road
Kyle
and
a
sergeant
leapt
out
to
get
him
There
was
more
sniper
fire
and
both
men
were
hit
In
Kyle's
pocket
was
his
last
will
and
testament
and
a
handwritten
note
It
began
Dear
Mom
and
Dad
By
the
time
you
read
this
I
will
have
died
for
my
country
Please
don't
be
sad
On
Aug
8
Regina
was
sitting
at
her
desk
at
a
food
wholesaler
reading
USA
TODAY
which
she'd
begun
to
buy
for
the
war
news
Two
soldiers
had
been
killed
Aug
6
in
Baghdad
One
was
identified
as
Staff
Sgt
Brian
Hellerman
of
C
Company
2nd
Battalion
235th
Parachute
Infantry
Regiment
of
the
82nd
Airborne
Division
from
Fort
Bragg
in
North
Carolina
Kyle's
unit
The
name
of
the
other
solider
had
not
been
released
the
article
said
I
don't
feel
so
good
about
this
she
told
a
co-worker
Then
the
phone
rang
It
was
Bob
An
Army
officer
was
in
town
looking
for
them
Bob
didn't
know
any
officers
so
he
had
an
idea
what
he
wanted
Kyle
Gilbert
was
the
first
person
from
Brattleboro
to
die
in
Iraq
On
Aug
12
five
months
after
he
went
to
Iraq
he
came
home
to
a
welcome
unlike
any
the
town
had
seen
in
many
years
When
the
hearse
got
off
Interstate
91
people
had
been
waiting
at
the
exit
for
hours
Unbidden
they
lined
the
route
into
town
often
four
and
five
deep
Some
followed
the
hearse
on
foot
toward
the
funeral
home
The
procession
moved
slowly
through
Brattleboro
past
Kyle's
high
school
the
hospital
where
he
was
born
the
neighborhood
where
he
grew
up
Past
the
alignment
shop
and
the
car
wash
where
he
earned
the
4,000
for
big
rims
and
tires
for
his
souped-up
red
1969
Chevelle
Everyone
was
struck
by
the
silence
broken
only
by
the
slow
pounding
of
a
single
bass
drum
Waiting
at
the
funeral
home
Regina
heard
the
drum
get
louder
and
louder
and
knew
her
son
was
coming
Sam
Haskins
a
local
Vietnam
veteran
wondered
how
members
of
the
82nd
Airborne
who
came
to
town
for
the
funeral
would
react
to
anti-war
demonstrators
A
sergeant
told
him
not
to
worry
We're
fighting
so
they
have
the
right
to
do
that
Honoring
sacrifice
On
Veterans
Day
2003
a
local
writer
named
Judy
Gorman
saw
President
Bush
laying
a
wreath
at
the
Tomb
of
the
Unknowns
at
Arlington
National
Cemetery
It
prompted
her
to
write
an
op-ed
column
for
the
Brattleboro
Reformer
in
which
she
argued
that
Bush
had
been
remarkably
reticent
in
honoring
the
sacrifices
made
by
the
known
soldiers
in
Iraq
Story
Memorial
efforts
across
the
U.S
Let's
do
it
for
him
she
wrote
Gilbert
was
Brattleboro's
hometown
hero
so
why
not
give
his
name
to
the
newly
reconstructed
bridge
that
carries
Main
Street
over
Whetstone
Brook
She
didn't
expect
anything
to
come
of
it
But
a
reader
sent
a
100
check
to
the
newspaper
Other
donations
followed
In
January
the
town
council
voted
to
name
the
bridge
for
Gilbert
Residents
many
of
them
moved
by
memories
of
his
homecoming
raised
more
than
10,000
for
a
memorial
at
the
bridge
Choice
of
words
As
devised
by
the
town
manager
the
Gilberts
and
a
group
of
veterans
the
design
called
for
a
granite
monument
4
feet
high
The
face
bore
the
likeness
of
an
American
eagle
with
a
scroll
in
its
talons
On
the
scroll
was
FREEDOM
IS
NOT
FREE
and
below
it
BRATTLEBORO
SUPPORTS
ALL
THE
BRAVE
MEN
AND
WOMEN
WHO
SERVED
OUR
NATION
OR
MADE
THE
SUPREME
SACRIFICE
DURING
OPERATION
IRAQI
FREEDOM
But
after
the
design
was
circulated
among
town
officials
Sam
Haskins
the
Vietnam
vet
got
a
call
from
Jerry
Remillard
the
town
manager
He
said
We
have
to
change
this
to
make
people
happy
Haskins
says
Some
people
considered
the
eagle
to
be
jingoistic
Freedom
isn't
free
to
be
a
pro-war
slogan
and
Operation
Iraqi
Freedom
to
be
Pentagon
news
web
sites
propaganda
Even
the
word
supports
was
seen
by
some
as
condoning
the
war
Pat
DeAngelo
a
council
member
threatened
to
disclaim
responsibility
for
the
memorial
unless
the
language
was
changed
This
was
supposed
to
be
an
apolitical
statement
she
told
the
Reformer
Operation
Iraqi
Freedom
definitely
is
not
Gorman
the
writer
who'd
started
it
all
called
the
wording
bellicose
Regina
Gilbert
was
stunned
Freedom
wasn't
free
Didn't
everyone
support
the
troops
if
not
the
war
She
wasn't
political
at
41
she'd
never
even
voted
They
said
they
didn't
want
a
war
memorial
but
we
weren't
promoting
a
war
Bob
says
But
the
Gilberts
agreed
to
change
the
wording
We
couldn't
let
people
forget
Kyle
Regina
says
We
kept
going
for
Kyle
The
bridge
was
named
on
a
cold
Veterans
Day
morning
last
month
The
memorial
reads
BRATTLEBORO
REMEMBERS
ALL
THE
BRAVE
MEN
AND
WOMEN
WHO
SERVED
OUR
COUNTRY
OR
MADE
THE
SUPREME
SACRIFICE
IN
IRAQ
Above
those
words
is
the
inscription
AS
KYLE
SAID
JUST
DON'T
FORGET
ME
Now
I
know
we'll
never
forget
him
Bob
Gilbert
told
a
crowd
of
several
hundred
and
I
think
you
won't
either
Five
anti-war
protesters
stood
silently
across
the
street
holding
signs
We
Mourn
All
Victims
of
War
and
Honor
Vets
by
Ending
the
War
One
protester
was
Bob
Bady
who
took
an
hour
off
from
work
to
be
there
He
felt
the
memorial's
presence
glorified
the
war
however
inadvertently
and
ignored
Iraqi
victims
We
did
something
that
needed
to
be
out
there
he
later
said
of
the
protest
I
don't
think
we
caused
a
whole
lot
of
discomfort
Pain
persists
Sixteen
months
after
Kyle's
death
the
Gilberts
have
not
been
able
to
bring
themselves
to
go
through
the
five
containers

Myanmar
continues

From

KUALA

Reuters
Myanmar
has
extended
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi's
detention
Malaysia's
foreign
minister
said
Monday
confirming
recent
reports
from
Yangon
that
the
junta
had
decided
to
keep
her
in
isolation
It
is
confirmed
Syed
Hamid
Albar
told
reporters
But
we
don't
even
know
if
there
is
an
end-date
They
only
say
they
have
not
released
her...(she
is
going
to
continue
to
be
placed
under
house
arrest

Suu

is

She

and
requiring

Her
National

said
last
Wednesday
that
Myanmar's
rulers
would
extend
Suu
Kyi's
isolation
until
at
least
Nov
27
next
year
There
had
been
no
official
word
from
Yangon
Syed
Hamid
said
Myanmar
should
heed
world
opinion
and
release
Suu
Kyi
to
help
national
reconciliation
and
boost
the
junta's
credibility
I
think
they
should
look
at
their
roadmap
so
that
it
has
got
credibility
and
it
is
believed
by
the
international
community
they
are
going
to
proceed
as
they
have
promised
he
said
I
think
it
should
include
finally
the
release
of
Aung

Suu

if
we
talk
about
democracy
he
said
Myanmar's
fellow
ASEAN
members
have
urged
Yangon
to
release
Suu
Kyi
whose
continued
detention
has
proved
an
embarrassment
to
the

internal

Washington

has
condemned
Syu

detention
and
imposed
sanctions
on
Myanmar
has
said
it
will
have
to
think
about
whether
to
deal
with
ASEAN
at
a
senior
level
when
Myanmar
chairs
the
group
in
2006
after
Malaysia's
turn
in

Despite

it

committed
to
moving
toward

In

The

the

my
attention
that
for
a
period
of
time
during

employment
required
tax
payments
and

had

Kerik
said
he
feared

that
would
only

as

unnecessary

AMSTERDAM
Netherlands
AP
A
hospital
in
the
Netherlands
the
first
nation
to
permit
euthanasia
recently
proposed
guidelines
for
mercy
killings
of
terminally
ill
newborns
and
then
made
a
startling
revelation
It
has
already
begun
carrying
out
such
procedures
which
include
administering
a
lethal
dose
of
sedatives
The
announcement
by
the
Groningen
Academic
Hospital
came
amid
a
growing
discussion
in
Holland
on
whether
to
legalize
euthanasia
on
people
incapable
of
deciding
for
themselves
whether
they
want
to
end
their
lives
a
prospect
viewed
with
horror
by
euthanasia
opponents
and
as
a
natural
evolution
by
advocates
In
August
the
main
Dutch
doctors
association
KNMG
urged
the
Health
Ministry
to
create
an
independent
board
to
review
euthanasia
cases
for
terminally
ill
people
with
no
free
will
including
children
the
severely
mentally
retarded
and
people
left
in
an
irreversible
coma
after
an
accident
The
Groningen
Protocol
as
the
hospital's
guidelines
have
come
to
be
known
would
create
a
legal
framework
for
permitting
doctors
to
actively
end
the
life
of
newborns
deemed
to
be
in
similar
pain
from
incurable
disease
or
extreme
deformities
The
guideline
says
euthanasia
is
acceptable
when
the
child's
medical
team
and
independent
doctors
agree
the
pain
cannot
be
eased
and
there
is
no
prospect
for
improvement
and
when
parents
think
it's
best
Examples
include
extremely
premature
births
where
children
suffer
brain
damage
from
bleeding
and
convulsions
and
diseases
where
a
child
could
only
survive
on
life
support
for
the
rest
of
its
life
such
as
severe
cases
of
spina
bifida
and
epidermosis
bullosa
a
rare
blistering
illness
The
hospital
revealed
last
month
it
carried
out
four
such
mercy
killings
in
2003
and
reported
all
cases
to
government
prosecutors
There
have
been
no
legal
proceedings
against
the
hospital
or
the
doctors

Funny
I
seem
to
vaguely
recall
a
man
several
decades

who
had
the

Spencerian
mindset
where
he
thought
the
Hellen
Kellers

Liberaces
and
Eli
Wiesels
of
the

shouldn't
have
the
right
to
pass
on
their
inferior

name

was
Ah

If
euthanasia
is
truly
legalized
as
it
appears
it
will
be/is
in
the
Netherlands
it
skips
about
8
steps
on
the
Scary
Scale
where
China
once
set
the
previous
record
with
its
1994
Maternal
and
Infant
Health
Care
Law
The
law
included
mandatory
pre-marital
screenings
for
genetic
diseases
of
a
serious
nature
and
relevant
mental
disease
Those
who
are
diagnosed
with
such
diseases
are
required
either
to
not
marry
or
to
agree
to
long
term
contraceptive
measures
or
to
submit
to
sterilization."1This
goes
way
beyond
determining
a
baby
is
an
inconvenience
at
this
point
in
a
woman's
life"--This
just
plain
determines
the
life
is
plain
worthless
Every
life
is
precious
as
it
is
a
gift
from
God--His
perfect
creation
no
matter
how
imperfect
we
deem
the
life
to
be
in
terms
of

A

the
world's
critically
endangered
tiger
population
from

conservationists
warned
Out
of
the
eight
sub-species
of
tiger
that
roamed
the
earth's
jungles
and
forests
60
years
ago
the
Bali

the

and
the

Tiger
populations
have
plunged
from
around
100,000
at
the
turn
of
the
last
century
to
between
5,700
and
7,000
today
most
in
isolated
pockets
stretching
from
India
to
southeastern
China
and
from
the
Russian
Far
East
to
Indonesia
But
those
remaining
face
a
multitude
of
threats
warned
S.C
Dey
secretary-general
of
the
Global
Tiger
Forum
on
the
opening
day
of
the
New
Delhi-headquartered
international
organization's
general
assembly
in
Hanoi
Increased
human-tiger
conflict
due
to
rising
human
population
shrinkage
and
degradation
of
tiger
habitat
and
declining
preybase
pose
a
serious
threat
to
the
survival
of
the
tiger
he
said
Poaching
a
lack
of
public
will
to
protect
the
animals
and
the
drive
towards
modernization
in
Asia's
developing
countries
compound
the
problem
Dey
added
The
decline
of
tiger
populations
last
century
was
primarily
the
result
of
culls
either
because
they
were
viewed
as
dangerous
animals
or
because
hunting
them
was
considered
a
noble
sport
by
colonial
and
indigenous
elite
Subsequently
commercial
trade
of
tiger
skin
and
other
parts
of
the
cat
for
alleged
medicinal
purposes
have
become
a
major
threat
to
their
existence
The
majority
of
these
animals
are
sought
to
meet
the
demands
of
a
continuing
illegal
wildlife
trade
according
to
the
WWF
The
Bengal
Sumatran
Indochinese
and
South
China
sub-species
were
placed
on
the
most
endangered
appendix
1
of
the
Convention
on
International
Trade
in
Endangered
Species
CITES
in
1975
The
Siberian
tiger
was
listed
in
1987
Preventing
these
sub-species
from
becoming
extinct
requires
significant
financial
input
massive
public
education
and
awareness
campaigns
and
the
concerted
unified
efforts
of
conservationists
and
governments
Dey
said
Currently
manpower
and
funds
assigned
to
protect
tiger
populations
were
inadequate
in
many
tiger-range
countries
while
conservationists
are
very
often
branded
as
anti-development
and
face
local
resentment
he
added
Dey
stressed
however
that
the
world
has
a
duty
to
protect
the
cats
who
as
top
predators
keep
populations
of
other
wild
animals
in
check
thereby
maintaining
the
balance
between
herbivores
and
the
vegetation
upon
which
they
feed
The
tiger
occupies
the
apex
of
one
such
eco-system
pyramid
and
our
effort
to
save
the
tiger
is
aimed
at
deferring
ecological
disaster
he
said
Strategies
have
been
broadly
worked
out
What
is
required
is
to
refine
and
implement
them
so
that
the
tiger
continues
as
a
dynamic
asset
of
nature
not
only
in
years
to
follow
but
in
centuries
and
the
millenium
to
come

WASHINGTON
The

legal

ties
to
the
group
because
of
its

A

passed
by

391-3
vote
recognized
the
3.2
million-member
Boy
Scouts
for
its

efforts
But
the

was
what
the

Judiciary
Committee
chairman
Rep
James
Sensenbrenner
R-Wis
said
were
the
strident
legal
attacks
on

group
The
Pentagon
agreed
last
week
to
tell
U.S
military
bases
around
the
world
not
to
directly
sponsor
Boy
Scout
troops
The
warning
resulted
from
legal
challenges
to
government
relations
with
a
group
that
bans
openly
gay
leaders
and
compels
members
to
swear
an
oath
of
duty
to
God
The
American
Civil

Union
and
others
say
that
direct
government
sponsorship
of
such
a
program
amounts
to
discrimination

I'm
sure
at

two
or
three
Democrats
had
to

their

to

requesting

these

simply
cannot
accept
the

that
George

Can

Conyers
predicted
his

efforts
will
probably
lead
to

Keep
in
mind
that
after
the

we
all
heard
the
liberal

of
we

It
should
be

by

that

have
no

that
manufactured
many
of

claiming
that
the

nothing

I

A

But
history
teaches

that

The

is
already
widespread

the
press
foreign

is
more

Persecution
Growing
Fast
in
Africa
By
Jim
Jacobson
President
of
Christian
Freedom
International
In
the
early
90s
Muslims
comprised
between
1
percent
and
2
percent
of
the
population
in
Rwanda
Today
that
figure
is
5
percent
census
returns
show
The
number
of
mosques
has
risen
to
570
from
220
In
Uganda
Islam
is
growing
so
fast
Every

we
are
getting
people
converting
Sheik
Harun
Sengooba
of
the
Union
of
Muslim
Councils
for
East
Central
and
Southern
Africa
said
to
Reuters
In
South
Africa
Islam
is
growing
among
blacks
in
a
country
where
80
percent
of
the
45
million
people
are
Christian
Currently
less
than
2
percent
of
South
Africans
or
about
650,000
people
are
Muslim
But
the
semi-autonomous
Human
Sciences
Research
Council
HSRC
estimates
74,700
Africans
are
Muslim
from
fewer
than
12,000
in
1991
Islamic
non-governmental
groups
in
Africa
many
backed
by
Gulf
oil
cash
grew
from
138
in
1980
to
891
in
2000
more
than
twice
the
rate
of
increase
in
the
total
number
of
Africa's
NGOs
in
the
period
Along
with
the
growth
of
Islam
naturally
religious
persecution
targeting
Christians
is
on
the
increase
as
well
For
example
in
Nigeria
Africa's
most
populous
country
religious
violence
targeting
Christians
has
killed
at
least
5,000
since
2000
when
12
northern
states
predominantly
inhabited
by
Muslims
established
Islamic
Sharia
law
And
in
Sudan
since
1983
an
estimated
2
million
persons
have
been
killed
approximately
4
million
have
been
displaced
internally
as
a
result
of
fighting
between
the
Islamic
north
and
mostly
Christian
south
I
can't
believe
the
numbers
A
jump
from
12k
to
over
74k
Muslims
in
just
over
13
years
Just
what
exactly
is
the
appeal
of
Islam
in
the
poorest
regions
of
Africa
I've
yet
to
find
any
shred
of
hope
in
the
religion
of
peace
I
can't
remember
the
last
time
I
heard
about
a
MUSLIM
charitable

flying
in
tons
of
food

and
medical

to

The
History
of
Veterans
Day
When
the
end
came
to
World
War
I
November
11
1919
was
set
aside
to
commemorate
the
sacrifices
made
by
American
soldiers
to
gain
a
lasting
peace
for
the
world
Called
Armistice
Day
soldiers
who
survived
the
war
marched
in
parades
through
their
home
towns
Dignitaries
and
veterans
made
speeches
and
held
ceremonies
of
thanks
for
the
peace
that
had
been
won
Had
WWI
been
the
war
to
end
all
wars
we
would
probably
still
observe
Armistice
Day
today
After
WWII
Armistice
Day
continued
to
be
observed
but
Americans
realized
that
there
was
a
need
to
recognize
those
who
had
made
sacrifices
in
other
conflicts
In
1954
President
Eisenhower
signed
a
bill
proclaiming
November
11
as
Veterans
Day
and
called
upon
Americans
everywhere
to
rededicate
themselves
to
the
cause
of
peace
He
issued
a
Presidential
Order
directing
the
head
of
the
Veterans
Administration
now
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
to
form
a
Veterans
Day
National
Committee
to
organize
and
oversee
the
national
observance
of
Veterans
Day
November
11
was
designated
as
Veterans
Day
to
honor
veterans
of
all
U.S
wars
In
1971
President
Nixon
declared
it
a
federal
holiday
on
the
second
Monday
in
November
but
it
became
apparent
that
November
11
was
too
historically
significant
to
bypass
so
in
1978
Congress
formally
returned
the
observance
of
Veterans
Day
to
the
customary
date
of
November
11

the
loop
As
the
Associated
Press
reports
John
Edwards
is
hardly
going
away
He's
positioned
himself
for
a
full-out
presidential
run
in
2008
a
campaign
that
in
a
way
he's
already
begun
That's
despite
his
liabilities
He's
leaving
the
Senate
after
a
single
term
he
has
little
foreign
policy
experience
he
couldn't
deliver
his
own
state
or
any
other
in
the
South
for
Kerry
despite
boasting
that
I
will
beat
George
Bush
in
my
backyard
But
he
now
has
the
experience
and
public
exposure
of
a
national
campaign
Well
at
least
they
were
kind
enough
to
offer
one
piece
of
encouragement
Word
on
the
street
is
even
Howard
Yeeaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgggggh
Dean
may
be
up
for
the
top
spot
as
the
head
of
the
DNC...should
Queen
Hillary
permit
it
One
piece
of
advice
I
can
give
the
Democratic
faithful
is
to
first
learn
to
tell
the
difference
between
an
undesirable
outcome
of
a
hardfought
and
legitimate
election
and
the
barbaric
killing
of
3,000
men
women
and
children
who
merely
inhabited
a
building
Perhaps
it
was/(still
is
just
too
difficult
for
them
to
swallow
the
reality
of
a
better
tomorrow
Dubya
didn't
just
win
where
he
won
He
mostly
won
where
he
lost
too
Even
Dirty
Jersey
voted
strongly
for
Bush
Travis
argues
Bush
successfully
won
the
election
trifecta
and
thus
a
true
mandate
from
the
people
Steve
via
Sharon
Hughes
got
all
mathematical
and
shizzle
on
me
while
I
wasn't
looking
Eric
asks
Michael
Moore
when
the
last
time
he
saw
his
penis
was
while
the
wonderful
Michelle

his
artful
attack
into
something
Moore
beautiful
Is
it
possible
to
use
the
words
beautiful
and
Moore
in
the
same
sentence
Patrick

while
Liberal
Larry

Frank

P.S
Oh

to

You'll
be
so
proud
of
me

test
P.P.S
Get

N.J
Lifelong
Republican
Richard
Bonnet
pays
attention
to
politics
so
when
he
found
a
message
on
his
answering
machine
from
Norman
Schwarzkopf
saying
he
was
voting
for
John
Kerry
this
year
he
was
momentarily
stunned
I
thought
I
saw
Bush
down
in
Florida
with
Schwarzkopf
standing
on
the
stage
next
to
him
Bonnet
69
of
Howell
Township
said
Monday
So
I
called
up
the
Monmouth
County
Republican
headquarters
and
they
said
he
was
a
Bush
supporter
On
Sunday
the
retired
general
gave
Bush
a
strong
endorsement
in
Tampa
Fla
Schwarzkopf's
spokeswoman
Lynn
Williams
said
Monday
that
the
recorded
message
was
totally
fake
The
taped
message
begins
with
a
man
identifying
himself
as
Schwarzkopf
In
2000
I
voted
for
George
W
Bush
but
this
year
I'm
voting
for
John
Kerry
The
man
goes
on
to
say
that
Bush
took
his
eye
off
the
ball
when
it
came
to
finding
the
people
responsible
for
the
Sept
11
attacks
which
killed
nearly
700
New
Jersey
residents
John
Kerry
has
a
real
plan
to
make
our
military
stronger
and
to
go
after
terrorists
wherever
they
hide
the
man
says
on
the
tape
We
need
a
vote
for

vote
for
John
Kerry
A
voice
then
says
the
message
was
paid
for
by
the
Democratic
National
Committee
A
call
to
the
DNC
was
not
immediately
returned
Monday
Brian
Nelson
spokesman
for
the
New
Jersey
Republican
State
Committee
called
the
tape
dirty
politics
and
said
Republicans
were
trying
to
find
out
who
was
behind
it
Bonnet
said
he
was
disgusted
by
the
tape
Schwarzkopf
is
such
a
great
American
and
a
great
general
and
this
defames
him
said

A
message
from
President
George
W
Bush
Tomorrow
Americans
will
choose
who
will
lead
our
country
during
a
time
of
war
and
economic
opportunity
And
the
choice
on
Tuesday
comes
down
to
a
few
issues
of
great
consequence
The
first
choice
is
the
most
important
because
all
our
progress
depends
on
our
safety
Since
September
the
11th
2001
I
have
led
a
relentless
campaign
against
the
terrorists
We
have
strengthened
homeland
security
We
removed
terror
regimes
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
We
are
on
the
offensive
around
the
world
because
the
best
way
to
prevent
future
attacks
is
to
go
after
the
enemy
My
opponent
has
a
different
view
Senator
Kerry
says
September
the
11th
didn't
change
him
much
and
his
policies
make
that
clear
He
says
the
war
on
terror
is
primarily
an
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
operation
He
has
proposed
what
he
calls
a
global
test
that
would
give
foreign
governments
a
veto
over
American
security
decisions
And
when
our
troops
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
needed
funding
for
body
armor
and
bullets
Senator
Kerry
voted
against
it
The
direction
of
the
war
on
terror
is
at
stake
in
the
election
of
2004
And
when
you
go
to
the
polls
on
Tuesday
remember
this
I
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
defend
America
and
prevail
in
the
war
on
terror
and
I
will
always
support
the
men
and
women
who
do
the
fighting
The
second
choice
in
this
election
concerns
your
family
budget
As
a
candidate
I
pledged
to
lower
taxes
for
families
and
I
have
kept
my
word
We
doubled
the
child
tax
credit
reduced
the
marriage
penalty
and
dropped
the
lowest
tax
bracket
to
10
percent
Now
working
families
keep
more
of
their
paychecks
and
America's
economy
is
growing
faster
than
any
other
among
major
industrialized
nations
My
opponent
voted
against
all
our
tax
relief
for
working
families
His
votes
would
have
squeezed
about
2,000
more
in
taxes
from
the
average
middle-class
family
Now
Senator
Kerry
is
promising
to
increase
federal
spending
by
more
than
2.2
trillion
And
to
pay
for
all
that
new
spending
he
would
have
to
raise
taxes
on
American
families
I
will
keep
your
taxes
low
because
I
know
it's
not
the
government's
money
it's
your
family's
money
The
third
choice
in
this
election
involves
your
quality
of
life
As
President
I
signed
historic
education
reforms
to
bring
high
standards
to
the
classroom
and
make
schools
accountable
to
parents
and
our
children
are
making
progress
in
reading
and
math
We've
strengthened
Medicare
created
health
savings
accounts
and
expanded
community
health
centers
to
help
more
Americans
get
health
care
I'm
proposing
a
series
of
practical
reforms
to
make
health
care
more
affordable
and
accessible
by
expanding
health
savings
accounts
allowing
association
health
plans
and
protecting
patients
and
doctors
from
junk
and
frivolous
lawsuits
My
opponent
has
a
different
approach
Senator
Kerry
voted
for
the
No
Child
Left
Behind
Act
but
he
has
pledged
to
weaken
the
accountability
standards
He's
voted
10
times
against
medical
liability
reform
And
now
he's
proposing
a
big-government
health
care
plan
that
would
do
nothing
about
rising
health
costs
and
would
cause
millions
of
Americans
to
lose
their
private
health
insurance
and
end
up
on
government
programs
Finally
this
election
presents
a
choice
on
the
values
that
keep
our
families
strong
I
believe
marriage
is
a
sacred
commitment
and
I
will
always
defend
it
I
will
continue
to
appoint
judges
who
strictly
interpret
the
law
And
I
will
keep
working
to
move
this
good-hearted
nation
toward
a
culture
of
life
On
these
issues
my
opponent
and
I
are
miles
apart
Senator
Kerry
was
part
of
an
out-of-the-mainstream
minority
that
voted
against
the
Defense
of
Marriage
Act
He
believes
there
ought
to
be
a
liberal
litmus
test
for
judicial
appointments
He
voted
against
banning
the
brutal
practice
of
partial
birth
abortion
I
believe
that
reasonable
people
can
find
common
ground
on
difficult
issues
and
I
will
continue
reaching
out
and
bringing
Americans
together
to
protect
our
deepest-held
values
All
of
these
choices
make
this
one
of
the
most
important
elections
in
our
history
These
past
four
years
you
have
seen
how
I
do
my
job
Even
when
you
might
not
agree
with
me
you
know
where
I
stand
what
I
believe
and
what
I
intend
to
do
Soon
the
decision
will
be
in
your
hands
And
however
you
decide
I
urge
you
to
get
out
and
vote
on
Tuesday

The
tape
of
Osama

that
was
aired
on
Al-Jazeera(1
on
Friday
October
29th
included
a
specific
threat
to
each
U.S

designed
to
influence
the
outcome
of
the
upcoming
election
against
George

The
U.S

in

mistranslated
the
words
ay
wilaya
which
means
each
U.S

to
mean
a
country
or
nation
other
than
the
U.S
while
in
fact
the
threat
was
directed
specifically
at
each
individual
U.S
state
This
suggests
some
knowledge
by
bin

of
the
U.S
electoral
college
system
In
a
section
of
his
speech
in
which
he
harshly
criticized
George

bin

stated
Any

It's

amputees

and
back

Rozelle
said
prior
to
the
race
start
adding
he
had
no
doubts
that
each
would
make
it
across
the
finish
line
The
same
steely
mettle
that
helped
steer
them
off
the
battlefield
after
suffering
horrific
injuries
will
carry
them
through
the
10-mile
route
Rozelle
said
It's
guts
nothing
but
guts
Some
may
walk
but
that's
okay
What
matters
is
that
they
will
finish
he
said
Rozelle
who
served
as
team
captain
has
been
relentless
in
not
letting
his
injury
prevent
him
from
being
the
best
Soldier
he
can
be
He
commanded
a
cavalry
troop
from
Fort
Carson
in
Iraq
after
a
medical
board
cleared
him
to
remain
on
active
duty
earlier
this
year
he
took
command
of
a
3rd
Armored
Cavalry
Regiment
headquarters
troop
He's
been
alerted
that
he'll
be
deployed
again
to

next
year
An

skier
Rozelle
hit
the
slopes
again
in

for
a
Disabled

ski
clinic
In
April
he
participated
in
the
National
Disabled
Veterans
Winter
Sports
Clinic
put
on
by
the
Veterans

and
Disabled
American

With
his

leg
he
completed
a
June
Hope
Possibility
5-Miler
in
Central
Park
with
several
other
Soldiers
and
service
members
from
Walter
Reed
And
just
a
couple
weeks
ago
he
finished
a
marathon
a
one-mile
swim
25
miles
on
a
bike
and
a
six-mile
run
He
plans
on
running
in
the
New

City
marathon
next
month
More
than
13,000
runners
trekked
across
the
Army
Ten-Miler
finish
line
in
wet
cold
weather
Rozelle
predicted
a
10-minute
mile
pace
and
came
in
just
under
that
at
one
hour
38
minutes
not
far
behind
McCaffrey
and
Payton
both
of
whom
ran
without
their
prosthetic
arms
McCaffrey
finished
in
1:34
Payton
1:35
Ramos
who
also
left
his
prosthetic
arm
behind
came
in
with
a
time
of
2:04
I
finished
that's
all
I
wanted
to
do
said
Ramos
who
lost
his
left
hand
to
a
rocket-propelled
grenade
while
patrolling
with
Marines
near
Fallujah
a
couple
of
months
ago
The
race
was
even
tougher
for
Lasko
and
Pizzifred
who
picked
up
their
running
prosthetics
two
days
before
the
race
With
no
time
to
try
them
out
and
get
any
needed
adjustments
they
ran
cold
turkey
Sherer
ran
with
a
backpack
carrying
the
pair's
prosthetic
walking
legs
backups
in
case
the
running
legs
caused
too
much
pain
He
buddied
up
with
Pizzifred
while
Naranjo
ran
with
Lasko
Naranjo
came
across
the
finish
line
carrying
Lasko's
prosthetic
yelling
encouragement
for
the
last
100
yards
or
so
to
Lasko
who
pushed
himself
into
a
sprint
for
a
2:18
finish
Despite
some
pre-race
worries
about
getting
traction
on
the
wet
pavement
Lasko
said
he
didn't
experience
any
major
problem
along
the
course
I
was
a
little
sore
he
admitted
smiling
The
longest
distance
he
had
run
on
a
prosthetic
before
the
Ten-Miler
was
five
miles
he
added
Like
Rozelle
Lasko
participated
in
the
Hope
Possibility
run
in
Central
Park
several
months
ago
Naranjo
had
nothing
but
praise
for
his
run
buddy
The
new
prosthetic
rubbed
Lasko
in
the
wrong
ways
quite
a
bit
through
the
run
Naranjo
said
Here's
a
guy
who
some
months
ago
was
laying
in
a
hospital
bed
wondering
if
he'd
ever
be
able
to
walk
again
Naranjo
said
And
look
at
what
he
just
did
He's
my
hero
These
guys
are
what
make
me
get
up
in
the
morning
and
do
what
I
have
to
do
I
see
people
everyday
overcoming
much
greater
challenges
that
I
have
Sherer
was

Sir
Jim
Price
The
other
day
my
nine-year-old
son
wanted
to
know
why
we
were
at
war
My
husband
looked
at
our
son
and
then
looked
at
me
My
husband
and
I
were
in
the
Army
during
the
Gulf
War
and
we
would
be
honored
to
serve
and
defend
our
Country
again
today
I
knew
that
my
husband
would
give
him
a
good
explanation
My
husband
thought
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
told
my
son
to
go
stand
in
our
front
living
room
window
He
said
Son
stand
there
and
tell
me
what
you
see
I
see
trees
and
cars
and
our
neighbors
houses
he
replied
OK
now
I
want
you
to
pretend
that
our
house
and
our
yard
is
the
United
States
of
America
and
you
are
President
Bush
Our
son
giggled
and
said
OK
Now
son
I
want
you
to
look
out
the
window
and
pretend
that
every
house
and
yard
on
this
block
is
a
different
country
my
husband
said
OK
Dad
I'm
pretending
Now
I
want
you
to
stand
there
and
look
out
the
window
and
pretend
you
see
Saddam
come
out
of
his
house
with
his
wife
he
has
her
by
the
hair
and
is
hitting
her
You
see
her
bleeding
and
crying
He
hits
her
in
the
face
he
throws
her
on
the
ground
then
he
starts
to
kick
her
to
death
Their
children
run
out
and
are
afraid
to
stop
him
they
are
screaming
and
crying
they
are
watching
this
but
do
nothing
because
they
are
kids
and
they
are
afraid
of
their
father
You
see
all
of
this
son....what
do
you
do
Dad
What
would
you
do
son
I'd
call
the
police
Dad
OK
Pretend
that
the
police
are
the
United
Nations
and
they
take
your
call
listen
to
what
you
know
and
saw
but
they
refuse
to
help
What
do
you
do
then
son
Dad...but
the
police
are
supposed
to
help
My
son
starts
to
whine
They
don't
want
to
son
because
they
say
that
it
is
not
their
place
or
your
place
to
get
involved
and
that
we
should
all
stay
out
of
it
my
husband
says
But
Dad...he
killed
her
my
son
exclaims
I
know
he
did...but
the
police
tell
you
to
stay
out
of
it
Now
I
want
you
to
look
out
that
window
and
pretend
you
see
our
neighbor
who
you're
pretending
is
Saddam
turn
around
and
do
the
same
thing
to
his
own
children
Daddy...he
kills
them
Yes
son
he
does
What
do
you
do
Well
if
the
police
don't
want
to
help
I
will
go
and
ask
my
next
door
neighbor
to
help
me
stop
him
our
son
says
Son
your
next
door
neighbor
sees
what
is
happening
but
he
refuses
to
get
involved
as
well
He'll
not
help
you
my
husband
says
But
Dad
I
NEED
help
I
can't
stop
him
by
myself
WHAT
DO
YOU
DO
SON
Our
son
starts
to
cry
OK
no
one
wants
to
help
you
the
man
across
the
street
saw
you
ask
for
help
and
saw
that
no
one
would
help
you
stop
him
He
stands
taller
and
puffs
out
his
chest
Guess
what
he
does
next
son
What
Daddy
Watching
you
in
the
window
he
walks
over
to
the
old
lady's
house
breaks
down
her
door
and
drags
her
out
He
sets
her
house
on
fire
and
then
he...he
kills
her
He
does
this
while
he
laughs
at
you
and
her
WHAT
DO
YOU
DO
Daddy
WHAT
DO
YOU
DO
Our
son
is
crying
and
he
looks
down
and
he
whispers
I'd
close
the
blinds
Daddy
My
husband
looks
at
our
son
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
asks
him..."Why
Because
Daddy.....the
police
are
supposed
to
help
people
who
needs
them...and
they
won't
help
You
always
say
that
neighbors
are
supposed
to
HELP
neighbors
but
they
won't
help
either...they
won't
help
me
stop
him...I'm
afraid....I
can't
do
it
by
myself
Daddy.....I
can't
look
out
my
window
and
just
watch
him
do
all
these
terrible
things
and
and
do
nothing...so....I'm
just
going
to
close
the
blinds
so
I
can't
see
what
he's
doing........and
I'm
going
to
pretend
that
it
is
not
happening
I
start
to
cry
My
husband
looks
at
our
nine
year
old
son
standing
in
the
window
looking
pitiful
and
ashamed
at
his
answers
to
my
husband's
questions
and
he
says..."Son
Yes
Daddy
Open
the
blinds
son
because
that
evil
man
now
he's
at
our
front
door..."WHAT
WILL
YOU
DO
NOW
My
son
looks
at
his
father
anger
and
defiance
in
his
eyes
He
balls
up
his
tiny
fists
and
looks
his
father
square
in
the
eyes
without
hesitation
he
says
I'LL
DEFEND
MY
FAMILY
DAD
I'M
NOT
GONNA
LET
HIM
HURT
MOMMY
OR
MY
SISTER
DAD
I'M
GONNA

DAD
I'M
GONNA
FIGHT

I
see
a
tear
roll
down
my
husband's
cheek
and
he
grabs
our
son
to
his
chest
and
hugs
him
tight
and
says
It's
too
late
to
fight
him
he's
too
strong
and
he's
already
at
YOUR
front
door
son.....you
should
have
stopped
him
BEFORE
he
killed
his
wife
and
his
children
and
the
old
lady
across
the
way
You
have
to
do
what's
right
even
if
you
have
to
do
it
alone
before
it's
too
late

Curt

a
surprise
appearance
Monday
morning
with

to

have
everything
they

I'm
so

my

A
teacher
asked
the

what
their
fathers
did
for
a
living
All
typical
answers
came
up-fireman
policeman
doctor
etc
David
was
quiet
so
the
teacher
asked
him
about
his
father
My
father's
an
exotic
dancer
in
a
gay
cabaret
and
takes
off
all
his
clothes
in
front
of
other
men
and
they
put
money
in
his
underwear
Sometimes
if
the
offer
is
really
good
he
will
go
home
with
some
guy
and
make
love
with
him
for
money
The
teacher
obviously
shaken
by
his
statement
hurriedly
set
the
other
children
to
work
and
took
David
aside
to
ask
him
Is
that
true
about
your

No

File

under

A
group
of
talk-radio
listeners
in
Montana
burned
a
United
Nations
flag
to
protest
a
ceremony
at
the
state's
Capitol
honoring
the
global
body
On
Friday
KGEZ
radio
host
John
Stokes
in
Kalispell
Mont
got
wind
of
a
planned
ceremony
that
afternoon
at
the
state
Capitol
in
Helena
to
honor
the
U.N
on
United
Nations
Day
though
Sunday
was
actually
U.N
Day
Stokes
tells
WorldNetDaily
the
ceremony
included
members
of
the
Montana
National
Guard
carrying
and
presenting
a
U.N
flag
that
was
to
be
hoisted
over
the
building
Needless
to
say
our
listeners
and
I
became
immediately
outraged
Stokes
said
It
was
suggested
by
a
listener
to
demonstrate
our
outrage
A
call
to
patriots
went
out
over
the
air
At
1
p.m
the
time
the
Capitol
ceremony
was
to
take
place
over
30
protesters
gathered
at
Stokes
radio
station
for
the
flag
burning
Stokes
says
the
crowd
included
mothers
children
seniors
and
handicapped
citizens
We
began
with
the
Star
Spangled
Banner
blaring
across
the
airways
saluting
the
U.S
flag
flying
high
above
the
station
followed
by
the
Pledge
of
Allegiance
and
a
very
appropriate
prayer
for
our
nation
our
Constitution
and
the
Republic
Stokes
explained
Then
the
volunteers
provided
the
pole
and
gas
and
I
provided
the
despicable
U.N
flag
The
crowd
shouted
out
a
verbal
countdown
before
the
flag
was
torched
Said
Stokes
Whoosh
It
was
completely
gone
in
seconds
I
hope
it
was
an
omen

Let
me
ask
you
the
question
about--this
is
going
to
cause
some
trouble
with
people--but
as
an
historian
now
and
studying
the
Revolutionary
War
as
it
was
fought
out
in
the
South
in
those
last
years
of
the
War
insurgency
against
a
powerful
British
force
do
you
see
any
parallels
between
the
fighting
that
we
did
on
our
side
and
the
fighting
that
is
going
on
in
Iraq
today
CARTER
Well
one
parallel
is
that
the
Revolutionary
War
more
than
any
other
war
up
until
recently
has
been
the
most
bloody
war
we've
fought
I
think
another
parallel
is
that
in
some
ways
the
Revolutionary
War
could
have
been
avoided
It
was
an
unnecessary
war

pay

lowers

In
other
words
Kerry
wants
to
implement
his
own
version
of
HillaryCare
Talk
about
taking
a
big
chunk
out
of
Hillary's
2008
platform
Bush's
response
says
it
best
And
finally
he
said
he's
going
to
have
a
novel
health
care
plan
You
know
what
it
is
The
federal
government
is
going
to
run
it
It's
the
largest
increase
in
federal
government
health
care
ever
And
it
fits
with
his
philosophy
That's
why
I
told
you
about
the
award
he
won
from
the
National
Journal
That's
what
liberals
do
They
create
government-sponsored
health
care
Maybe
you
think
that
makes
sense
I
don't
Government-sponsored
health
care
would
lead
to
rationing
It
would
ruin
the
quality
of
health
care
in
America
Kerry
responded
by
telling
Americans
where
they
can
stick
it
if
they
don't
like
his
plan
Let
me
begin
by
saying
that
my
health-care
plan
is
not
what
the
president
described
It
is
not
a
government
takeover
You
have
choice
Choose
your
doctor
choose
your
plan
The
government
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
In
fact
it
doesn't
ask
you
to
do
anything
if
you
don't
want
to
take
it
you
don't
have
to
If
you
like
your
high
premiums
you
keep
them
That's
the
way
we
leave
it
I'd
sure
like
to
know
where
he's
going
to
get
the
revenue
to
pay
for
this
federal
fund
Hopefully
once
he
figures
out
how
to
work
out
the
budget
in
order
to
allocate
the
funding
he'll
put
it
in
a
lockbox--just
to
be
safe

A
POEM
TO
FRANCE
By
Don
Fichthorn
Major
USMC
Retired
Eleven
thousand
soldiers
Lay
beneath
the
dirt
and
stone
All
buried
on
a
distant
land
So
far
away
from
home
For
just
a
strip
of
dismal
beach
They
paid
a
hero's
price
To
save
a
foreign
nation
They
all
made
the
sacrifice
And
now
the
shores
of
Normandy
Are
lined
with
blocks
of
white
Americans
who
didn't
turn
From
someone
else's
plight
Eleven
thousand
reasons
For
the
French
to
take
our
side
But
in
the
moment
of
our
need
They
chose
to
run
and
hide
Chirac
said
every
war
means
loss
Perhaps
for
France
that's
true
For
they've
lost
every
battle
Since
the
days
of
Waterloo
Without
a
soldier
worth
a
damn
To
be
found
within
the
region
The
French
became
the
only
land
to
need
a
Foreign
Legion
You
French
all
say
we're
arrogant
Well
hell
we've
earned
the
right
We
saved
your
sorry
nation
When
you
lacked
the
guts
to
fight
But
now
you've
made
a
big
mistake
And
one
that
you'll
regret
You
took
sides
with
our
enemies
And
that
we
won't
forget
It
wasn't
just
our
citizens
You
spit
on
when
you
turned
But
every
one
of
yours
Who
fell
the
day
the
towers
burned
You
spit
upon
our
soldiers
On
our
pilots
and
Marines
And
now
you'll
get
a
little
sense
Of
just
what
payback
means
So
keep
your
Paris
fashions
And
your
wine
and
your
champagne
And
find
some
other
market
That
will
buy
your
airplanes
And
try
to
find
somebody
else
To
wear
your
French
cologne
For
you're
about
to
find
out
what
it
means
to
stand
alone
You
see
you
need
us
far
more
Than
we
ever
needed
you
America
has
better
friends
Who
know
how
to
be
true
I'd
rather
stand
with
warriors
Who
have
the
will
and
might
Than
huddle
in
the
dark
With
those
whose
only
flag
is
white
I'll
take
the
Brits
the
Aussies
The
Israelis
and
the
rest
For
when
it
comes
to
valor
We
have
seen
that
they're
the
best
We'll
count
on
one
another
As
we
face
a
moment
dire
While
you
sit
on
the
sideline
With
a
sign
friendship
for
hire
We'll
win
this
war
without
you
And
we'll
total
up
the
cost
And
take
it
from
your
foreign
aid
And
then
you'll
feel
the
loss
And
when
your
nation
starts
to
fall
Well
Frenchie
you
can
spare
us
Just
call
the
Germans
for
a
hand
They
know
the
way
to

The
Iraqi
Threat
A
Retrospective
From
Blogs
for
Bush
The
question
was
never
if
Saddam
Hussein
posed
a
threat
everyone
agreed
he
did
The
question
was
who
was
going
to
do
something
about
it
One
way
or
the
other
we
are
determined
to
deny
Iraq
the
capacity
to
develop
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
the
missiles
to
deliver
them
That
is
our
bottom
line
President
Clinton
Feb

1998
If
Saddam
rejects
peace
and
we
have
to
use
force
our
purpose
is
clear...We
want
to
seriously
diminish
the
threat
posed
by
Iraq's
weapons
of

destruction
program

Iraq
is
a
long

what

matters

For
the
risks
that
the
leaders

use
nuclear

against

He

is

and
will
likely
have
nuclear
weapons
within
the

Rep.Henry

Oct

In
the
four
years
since
the

left
intelligence
reports
show
that
Saddam
Hussein
has
worked
to
rebuild
his
chemical
and
biological

stock
his
missile
delivery
capability
and
his
nuclear
program
He
has
also
given
aid
comfort
and
sanctuary
to
terrorists
including
al

members
It
is
clear
however
that
if
left
unchecked
Saddam
Hussein
will
continue
to
increase
his
capacity
to
wage
biological
and
chemical
warfare
and
will
keep
trying
to
develop
nuclear
weapons

We
are
in
possession
of
what
I
think
to
be
compelling
evidence
that
Saddam
Hussein
has
and
has
had
for
a
number
of
years
a
developing
capacity
for
the
production
and
storage
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
Sen

Without
question
we
need
to
disarm
Saddam
Hussein
He
is
a
brutal
murderous
dictator
leading
an
oppressive
regime
He
presents
a
particularly
grievous
threat
because
he
is
so
consistently
prone
to
miscalculation
And
now
he
is
miscalculating
America's
response
to
his
continued
deceit
and
his
consistent
grasp
for
weapons
of
mass
destruction
So
the
threat
of
Saddam
Hussein
with
weapons
of
mass
destruction
is
real

A
confession

explanation
aw
heck
a
blanket
utility
post
in

I
have
never
been
a
fan
of
Catholics
Catholics
Catholicism
the
Pope
the
Vatican
Saints
in
the
Catholic
usage
confession
Hail
Marys

works-oriented
salvation
If
it's
Catholic
I
can't
stand
it
I
have
simply
grown
up
with
a
mighty
distrustful
perception
of
Catholicism
Have
3/5
of
all
the
women
I've
dated
since
high
school
been
Catholic
Yep
Did
I
go
to
a
Catholic
high
school
for
the
last
3
years
of
my
career
Yep
So
go
figure
However
recent
developments
ie
my
last
two
posts
and
Eric's
scathing
response
have
brought
me
to
a
realization
I
need
to
reconcile
the
love
of
Christ
that
dwells
in
my
heart
with
the
experiences
and
intellectual/spiritual
differences
with
Catholicism
I
hold
in
my
mind.I
have
only
recently
become
a
Christian
this
past
December
to
be
exact
although
I
have
been
raised
with
a
Christian
principled
upbringing
by
my
faithful
mother
My
youth
both
in
biological
years
and
in
terms
of
my
Christian
maturity
can
at
least
partly
be
to
blame
for
un-Christlike
commentary
of
my
last
two
posts
I
have
deleted
them
for
obvious
reasons
though
you
can
find
the
object
of
my
shame
at
Eric's
blog
Traffic
to
his
site
is
but
an
added
component
to
my
apology
My
sometimes
tongue-in-cheek
more
often
times
vicious
satirical
and
sarcastic
styles
of
humor
have
certainly
gotten
the
best
of
me
over
the
years
These
last
two
posts
are
no
exception
I
will
not
delve
deeply
into
my
theological
differences
with
Catholics
However
I
will
partially
explain
where
the
motivation
for
the
jabs
at
the
pope
originated
Eric
recently
commented
on
his
respect
for
a
man
John
Paul
II
who
survived
Nazism
Communism
an
assasination
attempt
and
countless
other
notable
instances
I
too
admire
Karol
Jozef
Wojtyla
for
his
perserverance
of
spirit
and
integrity
However
I
refuse
to
bestow
any
higher
degree
of
admiration
or
respect
for
Wojtyla
other
than
that
which
is
reserved
for
a
fellow
man
The
same
goes
for
the
woman
known
as
Mother
Teresa
who
has
been
beatified
and
is
en
route
to
becoming
a
canonized
saint
Agnes
Gonxha
Bojaxhiu
was
nothing
more
than
a
daughter
of
Christ
a
saint
before
she
was
ever
declared
so
by
any
papal
authority
These
are
perhaps
definitive
elements
of
Post-Reformation
Christianity
The
Reformation
was
in

are
performing

I'm
tired
of
my

Catholicism
in

and
Christianity
as
a
whole
being
ridiculed
by
Hollywood
assholes
who
funnel
millions
into

the

the

be
stricken

In

were
debasing

Supporters
insisted
that
Congress
has
always
had

Noah's

probably
about

not

McGivern's
900,000
effort
to
investigate
a
Mount

structure
he's
90
percent
sure
is
Noah's
Ark
never
happened
National
Geographic
News
reports
But
the
news
service
says
McGivern
may
have
known
that
the
Turkish
government
wouldn't
allow
them
to
climb
the
mountain
due
to
security
restrictions
McGivern
may
have
been
more
interested
in
generating
publicity
than
mounting
a
serious
search
critics
now
suggest
writes
Stefan
Lovgren
By
making
an
early
announcement
he
may
have
tried
to
persuade
the
Turkish
government
into
granting
him
a
permit
Few
expeditions
have
actually
obtained
clearance
to
climb
Mount
Ararat
which
is
located
in
a
military
zone
The
choice
of
expedition
leader
a
Turkish
academic
named
Ahmet
Ali
Arslan
who
claims
to
have
climbed
Mount
Ararat
50
times
in
40
years
also
raised
a
red
flag
with
those
familiar
with
previous
expeditions
Sources
told
Christianity
Today
earlier
this
year
that
Arslan
would
be
a
boon
to
the
expedition
and
would
help
the
team
get
the
necessary
permits
The
government
of
Turkey
did
not
issue
a
research
visa
which
is
sad
but
it's
their
country
McGivern
told
the
conservative
news
site
WorldNetDaily
for
an
August
article
We
haven't
totally
given
up
but
it's
pretty
obvious
they're
not
going
to
give
us
one
But
earlier
this
month
McGivern
told
the
Honolulu
Star-Bulletin
that
he
has
given
up
and
won't
try
to
put
another
expedition
together
This
was
the
year
he
said
I
don't
have
Ark
fever
like
many
who
go
year
after
year
A
good
businessman
calculates
what
amount
of
money
and
time
he
will
invest
and
has
to
know
when
to
walk
away
Of
course
Noah's
Ark
is
totally
different
way
beyond
business
for
me
Christians
Jews
and
Muslims
believe
in
it
It
will
confirm
the
faith
of
millions
and
many
will
be
brought
to
faith
It
will
change
how
scientists
look
at
the
world."To
me
McGivern's
motivation
perhaps
being
the
confirmation
of
or
bringing
to
faith
of
millions
of
people
the
world
over
is
terribly
misguided
It
seems
McGivern
misunderstands
the
true
meaning
of
faith
Do
we
need
to
ever
unearth
the
ruins
of
Noah's
ark
if
they
even
still
exist
to
justify
our
Christian
faith
to
the
world
Absolutely
not
We
do
not
need
signs
or
physical
evidence
of
any
sort
to
prove
the
legitmacy
of
the
Lord's
sovereignty
Those
who
place
their
faith
in
the
Lord
already
have
all
the
evidence
they
need
in
life--His
creation
as
is...and
the
acknowledgement
of
the
everyday
effects
of
His
grace
in
our
lives
By
the
way
there
are
quite
a
few
scientists
of
faith
out
there
who
do
not
require
the
discovery

The

at

over
whose
intelligence
service
was
to

for
bogus

suggesting
Saddam
Hussein
was
seeking
to
buy
material
for
nuclear
bombs
has
admitted
that
he
was
in
the
pay
of

His
admission
to
investigating
magistrates
in
Rome
on
Friday
apparently
confirms
suggestions
that
by
commissioning
Giacomo
to
procure
and

documents
France
was

for
some
of
the
information
later
used
by
Britain
and
the
United

to
promote
the
case
for
war
with

Italian
diplomats
have
claimed
that
by
disseminating
bogus
documents
stating
that
Iraq
was
trying
to
buy
low-grade
yellowcake
uranium
from
Niger
France
was
trying
to
set

Britain

in
the
hope
that
when
the
mistake
was
revealed
it
would
undermine
the

for

which
it
wanted
to

However
he
reportedly
also
added
that
he
had
believed
that
the
documents
in

were
genuine
and
to
have
never
suspected
that
they

Martino
has

the

After

French

one
western
diplomat
said
Martino
may
have
thought
the
safest
thing
was
to
hand
himself
over
to
the
Italians
Investigators
in
Rome
suspect
that
Mr
Martino
was
first
engaged
by
the
French
secret
services
five
years
ago
when
he
was
asked
to
investigate
rumours
of
illicit
trafficking
in
uranium
from
Niger
He
is
thought
to
have
then
been
retained
the
following
year
to
collect
more
information
It
was
then
that
he
is
suspected
of
having
assembled
a
dossier
containing
both
real
and
bogus
documents
from
Niger
the
latter
apparently
forged
by
a
diplomat
In

as
a
key
infiltration
route
for
sending
operatives
into

according
to

Mexican

Mexican
intelligence
agencies
have
identified
at

two
routes
for

the

The

to

then
take
a

from

use

to

there

The
Numbers
and
Places
It's
fair
to
estimate
based
on
a
TIME
investigation
that
the
number
of
illegal
aliens
flooding
into
the
U.S
this
year
will
total
3
million-enough
to
fill
22,000
Boeing
737-700
airliners
or
60
flights
every
day
for
a
year
It
will
be
the
largest
wave
since
2001
and
roughly
triple
the
number
of
immigrants
who
will
come
to
the
U.S
by
legal
means
No
one
knows
how
many
illegals
are
living
in
the
U.S
but
estimates
run
as
high
as
15
million
Who
are
these
new
arrivals
While
the
vast
majority
are
Mexicans
a
small
but
sharply
growing
number
come
from
other
countries
including
those
with
large
populations
hostile
to
the
U.S
From
Oct
1
of
last
year
until
Aug
25
along
the
southwest
border
the
border
patrol
estimates
that
it
apprehended
55,890
people
who
fall
into
the
category
described
officially
as
other
than
Mexicans
or
OTMs
With
five
weeks
remaining
in
the
fiscal
year
the
number
is
nearly
double
the
28,048
apprehended
in
all
of
2002
But
that's
just
how
many
were
caught
TIME
estimates
based
on
longtime
government
formulas
for
calculating
how
many
elude
capture
that
as
many
as
190,000
illegals
from
countries
other
than
Mexico
have
melted
into
the
U.S
population
so
far
this
year
The
border
patrol
which
is
run
by
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
refuses
to
break
down
OTMs
by
country
But
local
law
officers
ranchers
and
others
who
confront
the
issue
daily
tell
TIME
they
have
encountered
not
only
a
wide
variety
of
Latin
Americans
from
Guatemala
El
Salvador
Brazil
Nicaragua
and
Venezuela
but
also
intruders
from
Afghanistan
Bulgaria
Russia
and
China
as
well
as
Egypt
Iran
and
Iraq
How
the
heck
are
Bulgarians
and
Egyptians
blending
in
while
crossing
from
Mexico
The
border
patrol
by
nature
an
earnest
and
hard-working
corps,is
no
match
for
the
onslaught
From
last
October
through
Aug
25
it
apprehended
nearly
1.1
million
illegals
in
all
its
operations
around
the
U.S
But
for
every
person
it
picks
up
at
least
three
make
it
into
the
country
safely

A
Government
Advocates
the
Open
Compromising
of
U.S
Security
On
the
Mexican
side
of
the
border
President
Vicente
Fox
has
actively
encouraged
the
migration
He
made
his
goal
clear
in
2000
when
he
called
for
a
fully
open
border
within
10
years
with
a
free
flow
of
people
workers
moving
between
the
two
countries
When
U.S
opposition
to
the
proposal
intensified
after
9/11
Fox
sought
the
same
goal
through
the
back
door
He
pushed
U.S
businesses
and
city
and
state
governments
to
accept
as
legal
identification
a
card
called
a
matricula
consular
issued
by
Mexican
consulates
That
has
allowed
illegals
to
secure
driver's
licenses
and
other
forms
of
identification
and
open
bank
accounts
Earlier
this
year
Fox
pushed
U.S
bankers
to
make
it
easier
for
Mexicans
working
here-some
of
them
legally
but
most
illegally-to
ship
U.S
dollars
back
home
Because
of
the
exploding
illegal
population
the
money
sent
back
represents
the
third
largest
source
of
revenue
in
Mexico's
economy
trailing
only
oil
and
manufacturing
That
figure
reached
a
record
13
billion

year
Two

So
what
does
the

You

It's
the
waning
days
of
summer
in
2002
in
Klamath
Falls
Ore
a
city
of
about
19,000
on
the
eastern
edge
of
the
Cascade
Mountains
Two
nuns
who
belonged
to
the
Order
of
the
Immaculate
Heart
of
Mary
in
Bellevue
Wash
had
made
one
of
their
periodic
trips
to
Klamath
Falls
to
carry
out
missionary
work
As
they
had
in
the
past
Sister
Helena
Maria
her
church
name
53
and
Sister
Mary
Louise
52
checked
into
a
Best
Western
motel
On
Saturday
Aug
31
they
spent
the
evening
proselytizing
and
selling
religious
items
outside
an
Albertsons
supermarket
After
returning
to
the
motel
the
two
set
out
on
their
ritual
prayer
walk
shortly
after
midnight
They
were
dressed
in
the
blue
habits
they
always
wore
as
they
walked
on
a
darkened
bike
path
behind
the
motel
reciting
their
rosaries
As
they
reached
the
midway
point
in
their
prayers
and
turned
back
toward
the
motel
they
heard
a
bicycle
coming
up
behind
them
A
Hispanic
male
in
his
30s
or
40s
got
off
grabbed
both
women
and
began
kissing
them
The
more
they
resisted
the
angrier
he
became
He
finally
punched
Sister
Mary
Louise
in
the
right
eye
so
hard
that
she
fell
and
hit
her
head
on
a
rock
leaving
her
dazed
While
holding
Sister
Helena
Maria
so
tightly
by
the
rosary
knotted
around
her
neck
that
she
gasped
for
breath
he
raped
her
first
and
then
raped
and
sodomized
Sister
Mary
Louise
and
raped
Sister
Helena
Maria
a
second
time
The
man
pulled
the
veil
over
Sister
Mary
Louise
told
her
not
to
move
or
he
would
kill
her
climbed
back
on
his
MTB
Super
Crown
bike
and
pedaled
off
Sister
Helena
Maria
was
dead
The
rosary
had
been
wound
so
tightly
its
marks
were
embedded
in
her
neck
Later
that
day
police
tracked
a
suspect
to
another
motel
where
they
began
questioning
him
He
gave
his
name
as
Jesus
Franco
Flores
which
turned
out
to
be
one
of
many
names
he
used
In
the
end
he
confessed
to
beating
and
raping
both
nuns
He
was
not
supposed
to
be
in
the
U.S
he
had
been
deported
at
least
three
times

told

On

after
being

three

Annan
said
From

it

On
The
Duty
Of

To

HT:William

This
is
as
relevant
today
as
it
was
almost
100
years
ago
Mark
Twain
On
The
Duty
Of
Christians
To
Vote
It
will
be
conceded
that
every
man's
first
duty
is
to
God
it
will
also
be
conceded
and
with
strong
emphasis
that
a
Christian's
first
duty
is
to
God
It
then
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
that
it
is
his
duty
to
carry
his
Christian
code
of
morals
to
the
polls
and
vote
them
Whenever
he
shall
do
that
he
will
not
find
himself
voting
for
an
unclean
man
a
dishonest
man
Whenever
a
Christian
votes
he
votes
against
God
or
for
Him
and
he
knows
this
quite
well
God
is
an
issue
in
every
election
He
is
a
candidate
in
the
person
of
every
clean
nominee
on
every
ticket
His
purity
and
His
approval
are
there
to
be
voted
for
or
voted
against
and
no
fealty

fealty

of

duty
to
Him
is

If
Christians
should
vote
their
duty
to
God
at
the
polls
they
would
carry
every
election
and
do
it
with
ease
They
would
elect
every
clean
candidate
in
the
United
States
and
defeat
every
soiled
one
Their
prodigious
power
would
be
quickly
realized
and
recognized
and
afterward
there
would
be
no
unclean
candidates
upon
any
ticket
and
graft
would
cease
No
church
organization
can
be
found
in
the
country
that
would
elect
men
of
foul
character
to
be
its
shepherd
itstreasurer

superintendent
of
its
Sunday-school
It
wouldbe
revolted
at
the
idea
it
would
consider
such
an
election
aninsult
to
God
Yet
every
Christian
congregation
in
the
country
elects
foul
men
to
public
office
while
quite
aware
that
this
also
is
an
open
and
deliberate
insult
to
God
who
can
not
approve
and
does
not
approve
the
placing
of
the
liberties
and
the
well-being
of
His
children
in
the
hands
of
infamous
men
It
is
the
Christian
congregations
that
are
responsible
for
the
filling
of
our
public
offices
with
criminals
for
the
reason
that
they
could
prevent
it
if
they
chose
to
do
it
They
could
prevent
it
without
organizing
a
league
without
framing
a
platform
without
making
any
speeches
or
passing
any
resolutions
in
a
word
without
concert
of
any
kind
They
could
accomplish
it
by
each
individual
resolving
to
vote
for
God
at
the
polls
that
is
to
say
vote
for
the
candidate
whom
God
would
approve
Can
a
man
imagine
such
a
thing
as
God
being
a
Republican
or
a
Democrat
and
voting
for
a
criminal
or
a
blackguard
merely
because
party
loyalty
required
it
Then
can
we
imagine
that
a
man
can
improve
upon
God's
attitude
in
this
matter
and
by
help
of
professional
politicians
invent
a
better
policy
God
has
no
politics
but
cleanliness
and
honesty
and
it
is
good
enough
for
men
If
the
Christians
of
America
could
be
persuaded
to
vote
God
and
a
clean
ticket
it
would
bring
about
a
moral
revolution
that
would
be
incalculably
beneficent
It
would
save
the
country
a
country
whose
Christians
have
betrayed
it
and
are
destroying
it

The
assault
on
assault

continues
Jay
knows
what's
up
T]he
term
military
style
is
very
misleading
All
the
weapons
under
the
assault
weapons
ban
are
semi-automatic
guns
not
fully
automatic
weapons
which
have
been
illegal
to
own
unless
specficially
licensed
to
do
so
in
this
country
since
1934
In
fact
it's
difficult
to
own
a
fully
automatic
weapon
in
the
United
States
In
order
to
do
so
you
must
A
Have
a
full
FBI
background
check
done
Not
the
regular
background
check
but
a
full
investigation
that
can
take
months
B
The
weapon
must
be
registered
C
A
transfer
tax
of
200
must
be
paid
for
each
item
D
Must
obtain

E
Must
obtain
local
law
enforcement
approval
F
Weapon
must
have
been
produced
prior
to
1986
G
Must
obtain
ATF
approval
The
ban
from
1994
was
strictly
cosmetic
legislation
The
people
who
wrote
the
legislation
went
through
a
book
and
picked
out
weapons
that
looked
scary
and
put
them
under
the
ban

The

a

made
up
of
American
Muslims
and
American

of

who
feel
that

violence

terrorism
have
not
been
fully
rejected
by
the
Muslim
community
in
the
post

era
The
Coalition
was
created
to
eliminate
broad
base
support
for
Islamic
extremism
and
terrorism
and
to
strengthen
secular
democratic
institutions
in
the
Middle
East
and
the
Muslim
World
by
supporting
Islamic
reformation
efforts
The
Coalition
promotes
a
modern
secular
interpretation
of
Islam
which
is
peace-loving
democracy-loving
and
compatible
with
other
faiths
and
beliefs
The
Coalition's

are
unique
it
is
the
only
mainstream
American-Muslim
organization
willing
to
attack
extremism
and
terrorism
unambiguously
Unfortunately
most
other
Muslim
leaders
and
organizations
believe
that
when
it
comes
to
terrorism
the
end
justifies
the
means
Other
Americans
have
spoken
up
against
terrorism
but
never
before
has
this
message
come
with
such
clarity
from
Muslims
or
Arabs
Muslims
are
the
only
ones
who
can
solve
the
problem
of
terror
in
Islam
and
sadly
until

they
were

We'll
go
forward
from
this
moment
By
Leonard
Pitts
Jr
of
the
Miami
Herald
September
12
2001
We'll
go
forward
from
this
moment
It's
my
job
to
have
something
to
say
They
pay
me
to
provide
words
that
help
make
sense
of
that
which
troubles
the
American
soul
But
in
this
moment
of
airless
shock
when
hot
tears
sting
disbelieving
eyes
the
only
thing
I
can
find
to
say
the
only
words
that
seem
to
fit
must
be
addressed
to
the
unknown
author
of
this
suffering
You
monster
You
beast
You
unspeakable
bastard
What
lesson
did
you
hope
to
teach
us
by
your
coward's
attack
on
our
World
Trade
Center
our
Pentagon
us
What
was
it
you
hoped
we
would
learn
Whatever
it
was
please
know
that
you
failed
Did
you
want
us
to
respect
your
cause
You
just
damned
your
cause
Did
you
want
to
make
us
fear
You
just
steeled
our
resolve
Did
you
want
to
tear
us
apart
You
just
brought
us
together
Let
me
tell
you
about
my
people
We
are
a
vast
and
quarrelsome
family
a
family
rent
by
racial
social
political
and
class
division
but
a
family
nonetheless
We're
frivolous
yes
capable
of
expending
tremendous
emotional
energy
on
pop
cultural
minutiae
a
singer's
revealing
dress
a
ball
team's
misfortune
a
cartoon
mouse
We're
wealthy
too
spoiled
by
the
ready
availability
of
trinkets
and
material
goods
and
maybe
because
of
that
we
walk
through
life
with
a
certain
sense
of
blithe
entitlement
We
are
fundamentally
decent
though
peaceful
loving
and
compassionate
We
struggle
to
know
the
right
thing
and
to
do
it
And
we
are
the
overwhelming
majority
of
us
people
of
faith
believers
in
a
just
and
loving
God
Some
people
you
perhaps
think
that
any
or
all
of
this
makes
us
weak
You're
mistaken
We
are
not
weak
Indeed
we
are
strong
in
ways
that
cannot
be
measured
by
arsenals
IN
PAIN
Yes
we're
in
pain
now
We
are
in
mourning
and
we
are
in
shock
We're
still
grappling
with
the
unreality
of
the
awful
thing
you
did
still
working
to
make
ourselves
understand
that
this
isn't
a
special
effect
from
some
Hollywood
blockbuster
isn't
the
plot
development
from
a
Tom
Clancy
novel
Both
in
terms
of
the
awful
scope
of
their
ambition
and
the
probable
final
death
toll
your
attacks
are
likely
to
go
down
as
the
worst
acts
of
terrorism
in
the
history
of
the
United
States
and
probably
the
history
of
the
world
You've
bloodied
us
as
we
have
never
been
bloodied
before
But
there's
a
gulf
of
difference
between
making
us
bloody
and
making
us
fall
This
is
the
lesson
Japan
was
taught
to
its
bitter
sorrow
the
last
time
anyone
hit
us
this
hard
the
last
time
anyone
brought
us
such
abrupt
and
monumental
pain
When
roused
we
are
righteous
in
our
outrage
terrible
in
our
force
When
provoked
by
this
level
of
barbarism
we
will
bear
any
suffering
pay
any
cost
go
to
any
length
in
the
pursuit
of
justice
I
tell
you
this
without
fear
of
contradiction
I
know
my
people
as
you
I
think
do
not
What
I
know
reassures
me
It
also
causes
me
to
tremble
with
dread
of
the
future
In
the
days
to
come
there
will
be
recrimination
and
accusation
fingers
pointing
to
determine
whose
failure
allowed
this
to
happen
and
what
can
be
done
to
prevent
it
from
happening
again
There
will
be
heightened
security
misguided
talk
of
revoking
basic
freedoms
We'll
go
forward
from
this
moment
sobered
chastened
sad
But
determined
too
Unimaginably
determined
THE
STEEL
IN
US
You
see
the
steel
in
us
is
not
always
readily
apparent
That
aspect
of
our
character
is
seldom
understood
by
people
who
don't
know
us
well
On
this
day
the
family's
bickering
is
put
on
hold
As
Americans
we
will
weep
as
Americans
we
will
mourn
and
as
Americans
we
will
rise
in
defense
of
all
that
we
cherish
So
I
ask
again
What
was
it
you
hoped
to
teach
us
It
occurs
to
me
that
maybe
you
just
wanted
us
to
know
the
depths
of
your
hatred
If
that's
the
case
consider
the
message
received
And
take
this
message
in
exchange
You
don't
know
my
people
You
don't
know
what
we're
capable
of
You
don't
know
what
you
just
started
But
you're
about
to
learn

From

Former
Vice
President
Al
Gore
has
compared
President
Bush's
Christian
faith
with
fundamentalist
Islam
saying
it
emphasizes
vengeance
and
brimstone
In

with

Gore
who
says
he's

expressed

for

of

It's

It's

An
excerpt
Alice
Perman
the

co-writer
conceded
that
Jarrah
who
is
torn
between
jihad
and
an
ordinary
life
in
the
West
was
one
of
the
more
sympathetic
terrorists
Former

she
spoke
to
all
talked
about
this
likeable
man
she
said
We
chose
him
because
his
story
was
less
straightforward
He
was
a
complicated
character
and
would
have
a
greater
resonance
with
the
audience
Karim
Saleh
a
Lebanese
actor
who
played
Jarrah
said
It's
hard
to
be
sympathetic
to
someone
who
allowed
himself
to
be
so
dominated
by
people
and
ideas
and
absorbed
by
a
group."I'm
inclined
to
agree
with
Saleh
I
myself
am
torn
between
nuking

assasinating

The

From

Russian
President
Vladimir

blasted
U.S

officials
Monday
accusing
them
of
supporting
Chechen
separatists
and
undermining
his
war
on
terror
by
calling
on
Russia
to
seek
dialogue
with
people
whom

called

Why
don't

Osama
bin
Laden
invite
him
to
Brussels
or
to
the
White
House
and
engage
in
talks
ask
him
what
he
wants
and

it
to
him
so
he

You

why
should
we
talk

people
who

as

time
Russia
complained
to
the
Bush
administration
about
meetings
held
between

Chechen
separatist
representatives
the
U.S

information

technical

were
broadcast
by

By

NTV's

at
1:54

the
criticism
it
took
after
showing
the

raid
on

NTV
was
accused
of

the
operation
to

NTV

from
1994-96
and

over
controversial
coverage

Raf
Shakirov
did
not
immediately
give
the

behind
the
move
Interfax

reported
But
sources
close

told

that
Shakirov's
firing
was
initiated
by
the
Kremlin
infuriated
by
the
newspaper's
coverage
of
the
Beslan
hostage
drama
Shakirov
has
a
history
of
resignations
and
firings
as
a
result
of
his
criticisms
As
editor-in-chief
of
the
Kommersant-Daily
newspaper
Shakirov
was
dismissed
in
connection
with
an
article
criticizing
the
then
Russian
prime
minister
Yevgeny
Primakov
Putin
is
unlikely
to
quickly
ward
off
increasing
domestic
and
international
media
criticism
as
contrasting
reports
and
alleged
lies
and
coverups
emanating
from
the
Kremlin
continue
Mosnews.com
briefly
describes
the
growing
anger
The
popular
daily
tabloid
Moskovsky
Komsomolets
blasted
the
government
for
what
it
called
lies
over
the
latest
terror
attacks
We
are
constantly
being
lied
to
the
paper
wrote
referring
to
the
latest
crashes
as
well
as
earlier
blasts
on
a
Moscow
street
that
preceded
them
I
will
never
believe
the
article
goes
that
special
forces
did
not
know
how
many
hostages
were
being
held
in
Beslan
Official
statistics
put
the
number
at
354
but
witnesses
said
well
over
1,200
were
being
held
The
daily
Kommersant
however
wrote
that
blaming
such
events
on
international
terrorism
as
the
Kremlin
has
done
allows
governments
all
over
the
world
not
to
assume
their
responsibilities
for
the
deaths
of
their
citizens
joining
a
number
of
papers
that
expressed
surprise
and
concern
that
Putin
did
not
mention
the
conflict
in
Chechnya
when
talking
about
the
recent
events
It's
as
if
all
the
children
did
not
die
because
of
a
war
in
Chechnya
that
has
been
going
on
for
10

accounts

Chechnya
campaign
devastated
the
morale
of
Russia's
military
prowess
as
well
as
the
public's
faith
in
what
was
realistically
portrayed
to
the
world
as
a
disreputable
defeat
The
second
offensive
on
Chechnya
was
deployed
with
but
one
thing
in
mind
victory
at
all
costs
Promising
a
punishing
and
unrelenting
attack
on
the
rebel
province
Russia
gradually
overcame
the
scrappy
albeit
strong-willed
resistance
liberating
the
capital
of
Grozny
and
moving
on
to
the
remaining
mountain
strongholds
In
noncompliance
with
their
plan
were
the
media
soldiers
on
a
mission
to
expose
what
the
world
would
later
see
as
reminders
of
Soviet
practices
of
past
experience
Ruthless
atrocities
performed
not
only
on
rebel
POWS
but
of
Chechen
civilians
as
well
surfaced
from
the
battlefront
along
with
rumors
of
concentration
or
interrogation
camps
and
random
weapons
searches
of
no
intention
other
than
to
harass
Politically
defiant
members
of
the
media
are
quick
to
face
the
wrath
of
the
Kremlin's
intolerance
for
meddlesome
conflict
On
March
16th
a
Yak-40
jet
carrying
nine
passengers
out
of
Moscow
including
Western-sympathetic
journalist
Artyom
Borovik
who
was
known
for
his
reports
of
the
Soviet
Army's
defeat
in
Afghanistan
and
also
of
the
corruption
in
Yeltsin's
cabinet
mysteriously
plunged
to
the
earth
just
shortly
after
takeoff
Vivid
accounts
of
horrific
atrocities
in
Chechnya
were
helped
brought
to
light
by
the
Russian
journalist
Andrei
Babitsky
a
widely-renown
correspondent
of
the
U.S
funded
Radio
Liberty
organization
Babitsky
operated
dangerously
in
the
face
of
the
Kremlin
as
a
security
threat
with
each
report
he
conveyed
to
the
West
Constantly
having
to
cover
his
tracks
and
disappear
only
to
allegedly
resurface
again
in
time
Babitsky
was
detained
by
Russian
troops
in
mid-January
accused
of
being
a
guerilla
unit
Moscow's
disdain
for
the
media
was
apparent
when
by
his
own
request
Babitsky
was
transferred
to
Chechen
guerrillas
in
exchange
for
two
Russian
captives
However
much
uncertainty
to
whether
the
exchange
actually
took
place
stood
as
the
two
Chechen
representatives
were
masked
during
the
taped
trade-off
Oleg
Kusov
a
Radio
Liberty/Radio
Free
Europe
colleague
recently
spoke
with
Babitsky
who
told
him
he
refused
to
be
traded
to
masked
men
and
told
the
Russians
he'd
not
comply
with
the
exchange
Babitsky
stated
in
an
interview
published
on
Radio
Liberty's
website
I
can
say
to
you
that
at
first
I
was
not
in
the
hands
of
the
special
security
forces
but
of
sadists
who
detained
me
at
the
Chernokozovo
concentration
camp
The
Chernokozovo
filtration
camp
rumored
instances
of
torture
rape
and
beatings
of
soldiers
journalists
and
citizens
Then
a]cting
President
Vladimir
Putin
expressed
his
disapproval
for
Babitsky's
containment
in
detention
and
ordered
officials
to
investigate
the
issue
Meanwhile
Babitsky
declared
himself
on
a
hunger
strike
until
he
is
freed
Interfax
reports
Putin
speaking
on
Babitsky's
case
I
don't
think
that
the
law
enforcement
organs
should
be
holding
him
behind
bars
and
that
obviously
Babitsky
fell
into
a
difficult
situation
and
got
completely
mixed
up
It
is
inexpedient
to
hold
Babitsky
in
custody
and
I
asked
him
to
deal
with
this
case
more
carefully

Is

For

As

But

just
what
exactly
Though
my
knowledge
of
Russia
is
mostly
limited
to
Soviet
history
and
very
little
about
ethnic
conflict
I
do
know
Chechens
are
often
lumped
into
one
big
separatist
movement
The
problem
with
using
such
homogenizing
means
of
defining
the
actors
in
these
incidents
is
the
simple
fact
that
it
ignores
literally
centuries
upon
centuries
of
georelational
conflict
between
Russia
Chechnya
and
Georgia
too
The
Chechen
separatist
movement
was
not
merely
another
domino
falling
from
the
Empire
after
the
crumbling
of
the
Soviet
Union
in
1991
For
all
of
you

Chechen
conflict

BOOK

by

Russian
Information
Centre
RIA
Novosti
Georgy
Bovt
of
the
Moscow
Times
writes
a
stinging
criticsm
of
his
own
government's
ineptitude
with
adapting
its
agencies
and
resources
to
address
the
threat
of
domestic
terrorism
His
article
raises
several
points
that
hit
just
too
close
to
home
Today
the
truth
is
far
more
obvious
The
main
threat
to
Putin's
presidency
as
a
way
of
running
the
country
is
posed
not
by
the
economy
or
by
widespread
discontent
over
housing
issues
and
pension
reform
Terrorism
is
the
real
threat
The
difference
between
Russia
in
1999
the
raid
into
Dagestan
2002
Nord
Ost
and
2004
is
that
however
the
authorities
decide
to
resolve
the
crisis
in
Beslan
it
is
obvious
that
the
state
must
review
and
reform
its
anti-terrorist
strategy
in
Chechnya
its
system
for
combatting
terrorism
nationwide
and
the
way
the
security
services
operate
The
crisis
has
now
reached
a
new
level
requiring
a
qualitatively
new
approach
We
need
to
face
facts
We're
not
conducting
an
anti-terrorist
operation
in
Chechnya
We're
at
war
with
terror
and
terrorists
And
special
forces
units
don't
win
wars
the
people
do
But
before
the
people
can
rise
to
this
occasion
they
must
be
involved
in
forming
the
plan
of
attack
We
need
to
change
the
way
law
enforcement
and
the
security
services
operate
Throwing
money
at
the
problem
won't
help
These
agencies
must
be
held
publicly
accountable
for
their
performance
Does
this
not
all
sound
familiar
Softly
damning
9/11
Reports
aside
the
recent
string
of
terrorist
attacks
and
activities
in
Russia
just
goes
to
show
how
unprepared
all
civilized
nations
really
are
in
combatting
the
threat
of
Islamo-fascist
terrorism
Remember
we
in
the
United
States
are
surrounded
by
Iberian
nations
in
the
south
and
a
highly
Europeanized
nation
in
the
north
Famous

Yakov

Mother
Russia

good
because
somebody
is
always

Russia
is

said
the

who

The
officer
turned
down
the
request
saying
that
any
shooting
could
alarm
the
hostage-takers
and
they
did
not
want
to
risk

Those

not

he

Iran
admits
it
provides
facilities
to
Al-Zarqawi
to
conduct
his
operations
in
Iraq
A
reliable
Iranian
source
confirmed
that
Brig
Gen
Qassim
Sullaimani
the
commander
of
Al-Quds
corps
in
the
Iranian
Revolutionary
Guards
told
a
closed
seminar
that
Iran
provides
facilities
to
the
Jordanian
extremist
scholar
Abu
Mosaab
Al-Zarqawi
Al-Zarqawi
is
accused
of
conducting
most
of
the
suicide
operations
and
attacks
in
Iraq
Sullaimani
justified
this
cooperation
because
Al-Zarqawi's
activities
in
Iraq
serve
the
high
interests
of
the
Islamic
Republic
Among
these
interests
is
the
prevention
of
a
federalist
secular
regime
in
Iraq
that
cooperates
with
the
United
States
The
source
who
attended
the
closed
seminar
for
students
of
strategic
and
defense
studies
at
the
university
of
Imam
Al-Hussein
told
Al-Sharq
Al-Awsat
newspaper
that
Brig
Gen
Sullaimani
said
Al-Zarqawi
and
members
of
his
organization
Ansar
Al-Islam
don't
need
prior
permission
to
enter
Iran
There
are
specific
border
points
which
stretch
from
Halabja
in
the
north
to
Elam
in
the
south
where
Al-Zarqawi
and
more
than
20
Ansar
Al-Islam
commanders
can
enter
Iran
whenever
they
want
The
source
said
Brig
Gen
Sullaimani
who
oversees
the
activities
of
the
revolutionary
guards
intelligence
units
and
Al-Quds
corps
operating
in
Iraq
answered
questions
from
students
about
why
Iran
supports
a
person
who
is
anti-Shia
like
Al-Zarqawi
who
previously
was
accused
of
his
involvement
in
the
killing
of
Ayet
Allah
Mohammed
Baqir
Al-Hakim
president
of
the
high
council
of
Islamic
revolution
in
Iraq
Despite
the
accusation
coming
from
close
circles
to
the
Iranian
regime
leader
Ali
Kham'ani
Sullaimani
considers
Al-Zarqawi's
involvement
in
Al-Hakim's
killing
unconfirmed
Instead
he
said
Al-Zarqawi's
activities
now
serve
the
high
interests
of
the
Islamic
Republic
The
establishment
of
a
secular
Iraq
that
cooperates
with
the
United
States
is
more
dangerous
than
the
former
Baath
regime
The
new
regime
will
form
according
to
Al-Sullaimani
a
real
threat
to
the
pure
revolutionary
Mohamedi
Islam
and
the
scholars
state
according
to
the
source
Al-Sharq
Al-Awsat
newspaper
was
told
that
Al-Zarqawi
moved
to
Iran
a
few
months
after
events
in
Falluja
He
spent
a
few
weeks
in
a
military
camp
subjoined
to
the
revolutionary
guards
in
Mahran
on
the
border
with
Iraq
before
he
left
it
to
go
to
the
city
of
Baquba
with
the
help
of
Al-Quds
corps
It's
worth
mentioning
Al-Quds
corps
was
formed
toward
the
end
of
Al-Khumaini
era
to
hunt
for
opposition
personalities
and
powers
inside
and
outside
Iran
Their
jobs
and
responsibilities
changed
during
the
last
few
years
Today
it
is
responsible
for
Iraq
Afghanistan
Arab
and
Islamic
countries
with
indirect
connections
to
the
United
States
A
former
corps
chief
said
Abu-Mosaab
Al-Zarqawi
escaped
to
Turkey
last
year
after
being
in
Iran
and
entered
Iraq
more
than
a
year
ago
He
confirmed
to
the
newspaper
that
a
meeting
was
held
last
June
between
Al-Zarqawi
and
a
Lebanese
fugitive
Emad
Mughania
at
one
of
Al-Quds
corps
centers
in
Kermanshah
providence
in
western
Iran
The
source
said
Mughania
played
an
influential
role
in
forming
the
Al-Mahdi
Army
Al-Mahdi
Army
belongs
to
the
strict
Shia
religious
cleric
Muqtada
Al-Sadr
and
trains
its
members
in
camps
inside
Iran
He
also
mentioned
the
entrance
of
Shia
fighters
from
Lebanon
to
Iraq
dressed
as
religious
studies
students
These
fighters
then
join
Al-Madi
Army
under
the
supervision
of
Emad
Mughania
Mughania
underwent
a
cosmetic
surgery
recently
in
a
sanitarium
for
the
revolutionary
guards
in
northern
Iran
to
change
his
face
This
is
the
5th
surgery
for
Mughania
who's
been
chased
by
Western
and
Arabic
intelligence
organizations
for
a
number
of
years
now
The
source
said
Mughania
kept
his
relationships
with
Aymen
Al-Thawahiri
the
number-two
man
in
Al-Qaida
organization
despite
the
difficulty
of
contacting
him
lately
He
added
that
Mughania
submitted
a
report
early
this
year
to
chief
of
the
revolutionary
guards
intelligence
after
a
visit
to
Iraq
The
report
outlined
the
importance
of
expanding
a
framework
of
collaboration
between
Al-Mahdi
Army
and
Al-Zarqawi's
group
Muqtada
has
lost
his
standing
among
the
Iraqi
shia
especially
Al-Najaf
while
gaining
more
supporters
in
the
Sunni
triangle
The
source
also
said
Iranian
president
Mohammed
Khatemi
objects
strongly
to
the
interference
of
the
revolutionary
guards
in
Iraq's
interior
affair
He
said
he
was
surprised
lately
by
a
report
he
received
from
an
official
in
the
Iraqi
government
who
is
a
friend
of
Iran
It
included
detailed
information
consolidated
with
numbers
on
the
wide
involvement
of
Al-Quds
corps
and
revolutionary
intelligence
in
the
terror
operations
that

system
no

Meanwhile
the
Daily
News
reports
a
somewhat
different
story
Detective
William
Sample
was
trying
to
prevent
protesters
from
breaking
through
a
police
barricade
at
Eighth
Ave
and
29th
St
when
he
was
pulled
off
his
scooter
and
kicked
repeatedly
in
the
head
Sample
was
injured
after
cops
let
a
group
called
the
Poor
People's
Economic
Human
Rights
Campaign
which
had
rallied
outside
the
United
Nations
march
through
the
city
even
though
it
did
not
have
a
permit
to
do
so
Along
the
way
another
officer
was
socked
in
the
face
And
when
the
crowd
neared
the
Garden
troublemakers
tried
to
push
through
police
barricades
So...basically
the
plain-clothes
officers
were
responding
to
a
call
after
the
protestors
sans
a
legal
permit...mind
you
began
attempting
to
overcome
the
police
barricades
The
Times
says
While
the
protesters
had
no
permit
they
reached
a
last-minute
accord
with
the
police
to
march
as
long
as
they
stayed
in
a
single
lane
Apparently
it
is
rather
difficult
to
move
past
street
barricades
while
remaining
in
a
single-file
line
CBSNew
York
describes
the
scene
in
a
degree
of
detail
that
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
Times
article
Hundreds
of
police
in
riot
gear
and
on
horses
swept
in
to
disperse
the
crowd
shouting
Move
Less
than
a
dozen
arrests
were
made
as
protesters
yelled
back
Whose
streets
Our
streets!'"CBS
also
inserted
a
quote
not
found
in
the
Times
piece
around
the
section
referring
to
the
NYPD
permitting
the
permit-less
group
to
march
They
asked
if
they
could
march
and
we
said
yes

Creates
Dilemma
for
Putin
By
Simon
Saradzhyan
Staff
Writer
The
hostage-taking
drama
evolving
in
North
Ossetia
has
put
forth
a
deadly
serious
dilemma
for
President
Vladimir
Putin
of
whether
to
continue
his
policy
of
refusing
to
negotiate
with
radical
groups
in
the
North
Caucasus
or
to
soften
his
line
and
meet
some
of
the
hostage-takers
demands
given
that
the
lives
of
more
than
100
children
are
at
stake
in
this
standoff
Absolutely
not
Number
one
rule
of
any
free
nation
on
Earth
in
dealing
with
terrorists
Do
NOT
negotiate
with
terrorists
Doing
so
even
once
sets
a
dangerous
precedent...thus
the
reason
why
the
U.S
maintains
this
practice
to
this
day
unless
of
course
JFK
II
is
elected
I
realize
children's
lives
are
at
stake
nevertheless
giving
in
once
would
only
affirm
the
value
of
utilizing
younger
hostages...In
other
words
if
using
kids
is
what
it
takes
to
get
the
Kremlin
to
bend
then
so
be
it
This
is
how
Putin
should
continue
to
operate
from
the
same
source
The
tactic
that
Russian
police
and
security
agencies
have
pursued
in
similar
situations
is
to
try
to
negotiate
the
release
of
as
many
hostages
as
possible
while
giving
commandos
time
to
prepare
for
a
storming
The
overall
strategy
of
Putin's
anti-terrorism
policy
has
also
been
invariable
and
has
boiled
down
to
consenting
to
negotiate
only
the
release
of
hostages
while
firmly
refusing
to
address
hostage-takers
other
demands
such
as
the
release
of
suspects
from
prison
the
withdrawal
of
troops
or
peace
negotiations
with
the
Chechen
rebels
However
this
hardline
stance
may
have
its
downside
as
well
On
one
hand
the
Kremlin's
consent
to
at
least
discuss
the
political
demands
would
help
to
secure
the
release
of
more
hostages
On
the
other
hand
such
a
concession
could
be
interpreted
as
a
sign
of
weakness
and
entail
not
only
further
concessions
but
also
new
hostage-takings
by
extremist
groups
looking
beyond
the
independence
of
Chechnya
to
the
establishment
of
an
entire
Islamic
state
in
the
North
Caucasus
Exactly
A
firm
refusal
to
negotiate
is
also
fraught
with
consequences
in
the
longer
term
Given
that
a
series
of
deadly
attacks
including
coordinated
raids
in
Ingushetia
in
June
and
a
string
of
suicide
bombings
in
Moscow
has
failed
to
affect
the
Kremlin's
line
the
extremists
might
opt
for
attacks
of
catastrophic
proportions
in
the
hope
that
the
greater
casualties
and
psychological
shock
would
cause
a
capitulation
If
this
is
the
case
Russia
may
have
an
even
more
suitable
example
to
support
their
claim
to
their
own
9-11
Beyond
that
the
question
remains--will
Russia
become
a
more
firm
ally
in
the
War
on
Terror
Intelligence
sharing
and
strong
words
aside
Moscow
may
be
forced
to
participate
militarily
on
the
grounds
of
geographic
defense
alone
They
have
their
hands
full
not
only
with
the
Chechen
crisis
but
with
separtist
Tbilsi
Georgia
too
The
election
of
pro-Kremlin
candidate
Alu
Alkhanov
who
won
74
percent
of
the
vote
in
Chechnya's
presidential
election
may
present
a
dilemma
in
and
of
itself
Alkhanov
replaces
the
other
Kremlin-backed
president
Akhmad
Kadyrov
who
was
assassinated
in
a
bomb
attack
last
spring
And
finally
Just
substitute
Donald
for
Sergei
Bush
for
Putin
and
America
for
Russia
and
this
part
should
ring
a
bell
When
commenting
on
the
bombing
of
the
two
airliners
and
the
suicide
attack
Defense
Minister
Sergei
Ivanov
who
is
close
to
Putin
told
Russian
reporters
early
Wednesday
morning
that
international
terror
networks
have
declared
war
on
Russia
In
fact
a
war
has
been
declared
on
Russia
a
war
where
there
is
no
front
line
and
the
enemy
cannot
be
seen

vetoes

California
Gov

will
veto
legislation
that
would
allow
nearly
2
million
illegal
immigrants
who
pass
criminal
background
checks
to
obtain
driver's

a
spokeswoman
said
on
Saturday
As
he
should
She
added
the
governor
also
wanted
licenses
for
illegal
immigrants
to
be
distinguishable
from
standard
driver's
licenses
a
provision
not
included
in
the
legislation
passed
by
state
lawmakers
How
could
that
NOT
have
been
considered
during
the
drafting
stage
Minority
groups
have
argued
that
allowing
illegal
immigrants
many
of
whom
are
Hispanics
to
obtain
driver's
licenses
could
make
the
state's
roads
safer
because
license
holders
would
need
to
pass
a
driver's
test
and
buy
car
insurance
The

vehicles
they

should

Hey
at

I
could
have
suggested
they
ride
in
the
back
of
a
tractor-trailer
Critics
have
said
allowing
illegal
immigrants
to
obtain
driver's
licenses
would
reward
those
who
break
immigration
laws.We
already
allow
them
access
to

why
not
let

UPDATE
From
World
Net
Daily
The
Elliot
Institute
reports
Studies
within
the
first
few
weeks
after
the
abortion
have
found
that
between
40
and
60
percent
of
women
questioned
report
negative
reactions
Within
8
weeks
after
their
abortions
55
percent
expressed
guilt
44
percent
complained
of
nervous
disorders
36
percent
had
experienced
sleep
disturbances
31
percent
had
regrets
about
their
decision
and
11
percent
had
been
prescribed
psychotropic
medicine
by
their
family
doctor
Among
the
many
physical
consequences
of
an
abortion
the
Elliot
Institute
has
documented
minor
infections
bleeding
fevers
chronic
abdominal
pain
gastro-intestinal
disturbances
and
vomiting
Also
listed
are
excessive
bleeding
embolism
ripping
or
perforation
of
the
uterus
anesthesia
complications
convulsions
hemorrhage
cervical
injury
and
endotoxic
shock
How
interesting
that
these
terms
will
not

Instead
curious
women
will
hear
the
results
of
studies
as
old
as
1989
like
this
one
from
PlannedParenthood.com
Research
studies
indicate
that
emotional
responses
to
legally
induced
abortion
are
largely
positive
Other
studies
date
back
to
1988
1985
and
1984

Pentagon

who
is
relaying
sensitive
information
to
two
representatives
of
the
American
Israel
Public
Affairs
Committee
AIPAC
a

organization
Surveillance

efforts
to
pass
information
from

to
the

representatives
and
then
to

Some
of
the
sensitive
materials
include
an
early
draft
of
a
Presidential
policy
directive
on
the
U.S

CBS

This

allegedly

to
strike

The

may

for
this
very
operation
According
to

The

the
spy
as

assigned
to
a

Kerry
takes

for

From

National
Review
Online
John
Kerry
speaking
at
a
Martin
Luther
King
day
celebration
in
Virginia
last
year
said
quote
I
remember
well
April
1968
I
was
serving
in
Vietnam
A
place
of
violence
When
the
news
reports
brought
home
to
me
and
my
crew
mates
the
violence
back
home
and
the
tragic
news
that
one
of
the
bullets
flying
that
terrible
spring
took
the
life
of
Dr
King
That
date
of
Dr
King's
death
was
April
4
1968
According
to
kerry's
website
it
was
not
until
November
17
1968
that
he
reported
for
duty
in
Vietnam

A
honest
reflection
on
media
objectivity
I
was
really
touched
by
Mike
Borrelli's
thoughtful
post
on
the
reality
that
is--media
bias--and
its
effect
on
the
now
disoriented
individual
seeking
the
facts
on
just
about
any
global
event
It
is
a
really
well
thought
out
and
balanced
portrayal
of
the
dilemma
the
want-to-be-informed
populace
face
everyday
The
only
correction
I
would
make
if
you
could
call
it
one
really
would
be
his
classification
of
organizations
like
Amnesty
International
as
objective"...though
hey
really
are
in
principle
However
if
you
analyze
closely
the
actions
they
criticize
there
is
an
appearance
of
actually
taking
a
position
on
certain
things
For
example
AI
has
employed
campaigns
to
prevent
the
use
of
certain
military
arsenal
namely
bombs
dropped
from
aircraft
in
the
Iraq/Afghanistan
wars
due
to
their
imprecise
nature
ie
their
tendency
to
claim
innocents
That
in
essence
can
be
seen
as
making
a
statement
against
an
often
integral
part
of
a
military
operation
Realistically
all
human
rights
organizations
would
rather
have
no
wars
at
all
if
they
had
their
say
but
then
again
who
wouldn't
Yet
in
the
end
we
need
organizations
like
AI
and
HRW
and
the
countless
other
NGO
watchdog
groups
to
report
and
bring
to
light
both
the
unintentional
errors/mistakes
AND
the
atrocities
that
occur
in
violent
conflict

As
we
enter
this
election
season
the
struggle
for
our
culture's
soul
has
simultaneously
produced
passivity
and
defeatism
in
some
evangelical
quarters
and
a
shrill
triumphalism
in
others
Neither

the

We
can
never

into

and
neglect
our
civic
responsibility
to
help
set
the
moral
tone
of
our

Leaving
your

in
ignorance
of
his
folly
is
inconsistent
with
the
command
to
love
him
and
so
political
and
cultural

Charles
Colson
Kerry
gave
a
big
speech
last
week
about
how
his
faith
is
so
important
to
him
He
announced
that
his
favorite
Bible
verse
is
John
16:3
Of
course
the
speech
writer
meant
John
3:16
but
nobody
in
the
Kerry
camp
was
familiar
enough
with
Scripture
to
catch
the
error
Fittingly
John
16:3
says
And
these
things
they
will
do
to
you
because
they
have
not
known
the
Father
nor
Me
The
Lord
works

Unknown
Albuquerque

So
let
me
ask
you
a
few
questions
Are
you
an
independent
Do
you
reject
partisan
labels
Do
you
like
to
weigh
each
candidate
on
the
merits
rather
than
simply
vote
the
party
line
Do
you
wait
until
the
last
weeks
of
the
presidential
election
before
you
make
up
your
mind
on
whom
to
vote
for
so
you
can
study
the
issues
as
much
as
possible
Do
you
watch
the
presidential
debates
and
feel
disappointed
that
you
didn't
get
enough
substance
on
the
issues
Well
bully
for
you
You
might
deserve
a
lollypop
but
you
don't
deserve
to
run
the
country
Unfortunately
you
and
people
like
you
do
But
as
a
matter
of
gross
generalization
no
segment
of
voters
is
less
deserving
of
the
high
esteem
they
get
from
the
media
and
politicians
than
independents
centrists
moderates
swing
voters
undecideds
and
others
we
generally
call
middle-of-the-roaders
If
you
wait
until
the
last
minute
to
figure
out
whom
to
vote
for
if
you
can't
tell
the
differences
between
the
parties
and
their
candidates
and
you're
not
politically
exotic
i.e
an
anarchist
or
a
libertarian
if
you
think
voting
is
like
a
Chinese
menu
where
you
can
pick
a
little
from
here
and
a
little
from
there
then
the
odds
are
you
don't
know
very
much
about
the
political
system
You
may
be
a
brilliant
neurosurgeon
but
I
know
interns
who
are
sharper
than
you

Check

by

Custred
at
VDare.com
from
October
2000
Although
the
article
may
be
dated
4
years
ago
the
only
change
is
the
worsening
of
the
situation
The
following
are
excerpts
but
I
highly
encourage
you
to
read
on
The
cost
and
bother
of
constant
trespass
and
the
fear
of
theft
and
burglary
have
meant
that
many
rural
people
in
Cochise
County
where
Douglas
is
located
are
now
arming
themselves
Warning
shots
have
been
fired
and
many
are
worried
that
something
worse
might
happen
What
frightens
the
ranchers
most
however
is
not
the
aliens
but
rather
drug
smugglers
These
are
well-armed
men
some
carrying
fully
automatic
weapons
Ranchers
in
both
San
Diego
and
Cochise
Counties
have
reported
seeing
armed
men
on
the
U.S
side
of
the
border
military
in
appearance
dressed
in
black
and
armed
with
automatic
rifles
Some
believe
that
they
are
from
the
Mexican
army
acting
in
support
of
smugglers
Whether
they
are
or
not
however
Mexican
army
units
and
armed
police
are
frequently
reported
entering
U.S
territory
a
violation
that
evokes
angry
response
when
U.S
authorities
stray
across
the
border
into
Mexico
Ron
Sanders
was
for
five
years
the
chief
of
the
Tucson
sector
of
the
border
patrol
until
his
retirement
in
August
1999
Hardly
a
month
goes
by
he
said
without
some
kind
of
incursion
by
Mexican
police
or
military
Sometimes
shooting
is
involved
He
recalls
an
armed
stand-off
on
the
U.S
side
of
the
border
between
the
Nogales
police
and
the
Mexican
army
The
latest
publicized
incursion
took
place
in
March
near
Santa
Teresa
New
Mexico
Two
Mexican
army
Humvees
penetrated
more
than
a
mile
into
the
United
States
and
fired
on
a
mounted
border
patrolman
and
on
a
border-patrol
vehicle
The
soldiers
were
detained
but
were
later
returned
to
Mexico
along
with
their
weapons
There
was
no
official
protest
from
Washington
even
though
firing
on
a
U.S
law
officer
is
a
felony
offense
Drug
smugglers
often
use
lonely
and
difficult
trails
through
the
mountains
or
go
on
horseback
through
more
remote
parts
of
the
desert
At
times
they
mingle
with
groups
of
aliens
or
follow
them
for
cover
On
occasion
they
also
use
aliens
as
mules
to
carry
drugs
across
the
border
in
payment
for
their
passage
One
rancher
near
Douglas
tells
of
a
young
illegal
who
knocked
at
a
neighbor's
door
one
night
The
young
man
had
slipped
away
from
his
group
because
its
guide
had
forced
them
all
to
carry
illicit
drugs
Fearing
they
might
all
end
up
killed
he
ran
to
the
nearest
house
begging
the
rancher
to
call
the
police
As
the
situation
near
Douglas
worsened
some
of
the
ranchers
decided
to
take
action
on
their
own
Roger
Barnett
owns
a
22,000-acre
ranch
outside
Douglas
Soon
he
and
his
brother
Don
like
his
neighbor
Larry
Vance
and
others
began
rounding
up
aliens
on
their
property
and
holding
them
until
the
border
patrol
arrived
to
arrest
them
Advocacy
groups
howled
in
protest
as
did
the
Mexican
government
Their
lawyers
demanded
that
the
ranchers
be
prosecuted
for
false
arrest
kidnapping
intimidation
criminal
assault
violation
of
civil
rights
in
short
anything
lawyers
can
come
up
with
to
advance
their
clients
interests
Larry
Vance
retorted
that
the
only
rights
that
have
been
violated
are
those
of
American
citizens
whose
privacy
property
and
nation
are
invaded
from
Mexico
the
Mexican
press
demonized
the
ranchers
as
racist
xenophobic
vigilantes
who
hunted
down
innocent
Mexican
migrants
like
animals
The
majority
of
Americans
favor
immigration
control
This
includes
half
the
Latino
population
Yet
the
addiction
of
American
agriculture
and
some
industries
to
cheap
foreign
labor
creates
contradictory
interests
within
the
country
and
an
attempt
by
the
government
to
cover
both
bases
at
once
Thus
we
see
the
passage
of
restrictive
laws
and
border
shell
games
to
keep
the
public
quiet
no
one
of
either
party
wants
another

and

to

firepower
On
one
hand
I
really
sympathize
with
the
premise
of
the
reservist's
lawsuit
that
a
period
of
enlistment
in
the
reserves
should
not
be
indefinite
and
to
be
prevented
from
returning
to
one's
home
after
his/her
committment
has
been
fulfilled
is
unfair
Yes
I
agree
As
for
me
I
consider
it
difficult
for
a
civilian
to
take
a
firm
stance
on
this
issue
unless
one
is
familiar
with
the
fine
print
Capt
Kincy
Clark
who
is
mentioned
in
the
suit
by
the
plaintiff
comments
that
reservists
know
when
signing
up
that
stop
loss
or
extension
of
service
is
a
possibility
Who
knows
if
the
concept
is
thoroughly
explained
to
enlistees
upon
signing
up
I
don't
doubt
it
However
the
plaintiff
has
apparently
served
in
the
Marine
Corps
and
Army
for
nine
years
on
active
duty
prior
to
his
enlistment
as
a
reservist
in
the
Army
National
Guard
for
the
past
three
years
One
must
wonder
how
a
9
year
active
veteran
would
fail
to
remember
if
he/she
was
informed
of
such
a
possibility
of
longer
retention
at
the
time
of
enlistment
This
lawsuit
has
the
potential
to
get
messy
for
the
DoD
pending
they
are
unable
to
back
up
the
stop-loss

That's
what
your
brother's
mission
is
John
McCaslin's
latest
article
at
TownHall.com
Vision
and
Mission
clears
the
air
for
those
of
you
still
uncertain
as
to
why
someone
you
may
know
and
love
is
off
fighting
a
war
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
President
Bush
came
face-to-face
with
the
sacrifice
and
uncertainty
surrounding
the
war
in
Iraq
during
an
ask
the
president
event
this
week
at
Okaloosa-Walton
College
in
Niceville
Fla
I
have
a
brother
who
served
in
Afghanistan
and
is
going
back
to
Iraq
a
young
woman
stood
up
and
told
the
president
wondering
whether
his
administration
has
a
vision
and
strategy
to
complete
the
mission
That's
a
very
legitimate
question
Bush
replied
And
the
answer
is
we
do
I
just
want
you
to
know
that
your
brother
is
going
on
a
mission
that
has
historic
proportions
to
it
He
then
recalled
a
story
that
I
hope
helps
you
and
helps
everybody
understand
He
said
he
was
sharing
dinner
with
Japanese
Prime
Minister
Junichiro
Koizumi
in
Tokyo
and
thought
it
significant
their
conversation
centered
on
world
peace
Now
the
interesting
part
of
the
story
I
think
as
far
as
your
brother
is
concerned
is
that
during
the
course
of
the
conversation
I
thought
it
was
pretty
neat
to
be
talking
to
a
prime
minister
of
a
country
that
we
had
been
at
war
with
And
that
day
I
was
talking
to
the
head
of
a
former
enemy
and
we're
talking
about
keeping
the
world
more
peaceful
There
were
a
lot
of
people
after
World
War
II
who
did
not
believe
that
Japan
could
be
a
self-governing
peaceful
nation
But
fortunately
our
predecessors
in
the
presidency
and
the
Senate
and
the
Congress
never
forgot
that
fantastic
American
belief
that
freedom
has
the
capacity
to
transform
lives
transform
enemies
to
allies
in
peace
Bush
concluded
by
telling
the
woman
Someday
an
American
president
is
going
to
be
sitting
down
with
an
elected
leader
from
Iraq
huddled
and
talking
about
how
to
keep
the
peace
That's
what
your
brother's
mission
is

Chalk

The

mosque
of
the
Shi'ite
sect
the
Imam
Ali
shrine
occasionally
coming

The
looming
spectre
of

Shi'ite

should
the

be

is
heavy
on
the
minds
of
U.S

The
al-Sadr
militia
is
occupying
the
mosque
waiting
for
just
this
to
occur
Here
we
find
a
perfect
example
of
radical
Islam's
own
indifference

their
supposedly

If
it
so

would
any
Muslim
in
their
right
mind
lure
the
fight
there
knowing
full
well
they
risk
damage
desecration
and
even
total
destruction
of
the
shrine
Like
I
mentioned
previously
they
may
be
trading
up
a
most
holy
site
for
the
blood
of
American
and
Coalition
forces
that
will
surely
be

should
a
Shi'ite
uprising
occur

Iraq
Iran
is
probably

up

with
little

pride
however
misguided
it

Genocide
in

Nah...nothing
goin

or

either
According
to
the

news
wire
an
EU
mission
to
the
Darfur
region
of
Sudan
said
it
had
found
no
evidence
of
genocide
in
the
Sudanese
region
of

although
killing
was
widespread
with
little
evidence
of

The

The
conclusion

put
the

at

with

which
has
leveled
accusations
of

at

burning
by

was

The
hypocrisy
of
liberal
humanitarians
Note
emphasis
mine
When
I
think
about
the
tragedies
of
AIDS
and
abortion
I
wonder
why
so
many
pro-choice
humanitarians
who
want
to
end
the
AIDS
epidemic
are
fighting
so
hard
to
preserve
the
legality
of
abortion
Indeed
I
have
often
heard
liberals
say
that
those
who
are
not
in
favor
of
international
AIDS
relief
are
racists
This
accusation
is
linked
to
the
indisputable
fact
that
those
of
African
descent
are
disproportionately
infected
with
the
disease
But
what
about
the
fact
that
abortions
are
grossly
disproportionately
performed
on
African
American
babies
in
the
United
States
What
is
the
real
reason
why
many
of
those
who
are
fighting
against
AIDS
because
of
the
fact
that
it
gravely
threatens
the
African
population
are
fighting
just
as
vigorously
to
preserve
abortion
despite
the
fact
that
it
gravely
threatens
the
African
American
population
The
answer
to
this
obvious
contradiction
is
simple
It
is
not
stupidity
or
ignorance
of
the
facts
It
is
basic
human
selfishness

additional
bombing
Kerry
said
We
have
to
be
prepared
to
go
the
full
distance
which
is
to
do
everything
possible
to
disrupt
Saddam's
regime
and
to
encourage
the
forces
of
democracy
H]e
can
rebuild
both
chemical
and
biological
And
every
indication
is
because
of
his
deception
and
duplicity
in
the
past
he
will
seek
to
do
that
So
we
will
not
eliminate
the
problem
for
ourselves
or
for
the
rest
of
the
world
with
a
bombing
attack
I
believe
that
in
the
post-Cold
War
period
this
issue
of
proliferation
particularly
in
the
hands
of
Saddam
Hussein
is
critical
Three
months
after
the
9/11
attack
on
our
countrymen
by
state-supported
Jihadi
terrorists
Kerry
argued
Saddam
is
one
who
is
and
has
acted
like
a
terrorist
For
instance
Saddam
Hussein
has
used
weapons
of
mass
destruction
against
his
own
people
He
is
and
has
acted
like
a
terrorist
and
he
has
engaged
in
activities
that
are
unacceptable
Reiterating
his
position
on
Saddam
prior
to
9/11
Kerry
said
I
think
we
ought
to
put
the
heat
on
Saddam
Hussein
I've
said
that
for
a
number
of
years
I
criticized
the
Clinton
administration
for
backing
off
of
the
inspections
He
then
added
I
think
we
need
to
put
the
pressure
on
no
matter
what
the
evidence
is
about
September
11
Regarding
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
Kerry
said
I
think
we
clearly
have
to
keep
the
pressure
on
terrorism
globally
This
doesn't
end
with
Afghanistan
by
any
imagination
And
I
think
the
president
has
made
that
clear
I
think
we
have
made
that
clear
Terrorism
is
a
global
menace
It's
a
scourge
And
it
is
absolutely
vital
that
we
continue
to
combat
terrorism
for
instance
Saddam
Hussein
Regarding
diplomatic
solutions
and
the
Bush
administration's
efforts
to
get
the
UN
to
enforce
the
Security
Council's
unanimous
mandates
on
Iraqi
arms
Kerry
said
in
May
of
2002
Saddam
is
buying
time
and
playing
a
game
in
my
judgment
Do
we
have
to
go
through
that
process
The
answer
is
yes
We're
precisely
doing
that
And
I
think
that's
what
Colin
Powell
did
today
In
July
of
2002
Kerry
told
the
Democrat
Leadership
Council
I
agree
completely
with
this
Administration's
goal
of
a
regime
change
in
Iraq
Saddam
Hussein
is
a
renegade
and
outlaw
who
turned
his
back
on
the
tough
conditions
of
his
surrender
put
in
place
by
the
United
Nations
in
1991
That's
completely
fellow
Patriots
A
month
later
in
a
New
York
Times
op-ed
Kerry
asserted
If
Saddam
Hussein
is
unwilling
to
bend
to
the
international
community's
already
existing
order
then
he
will
have
invited
enforcement
even
if
that
enforcement
is
mostly
at
the
hands
of
the
United
States
a
right
we
retain
even
if
the
Security
Council
fails
to
act
That's
even
if
it's
mostly
at
the
hands
of
the
United
States
In
September
of
2002
a
year
after
9/11
Kerry
said
It
is
imperative
that
we
issue
an
ultimatum
to
Saddam
Hussein
and
that
would
require
immediate
and
full
compliance
and
if
Hussein
doesn't
comply
the
United
States
must
be
prepared
to
go
in
and...if
need
be
largely
alone
remove
Saddam
Hussein
from
power
There
is
also
no
question
that
Saddam
Hussein
continues
to
pursue
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
his
success
can
threaten
both
our
interests
in
the
region
and
our
security
at
home
Saddam
may
even
miscalculate
and
slide
these
WMD
off
to
terrorist
groups
to
invite
them
to
be
a
surrogate
to
use
them
against
the
United
States
It's
the
miscalculation
that
poses
the
greatest
threat
A
few
days
later
he
told
MSNBC
The
president...always
reserves
the
right
to
act
unilaterally
to
protect
the
interests
of
our
country
On
11
October
2002
Kerry
voted
for
the
Iraq
War
Resolution
H.J
Res
114
That's
unilaterally
In
May
of
2003
Kerry
defended
that
vote
saying
I
think
it
was
the
right
decision
to
disarm
Saddam
Hussein
and
when
the
President
made
the
decision
I
supported
him
and
I
support
the
fact
that
we
did
disarm
him
But
when
Howard
Dean
turned
up
the
heat
with
his
anti-war
message
Kerry
began
to
waffle
Announcing
his
candidacy
Kerry's
support
for
regime
change
morphed
into
I
voted
to
threaten
the
use
of
force
to
make
Saddam
Hussein
comply
with
the
resolutions
of
the
United
Nations
Notice
the
head
of
the
pin
on
which
Kerry
is
now
attempting
to
dance
He's
claiming
that
he
only
voted
to
threaten
the
use
of
force
In
other
words
he's
now
insisting
that
he
only
voted
to
deliver
a
hollow
threat
Not
exactly
a
profile
in
courage
eh
As
the
Demo-primary
season
approached
Kerry
began
to
hone
his
newfound
opposition
to
the
removal
of
Saddam
They
rushed
to
war
They
were
intent
on
going
to
war
When
it
came
time
to
provide
supplemental
appropriations
for
our
troops
in
Iraq
Kerry
who
planned
to
run
his
campaign
on
his
veteran
status
claimed
I
don't
think
any
United
States
senator
is
going
to
abandon
our
troops
and
recklessly
leave
Iraq
to
whatever
follows
as
a
result
of
simply
cutting
and
running
That's
irresponsible
I
don't
think
anyone
in
the
Congress
is
going
to
not
give
our
troops
ammunition
not
give
our
troops
the
ability
to
be
able
to
defend
themselves
We're
not
going
to
cut
and
run
and
not
do
the
job
But
on
17
October
2003
Kerry
abandoned
our
troops
voting
against
S
1689
the
Emergency
Supplemental
Appropriations
for
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
Security
and
Reconstruction
Thus
he
put
pure
political
expedience
ahead
of
his
obligation
to
arm
and
equip
our
fighting
forces
specifically
those
fighting
forces
currently
standing
in
harm's
way
In
January
of
this
year
when
asked
if
he
was
one
of
the
anti-war
candidates
Kerry
answered
firmly
I
am
yeah
After
announcing
his
running
mate
in
March
he
said
of
John
Edwards
I'm
proud
to
say
that
John
joined
me
in
voting
against
that
87
billion
Got
that
He's
actually
proud
of
having
stiffed
our
troops
Last
month
when
asked
by
CBS
if
his
vote
for
the
removal
of
Saddam
was
a
mistake
which
politically
it
clearly
was
Kerry
fumbled
his
answer
What
what
what
I
voted
for
you
you
you
see
you're
playing
here
What
what
I
voted
for
was
a
an
authority
for
the
president
to
go
to
war
as
a
last
resort
if
Saddam
Hussein
did
not
disarm
and
we
needed
to
go
to
war
When
pressed
for
a
direct
answer
to
the
question
Kerry
responded
curtly
I
think
I
answered
your
question
When
asked
why
he
voted
for
the
war
but
didn't
vote
for
the
money
to
finance
the
war
Kerry
responded
That's
not
a
flip-flop
That's
not
a
flip-flop
And
this
week
Kerry
claims
I
believe
this
administration
is
actually
encouraging
the
recruitment
of
terrorists
The
policies
of
this
administration
I
believe
and
others
believe
very
deeply
have
resulted
in
an
increase
of
animosity
and
anger
focused
on
the
United
States
of
America
Here
we
suppose
others
is
in
reference
to
the
same
yet-to-be-identified
foreign
leaders
who
Kerry
claims
support
his
candidacy
The
reality
is
of
course
that
it's
our
very
existence
and
not
our
actions
that
the
Jihadis
really
object
to
Kerry's
failure
to
acknowledge
this
fact
is
indicative
of
just
how
deeply
he
has
delved
into
the
fevered
swamp
Last
week
greeting
Demo-conventioneers
with
a
limp
Clintonesque
salute
Kerry
intoned
that
he
was
reporting
for
duty
To
which
we
say
it's
about
time
because
he
has
been
AWOL
from
Iraq
since
he
voted
to
invade

Think
domestic
violence
is
a
social
disease
native
only
to
the
United
States
Think
again
I
would
be
very
interested
in
seeing
a
report
sometime
in
the
future
comparing
and
analyzing
the
similar
characteristics
between
domestic
violence
in
Chinese
and
American
societies
Much
could
be
learned
from
such
a
study
The
following
are
exerpts
from
this
sobering
article
sic
tens
of
millions
perhaps
hundreds
of
millions
of
Chinese
women
are
regularly
abused
by
their
husbands
or
partners
experts
say
Wife
beating
and
alarming
female
suicide
rates
have
been
well
documented
in
China's
remote
dirt-poor
villages
But
experts
say
young
cosmopolitan
women
sic
are
increasingly
falling
victim
to
domestic
violence
as
they
bear
the
brunt
of
unprecedented
social
upheaval
sweeping
the
country
spurred
by
an
economy
galloping
at
more
than
9
percent
a
year
In
a
bizarre
twist
many
women
even
say
their
status
in
society
has
been
eroded
as
economic
reforms
unleashed
20
years
ago
cast
aside
the
last
vestiges
of
Maoism
under
which
women
were
famously
told
they
hold
up
half
the
sky
Wang
Simei
said
the
level
of
violence
in
domestic
assault
cases
has
increased
According
to
a
recent
survey
by
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Social
Sciences
as
many
as
one-third
of
women
in
270
million
households
across
the
country
have
been
victims
of
domestic
violence
Researchers
say
surveys
often
understate
the
problem
because
many
women
are
unwilling
to
lose
face
by
admitting
even
anonymously
that
they
have
been
beaten
In
traditional
Chinese
society
family
strife
is
considered
best
kept
from
the
public
Whatever
the
true
number
experts
agree
domestic
violence
has
become
more
common
as
China
moves
toward
a
market
economy
throwing
millions
of
people
out
of
jobs
and
ushering
in
a
return
to
the
more
traditional
values
that
preceded
communist
rule
Domestic
violence
has
gotten
worse
said
Ren
Yuan
a
professor
at
Shanghai's
Fudan
University
who
studies
women's
issues
People
are
more
stressed
We
all
feel
this
China
is
changing
very
quickly
too
fast
for
social
support
services
and
the
law

Oh
my
Driving
home
at
2am
and
not
quite
awake
enough
for
the
usual
rock
radio
I
turned
the
dial
to
a
local
AM
station
On
it
I
was
surprised
to
hear
a
live
talk
radio
show
at
this
hour
of
the
night
I
caught
the
tail
end
of
the
discussion
with
the
guest
Scott
Gulbransen
who
seemed
to
be
an
educated
guy
talking
about
the
what
he
called
a
schizophrenic
national
security/counter-terrorism
policy
the
U.S
is
currently
engaging
He
brought
up
an
interesting
point
at
the
end
of
the
show
about
how
the
Russian
high-tech
mafia
was
making
a
killing
by
selling
leftover
stockpile
nuclear
goodies
after
the
break-up
of
the
U.S.S.R
on
the
black
market
to
interested
terrorists
throughout
the
nineties
Suitcase
nukes
are
not
that
difficult
to
acquire
these
days
so
it
was
a
valid
assertion
Being
the
fan
of
checking
credentials
that
I
am
I
discovered
Mr
Gulbransen
has
a
colorful
resume
for
an
author
of
a
book
on
terrorists
crossing
the
border
Upon
learning
of
his
impressive
background
as
a
Manager
of
Corporate
Communications
with
the
TurboTax
software
company
and
as
a
Media
Relations
Assistant/Marketing
Manager
for
the
University
of
Nevada
Las
Vegas
athletic
department
for
4
years
I
figured
this
guy
had
to
know
what
he
was
talking
about...especially
since
he
also
mentioned
he's
conferred
with
numerous
friends
from
the
FBI
CIA
Border
Patrol
etc
etc
on
these
issues
as
well
In
fact
three
of
the
four
people
who
read
his
book
praised
it
as
a
wonderful
piece
of
fiction...er...non-fiction
One
reader
read
both
the
first
and
second
editions
But
enough
debasing
of
the
poor
guy
After
all
he's
probably
just
trying
to
make
a
buck
in
the
private
sector
by
playing
on
the
insecurities
of
America
right
The
way
this
guy
was
dropping
references
on
the
show
left
and
right
about
all
of
the
acquaintances/contacts
from
the
Feds
he's
spoken
with
on
the
matters
really
had
me
convinced
he
was
some
long
time
former
20-year
veteran
with
the
FBI
spilling
what
he
was
cleared
to
say
about
how
screwed
we
are
I
shudder
to
think
of
what
will
happen
when
I
am
proved
right
and
our
nation
gets
off
its
collective
ass
and
does
something
about
it
After
hearing
of
how
once
Department
of
Homeland
Security
Secretary
Tom
Ridge
retires/resigns
and
enters
the
private
sector
perhaps
as
a
security
consultant
for
some
large
corporation
he
will
be
making
boku
bucks
literally
in
the
millions
I
figured
this
guy
was
playing
the
same
hand
Did
I
mention
he's
a
former
radio
play-by-play
sports
broadcaster
for
UNLV
b-ball
football
and
baseball
However
to
be
fair
he
did
have
some
rather
valid
comments
and
assertions
regarding
the
rise
of
Leftism
in
Latin
America
and
its
impact
on
the
U.S
The
following
are
excerpts
from
an
interview
with
Ryan
Mauro
of
http://www.worldthreats.com
WRM
What
are
the
implications
of
the
common
trend
among
US
companies
of
hiring
immigrants
from
countries
some
of
us
see
as
potential
enemies
like
China
the
former
Soviet
republics
and
Russia
etc
SG
The
ramifications
of
moving
all
of
our
manufacturing
jobs
overseas
are
unknown
but
in
my
view
it
cannot
be
good
If
an
international
war
or
incident
broke
out
we
wouldn't
be
able
to
produce
enough
goods
and
services
at
home
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
overseas
resources
In
reality
we're
all
giving
up
economic
freedom
so
we
can
buy
items
at
Wal-Mart
for
less
than
we
can
elsewhere
We're
selling
our
souls
to
save
a
few
bucks
WRM
How
do
you
respond
to
the
allegations
that
sightings
of
Asians
in
Mexican
military
uniforms
may
just
be
soldiers
of
the
Indian
population
usually
found
in
the
southern
portion
of
Mexico
SG
I
think
the
allegations
that
many
make
of
the
Asians
being
Native
Mexicans
is
a
smoke
screen
If
you're
going
to
sit
there
and
tell
me
that
Border
Patrol
agents
and
Customs
officers
don't
know
the
difference
between
those
Mexicans
and
Asians
I'll
say
your
nuts
These
men
and
women
deal
with
Mexican
Indians
all
the
time
they
know
the
difference
These
are
not
sightings
by
tourists
or
unqualified
people
They
are
on
the
border
every
day
and
round
up
illegal
immigrants
all
the
time
To
say
they
are
mistaken
questions
their
intelligence
and
is
just
another
way
to
ignore
the
possibility
that
this
is
really
happening
WRM
Are
these
foreign
units
possibly
helping
the
Marxist
anti-American
rebel
movements
in
Mexico
particularly
in
the
south
such
as
the
Zapatistas
or
are
being
used
to
assist
officials
seen
as
favorable
by
governments
seeking
to
undermine
American
power
SG
Absolutely
These
Marxist
elements
are
on
the
rise
in
Mexico
AND
America
The
recent
peace
protests
over
the
Iraq
War
was
a
clear
sign
that
Communism
is
back
strong
in
the
Western
Hemisphere
and
they
are
making
inroads
We
are
being
undermined
internally
daily
and
Mexico
and
its
revolutionaries
are
aiding
and
abetting
Whoaa
now...hold
up
I
HARDLY
think
a
small
isolated
indigenous
insurgency
fighting
for
self-autonomy
in
the
depths
of
Chiapas
Mexico
are
playing
a
significant
part
if
any
at
all
in
aiding
and
abetting
a
communist
effort
to
undermine
American
national
security
As
a
self-professed
Latin
Americanist
who
has
studied
individuals/groups
like
Subcomandante
Marcos
and
the
EZLN
throughout
my
college
career
again
I
hardly
consider
them
a
threat
to
the
States...masked
guerrillas
hiding
in
the
highlands
with
obsolete
weapons
and
all
It
would
be
far
too
extensive
a
discussion
to
explain
the
rise
of
socialist/Marxist
populism
throughout
several
Latin
American
nations
like
Brazil
Venezuela
and
Ecuador
here
Its
implications
to
American
security
are
by
far
more
accurately
described
as
a
long
and
steady
growing
negative
socio-political
reaction
to
the
economic
oppression
of
neo-liberal
free
trade
market
reforms
imposed...er....implemented
in
the
early
1980s
and
beyond
And
on
the
assertion
that
the
recent
peace
protests
over
the
Iraq
War
was
a
clear
sign
that
Communism
is
back
strong
in
the
Western
Hemisphere"...c'mon..give
me
a

protester
I'll

victims
of
the

From
Here
to

Tora
Tora
Tora
In
Harm's
Way
These
are
three
films
made
about
Pearl
Harbor
There
have
been
more
than
20
films
made
about
Pearl
Harbor
and
over
200
films
made
about
World
War
II
These
films
inspire
patriotism
courage
and
nationalism
They
tell
us
about
the
honor
and
bravery
of
the
soldiers
and
the
nation
that
supported
them
Two
and
a
half
years
after
the
attack
on
Pearl
Harbor
the
world
watched
American
forces
fight
on
D-Day
Two
and
a
half
years
after
the
Sept
11
terrorist
attacks
the
world
is
watching
Michael
Moore's
Fahrenheit
9/11
Moore's
film
is
the
first
major
motion
picture
about
Sept
11
2001
This
bears
repeating
When
future
generations
look
back
on
the
Sept
11
massacre
their
first
impression
through
the
medium
of
film
will
be
a
work
in
which
the
president
and
the
government
are
blamed
for
the
attacks
and
the
soldiers
who
are
protecting
this
country
are
defamed
Instead
of
a
film
version
of
Lisa
Beamer's
book
Let's
Roll
or
Richard
Picciotto's
Last
Man
Down
we
are
presented
with
this
fallacy
How
could
this
happen
It
would
be
a
colossal
insult
to
insinuate
that
Franklin
D
Roosevelt
or
the
U.S
government
were
in
any
way
responsible
for
the
attacks
on
Pearl
Harbor
Can
you
imagine
the
indignation
of
the
men
and
women
who
lived
during
that
period
Fahrenheit
9/11
is
indicative
of
a
nation
that
has
become
too
apathetic
ignorant
or
deceived
to
face
the
enemy
at
the
gate
America
where
is
your
fury
On
Sept
11
2001
I
stood
across
the
Hudson
River
watching
the
Twin
Towers
burn
knowing
that
if
the
plane
had
struck
at
9:46
a.m
instead
of
8:46
a.m
I
would
be
dead
As
a
survivor
and
witness
to
the
attack
on
the
World
Trade
Center
I
am
more
than
insulted
by
this
film
I
am
outraged
This
film
is
based
on
conjecture
hearsay
and
propaganda
At
a
time
when
this
country
desperately
needs
to
rally
in
support
of
our
brave
soldiers
and
our
strong
leaders
Moore
is
content
to
spread
discord
and
divisiveness
The
base
of
his
argument
is
that
the
Bush
administration
had
strong
ties
with
the
bin
Laden
family
However
sound
facts
are
conspicuously
absent
from
this
documentary
The
9/11
commission
did
not
indict
President
Bush
According
to
the
report
the
president's
actions
before
during
and
after
the
attacks
are
fully
justified
including
the
military
action
in
Iraq
The
commission
did
not
find
a
direct
link
between
Saddam
Hussein's
Iraq
and
the
Sept
11
terrorist
attacks
A
similar
commission
in
the
1940s
would
not
have
found
a
direct
link
between
Hitler's
Germany
and
the
attack
on
Pearl
Harbor
In
both
instances
the
threat
was
imminent
the
president
and
the
military
acted
decisively
Could
we
have
been
more
prepared
for
a
terrorist
attack
on
Sept
10
2001
Certainly
Could
we
have
been
more
prepared
for
an
attack
on
Dec
6
1941
Most
definitely
In
the
weeks
and
months
following
Pearl
Harbor
there
were
reports
and
criticisms
that
the
government
and
military
should
have
been
more
prepared
The
difference
is
that
the
people
of
the
nation
did
not
waste
a
lot
of
time
pointing
fingers
at
each
other
Rather
they
unified
and
engaged
the
enemy
head-on
I
guess
that
is
why
we
call
them
The
Greatest
Generation
How
will
future
generations
refer
to
us
So
how
do
we
explain
Moore's
film
to
future
generations
I
wonder
More
than
that
I
wonder
how
I
would
explain
this
film
to
Nancy
D
Jerome
N
or
Heather
H
I
am
sure
you
don't
know
their
names
but
their
faces
haunt
me
day
and
night
How
would
I
explain
to
them
that
a
film
was
made
accusing
the
president
and
vilifying
the
soldiers
the
same
president
and
soldiers
who
are
attempting
to
avenge
their
murders
and
protect
other
citizens
Moore
has
not
only
insulted
the
nation
he
has
insulted
the
victims
of
the
terrorist
attacks
During
his
acceptance
speech
at
the
Oscars
Moore
said
Shame
on
you
Mr
Bush
Well
I
say
Shame
on
you
Michael
Moore
Shame
on
everyone
who
supports
this
travesty
of
a
film
Shame
on
a
society
that
allows
this
sham
of
a
film
You
have
weakened
the
nation

a

point
by

comments

from

to

the

The
complete
speech
in
its
entirety
can

here
at
Newsday
A
few
of
you
may
be
surprised
to
see
someone
with
my
last
name
showing
up
to
speak
at
a
Democratic
convention
Let
me
assure
you
I
am
not
here
to
make
a
political
speech
and
the
topic
at
hand
should
not
must
not
have
anything
to
do
with
partisanship
No
RJ
actually
I'm
not
surprised
you
were
part
of
the
lineup
for

Reinvention
tour
You've
actively
opposed
and
stood
against
every
single
issue
value
and
objective
of
your
father's
party
the
GOP
Nah
nothing
partisan
about
taking
a
firm
stance
on
a
controversial
medical
procedure
that
Bush
so
happens
to
have
the
counter-position
just
to
spite
him
You
truly
cared
for
and
respected
your
father
wholeheartedly
growing
up
throughout
his
bout
with
Alzheimer's
till
his
dying
day
You
are
the
ideal
spokesperson
for
the
Alzheimer's
Foundation
of
America
insert
sarcasm
here
How'd
you
like
to
have
your
own
personal
biological
repair
kit
standing
by
at
the
hospital
Sound
like
magic
Welcome
to
the
future
of
medicine
By
the
way
no
fetal
tissue
is
involved
in
this
process
No
fetuses
are
created
none
destroyed
This
all
happens
in
the
laboratory
at
the
cellular
level
Oh
thanks
for
clearing
the
fog
on
this
issue...I
thought
embryonic
stem
cell
research
involved
human
embryos...thanks
for
scientifically
establishing
that
it
only
occurs
on
the
cellular
level
Now
there
are
those
who
would
stand
in
the
way
of
this
remarkable
future
who
would
deny
the
federal
funding
so
crucial
to
basic
research
They
argue
that
interfering
with
the
development
of
even
the
earliest
stage
embryo
even
one
that
will
never
he
implanted
in
a
womb
and
will
never
develop
into
an
actual
fetus
is
tantamount
to
murder
A
few
of
these
folks
needless
to
say
are
just
grinding
a
political
axe
and
they
should
he
ashamed
of
themselves
But
many
are
well-meaning
and
sincere
Their
belief
is
just
that
an
article
of
faith
and
they
are
entitled
to
it
But
it
does
not
follow
that
the
theology
of
a
few
should
be
allowed
to
forestall
the
health
and
well-being
of
the
many
And
how
can
we
affirm
life
if
we
abandon
those
whose
own
lives
are
so
desperately
at
risk

head
I'm
not

John
Kerry's
daughter
just
shared
a
lil
anecdote
about
how
as
children
they
once
joked
that
Poppa
Kerry
was
6'4
and
6'6
with
the
hair
Well
I'd
say
more
like
7'0
with
the
nose
when
he
looks
to
the
sky
literally
the
shnozz
or
figuratively
the
Pinocchio
beak
with
the
oh-so-many
flip-floppin
lies

Hidden
Heroism
It
was
an
impossible
mission
Fly
a
helicopter
2,000
miles
roundtrip
in
a
nor'easter
to
save
the
crew
of
a
sunken
freighter
A
mission
of
this
magnitude
had
never
been
attempted
before
Could
a
few
brave
men
from
the
air
national
guard
pull
it
off
BY
COLONEL
EDWARD
L
FLEMING
Alright
this
guy
Colonel
Fleming
went
ridiculously
above
and
beyond
the
call
of
duty
to
rescue
a
drowning
Ukrainian
freight
sailor
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
While
tredding
water
and
watching
his
fellow
crew
being
gouged
by
sharks
the
lone
sailor
was
carefully
lifted
from
the
sea
by
the
Air
National
Guard
This
was
truly
a
historic
undertaking
never
before
attempted
And
why
do
we
never
hear
of
such
gallant
deeds
in
the
daily
media
It
sure
isn't
because
positive
military
coverage
is
the
norm
To
read
more
of
this
story
make
sure
to
pick
up
a
copy
of
the
June
issue
of
Men's
Journal
If
you
want
the
real
deal
order
a
copy
of
Fleming's
Heart
of
the
Storm
My
Adventures
as
a
Helicopter
Rescue
Pilot
and

online
at
Amazon.com
or

or

if
that

That

did
me

start
wooing
me
with
the
grand
vision
of
reuniting
his
and
Kerry's
multimillionaire
America
with
the
rest
of
us
Perhaps
it
was
the
Southern
twang
or
the
51-year-old
boyish
charm
Or
maybe
it
was
the
recanting
of
the
difficult
days
his
family
endured
in
a
coal-mining
town
Either
way
somewhere
between
Family
Guy
and
Leno
I
zogged
out
at
the

until
3am
So
y'all

such

that

do
what

no

Tony
the
Tiger
sets
the
record
straight
No
one
lied
No
one
made
up
the
intelligence
No
one
inserted
things
into
the
dossier
against
the
advice
of
the
intelligence
services
Everyone
genuinely
tried
to
do
their
best
in
good
faith
for
the
country
in
circumstances
of
acute
difficulty
That
issue
of
good
faith
should
now
be
at
an
end
But
I
have
to
accept
as
the
months
have
passed
it
seems
increasingly
clear
that
at
the
time
of
invasion
Saddam
did
not
have
stockpiles
of
chemical
or
biological
weapons
ready
to
deploy
I
have
searched
my
conscience
not
in
the
spirit
of
obstinacy
but
in
genuine
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
what
we
now
know
in
answer
to
that
question
And
my
answer
would
be
that
the
evidence
of
Saddam's
WMD
was
indeed
less
certain
less
well-founded
than
was
stated
at
the
time
But
I
cannot
go
from
there
to
the
opposite
extreme
On
any
basis
he
retained
complete
strategic
intent
on
WMD
and
significant
capability
The
only
reason
he
ever
let
the
inspectors
back
into
Iraq
was
that
he
had
180,000
US
and
British
troops
on
his
doorstep
Had
we
backed
down
in
respect
of
Saddam
we
would
never
have
taken
the
stand
we
needed
to
take
on
WMD
never
have
got
progress
on
Libya
and
we
would
have
left
Saddam
in
charge
of
Iraq
with
every
malign
intent
and
capability
still
in
place
and
every
dictator
with
the
same
intent
everywhere
immeasurably
emboldened
But
I
cannot
honestly
say
I
believe
getting
rid
of
Saddam
was
a
mistake
at
all
