Go
Maybe
I'm
wrong
maybe
John
McCain
has
a
shot
in
PA
A
new
poll
has
Obama
only
up
by
4
in
PA
with
9
undecided
I
still
think
it's
unlikely
but
if
you're
a
New
Yorker
and
want
to
go
to
PA
to
help
out
this
weekend
contact
me
and
I'll
help
make
that
happen

Song
of
the
Day
Breakdown
by
Guns-n-Roses
When
asked
my
favorite
band
I
always
say
GNR
Over
the
years
the
answer
might
be
GNR
and
the
Lemonheads
or
GNR
and
Pulp
but
GNR
is
the
constant
always
the
band
I
love
most
What's
most
amazing
to
me
about
GNR
is
the
length
of
time
that
I
have
loved
them
second
most
amazing
thing
is
that
they
only
had
3
full
length
albums
an
ep
and
a
cover
album
and
it's
been
enough
to
sustain
my
love
Appetite
for
Destruction
came
out
in
1987
I
was
ten
Use
Your
Illusion
I
and
II
came
out
in
1991
and
I
remember
being
14
and
on
a
cruise
with
my
parents
listening
to
14
Years
as
if
it
were
about
me
I
remember
Breakdown
speaking
to
me
at
that
age
but
it's
hard
to
imagine
how
I
always
particularly
liked
the
first
verse
We
all
come
in
from
the
cold
We
come
down
from
the
wire
And
everybody
warms
themselves
to
a
different
fire
But
sometimes
we
get
burned
You'd
think
sometime
we'd
learn
The
one
you
love
is
the
one
that
should
take
you
higher
You
ain't
got
no
one
You
better
go
back
out
and
find
em
Anyway
if
it's
possible
to
be
one
of
the
biggest
rock
bands
of
all
time
only
have
like
3
1/2
albums
and
yet
still
have
songs
that
could
be
considered
undiscovered
I
would
nominate
Breakdown
for
that
honor
Locomotive
might
be
a
close
second

Thoughts
on
the
election
while
I
procrastinate
on
doing
8
other
things
I
agree
with
Peter
Feld
and
Dick
Morris
both
of
whom
sidenote
trivia
taught
me
in
grad
school
that
the
undecideds
will
break
for
McCain
No
it's
not
that
they
are
racists
just
that
this
race
has
become
the
election
of
Obama
or
not-Obama
and
my
sense
is
undecideds
usually
go
for
the
anti
vote
I'm
not
sure
there
are
enough
of
them
at
this
point
to
make
a
difference
nationally
but
they
may
on
a
state-by-state
basis
Real
Clear
Politics
has
Obama
up
by
4
in
Florida
and
6
in
Ohio
Those
numbers
might
be
the
margin
of
undecided
voters
which
obviously
is
McCain's
best
case
scenario
Of
course
if
he
loses
Virginia
and
Colorado
as
it
appears
he
will
none
of
this
matters
anyway
I've
said
it
before
I'll
say
it
again
forget
about
Pennsylvania
Making
Obama
spend
money
there
wasn't
the
worst
idea
ever
but
in
these
last
few
days
before
we
choose
our
next
president
McCain's
campaign
should
surrender
the
fantasy
completely
that
some
disgruntled
white
boys
in
Pennsylvania
are
going
to
lead
some
kind
of
rebellion
and
take
down
Obama
They're
not
Is
it
over
Mostly
But
there's
a
reason
we
still
have
an
election
day
despite
all
the
polls
If
you
care
about
who
will
win
get
out
and
vote
and
bring
others
with
you
The
only
people
who
matter
are
the
ones
voting
The
people
answering
the
phone
and
giving
their
opinion
to
a
pollster
just
don't

We'll
know
at
6pm
on
election
day
if
we
don't
know
already
Apparently
polls
in
Indiana
close
at
the
absurd
time
of
6pm
EST
Indiana
usually
a
reliable
Republican
state
Bush
won
it
twice
by
about
20
points
has
Obama
leading
in
the
polls
there
If
Obama
wins
Indiana
it's
likely
been
a

Oooooooooooh
Ohhhhhhhh
Buuuuuuuuuuurn
Sorry
I'm
just
imitating
giddy
liberals
every
time
anyone
remotely
connected
to
Republicans
endorses
Obama
Former
Obama
speechwriter
endorses
McCain
Having
worked
in
politics
I
know
that
absolutely
none
of
this
is
on
the
level
This
back
and
forth
is
posturing
a
charade
and
a
political
game
These
lines
are
what
I
refer
to
as
hooker
lines??a
sure
thing
to
get
applause
and
the
press
to
scribble
as
if
they?re
reporting
meaningful
news
As
the
nation
slouches
toward
disaster
the
level
of
political
discourse
is
unworthy
of
this
moment
in
history
We
have
Republicans
raising
Ayers
and
Democrats
fostering
ageism
with
erratic
and
jokes
about
Depends
Sexism
Racism
Ageism
and
maybe
some
Socialism
have
all
made
their
ugly
cameos
in
election
2008
It?s
not
inspiring
Perhaps
this
is
why
I
found
the
initial
mocking
of
Joe
so
offensive
and
I
realized
an
old
line
applied
I
didn?t
leave
the
Democratic
Party
the
Democratic
Party
left
me
The
party
I
believed
in
wouldn?t
look
down
on
working
people
under
any
circumstance
And
Joe
the
Plumber
is
right
This
is
the
absolutely
worst
time
to
raise
taxes
on
anyone
the
rich
the
middle
class
the
poor
small
businesses
and
corporations

You're
rich
and
you
didn't
even
know
it
Remember
when
Obama
was
only
going
to
raise
taxes
on
those
who
made
over
250,000
a
year
Except
for
that
time
that
he
slipped
and
said
200,000
And
that
other
time
that
Biden
used
the
figure
150,000
Taxing
just
the
rich
is
complicated
stuff
when
the
definition
of
rich
keeps
changing
John
McCain
is
hitting
Obama
on
this
but
just
like
with
everything
McCain
does
at
this
point
it
might
be
too
little
too
late
Senator
Obama
has
made
a
lot
of
promises
First
he
said
people
making
less
than
250,000
dollars
would
benefit
from
his
plan
then
this
weekend
he
announced
in
an
ad
that
if
you're
a
family
making
less
than
200,000
dollars
you'll
benefit
but
yesterday
right
here
in
Pennsylvania
Senator
Biden
said
tax
relief
should
only
go
to
middle
class
people
people
making
under
150,000
dollars
a
year
It's
interesting
how
their
definition
of
rich
has
a
way
of
creeping
down
At
this
rate
it
won't
be
long
before
Senator
Obama
is
right
back
to
his
vote
that
Americans
making
just
42,000
dollars
a
year
should
get
a
tax
increase
We
can't
let
that
happen

Song
of
the
Day
Change
by
Blind
Melon
I
was
just
talking
about
Blind
Melon
and
then
this
song
was
played
in
the
Entourage
episode
yesterday
They
were
one
of
the
few
bands
I
saw
up
close
during
Woodstock
1994
Yes
I
went
to
Woodstock
1994
not
the
violent
1999
one
It
might've
been
the
over-commercialized
capitalistic
version
of
Woodstock
but
it
was
one
of
the
best
weekends
I've
ever
had
My
two
city
friends
and
I
drove
up
she
carrying
a
down
blanket
and
pillow
him
with
a
plan
to
drink
all
weekend
I
had
bought
a
sleeping
bag
at
Toys-r-Us
in
anticipation
of
the
trip
I'd
seen
the
movies
people
brought
sleeping
bags
to
this
sort
of
thing
Needless
to
say
none
of
us
had
ever
been
camping
Funny
side
story
of
something
happened
that
weekend
I
hit
a
state
trooper
with
my
car
tapped
really
when
I
misunderstood
her
hand
signals
and
literally
drove
my
car
very
slowly
into
her
She
started
screaming
at
me
calling
me
a
bitch
telling
me
to
get
out
of
the
car
asking
me
if
I
was
drunk
No
just
17
and
really
wanting
to
hear
some
tunes
maaaaan
She
had
her
male
trooper
come
over
and
talk
to
me
He
was
all
business
license
and
registration
and
if
you've
been
drinking
you're
going
to
JAIL
Apparently
I
wasn't
moving
fast
enough
because
he
screamed
LICENSE
AND
REGISTRATION
NOW
in
my
ear
With
shaking
hands
I
pulled
out
my
license
as
my
friends
watched
from
the
car
He
looked
at
it
and
said
you
live
in
Long
Beach
I
live
in
Island
Park
Oh
Long
Beach
how
I
love
thee
He
let
me
go
After
all
I
was
a
nice
girl
from
Long
Beach
and
not
from
Brooklyn
or
somewhere
equally
unpalatable
I
get
a
lot
of
flack
3
at
the
link
from
people
close
to
me
for
making
friends
everywhere
I
go
but
in
general
this
has
only
helped
me
in
my
life
That
weekend
I
ran
into
some
childhood
friends
who
shared
their
tent
with
us
when
it
rained
for
3
straight
days
I
heard
nary
a
complaint
about
my
making
friends
with
everybody
It
was
a
completely
crazy
awesome
incredible
time
The
bands
I
remember
seeing
up
close
were
Metallica
NIN
Cypress
Hill
and
Blind
Melon
Shannon
Hoon
Blind
Melon's
lead
singer
a
man
was
wearing
a
dress
and
he
seemed
crazy
But
they
put
on
a
hell
of
a
show
Shannon
has
since
died
overdose
I
guess
he
didn't
really
believe
things
could
change
Lyrics
from
Change
are
inscribed
on
his
grave
Earlier
that
year
my
best
friend
Laurie
and
I
had
petitioned
to
make
Change
our
senior
prom
song
The
powers
that
be
picked
This
is
the
time
by
Billy
Joel
instead
We
still
think
this
would've
been
a
better
choice

reviews
two
children's
books
about
Barack
Obama
The
authors
of
two
recent
children's
picture
books
detailing
the
life
Barack
Obama
have
taken
this
classical
Greek
advice
to
heart
turning
Hillary
Clinton's
classic
mockery
Celestial
choruses
will
be
singing
and
everyone
will
know
we
should
do
the
right
thing
and
the
world
will
be
perfect
into
the
straight-faced
official
biography
for
the
four
to
seven
year-old
set
Here
for
example
is
how
Jonah
Winter
striking
a
tone
in
BARACK
somewhere
between
Vladimir
Lenin
and
action
movie
preview
narrator
translates
the
presidential
race
for
America's
impressionable
babes
O]n
the
horizon
at
the
dawn
of
a
new
age
there
appeared
a
man
who
would
be
the
embodiment
of
King's
dream
a
presidential
candidate
whose
very
being
was
a
bridge
that
joined
nations
Not
to
be
outdone
Nikki
Grimes
Son
of
Promise
Child
of
Hope
describes
the
early
years
of
Barack
his
mama
white
as
whipped
cream
his
daddy
black
as
ink
thusly
He
was
there
in
Chicago
because
he
cared
about
these
people
They
were
his
family
People
in
Kenya
were
his
family
Indonesians
were
his
family
And
no
matter
where
he
was
the
world
was
his
home
And
who
he
was
could
be
summed
up
in
one
word
loveable
Well
at
least
she
doesn't
say
Messiah
Like
I
noted
in
an
earlier
post
and
many
of
you
disagreed
it
will
not
be
possible
for
Obama's
public
to
keep
up
this
level
of
adoration
should
he
actually
become
president
This
worship
is
usually
reserved
for
G-d
family
heroes
and
not
a
man
who
can
deliver
a
good
speech
If
you're
not
sickened
you're
not
paying
attention

Everybody's
linking
it
Charles
Krauthammer
has
the
McCain
endorsement
This
is
my
favorite
part
I
stand
athwart
the
rush
of
conservative
ship-jumpers
of
every
stripe
neo
Ken
Adelman
moderate
Colin
Powell
genetic/ironic
Christopher
Buckley
and
socialist/atheist
Christopher
Hitchens
yelling
Stop
I
shall
have
no
part
of
this
motley
crew
I
will
go
down
with
the
McCain
ship
I'd
rather
lose
an
election
than
lose
my
bearings
First
I'll
have
no
truck
with
the
phony
case
ginned
up
to
rationalize
voting
for
the
most
liberal
and
inexperienced
presidential
nominee
in
living
memory
That's
right
no
truck
And
the
socialist/atheist
conservative
line
is
funny
too
He
does
a
pretty
good
job
explaining
why
McCain
is
superior
to
Obama
if
you're
into
that
sort
of
thing
with
just
a
few
days
left
until
the
election
I'm
unconvinced
that
there
are
really
any
undecided
voters
left

Welcome
to
NYC
Two
public
referendums
in
the
1990's
established
term
limits
for
the
NY
City
Council
and
NY's
mayor
In
2008
in
a
vote
of
29-22
the
City
Council
decided
that
the
opinion
of
the
voters
was
actually
wrong
and
overturned
those
limits
Azi
notes
The
people
voting
on
it
were
the
51
members
of
the
City
Council
35
of
whom
were
being
forced
out
of
office
because
of
term
limits
I'm
happy
to
report
that
all
three
Republicans
on
the
Council
voted
against
this
atrocity

Don't

My

that
it's

I
consider
myself
a
strong
reader
of

and
something
about
her

just
doesn't
seem
right
They're
laughing
eyes
not

But
like
I

section
if
it's

I'm

Song

Public
Service
Announcement
by
Jay-Z
Listen
to
it
here
I've
been
on
a
big
Jay-Z
kick
ever
since
the
realization
that
he's
the
best
living
rapper
and
this
is
one
of
those
songs
that
when
it
comes
on
my
ipod
I
basically
start
bouncing
as
I
walk
And
then
I
text
Dawn
random
lyrics
from
the
song
No
matter
where
you
go
you
are
what
you
are
player
And
you
can
try
to
change
but
that's
just
the
top
layer
You
was
who
you
was
when
you
got
here
And
she
writes
back
you
really
was
You
really
was
Also
check
out
the
acapella
and

Grey
album

mix

album
and

Tell
me

your
favorite
song
is
right
this
minute
UPDATE
I'm
sorry
did
that
sound
threatening
and
that's
why
no
one
is
commenting
I
meant
tell
me
what
you're
listening
to
at
the
moment
because
I'd
like
some
musical
suggestions

Sciency
I
don't
know
why
I
found
myself
reading
this
article
about
whether
a
woman's
weight
during
pregnancy
can
affect
the
political
outlook
of
her
future
baby
but
then
I
thought
to
myself
wait
I
have
a
blog
I
don't
have
to
suffer
through
this
alone
The
money
part
indeed
the
only
part
of
the
article
having
to
do
with
obesity
or
voting
instead
of
just
saying
that
hormones
have
an
effect
on
our
bodies
is
this
So
far
so
intriguing
But
what
does
any
of
it
have
to
do
with
obesity
Possibly
nothing
But
one
additional
observation
suggests
there
could
be
a
connection
Obese
women
have
different
hormonal
profiles
from
women
of
normal
weight
This
is
in
part
because
fat
cells
themselves
release
hormones
Some
of
these
affect
appetite
control
and
metabolism
others
affect
blood
pressure
Fat
cells
also
release
estradiol
a
form
of
estrogen
So
when
an
obese
woman
becomes
pregnant
her
fetus
is
exposed
to
various
fat
hormones
Whether
these
hormones
shape
someone?s
personality
is
unclear
But
since
exposure
to
hormones
in
the
womb
affects
personality
in
so
many
other
cases
it
strikes
me
as
possible
that
it
could
here
too
In
the
United
States
the
obesity
epidemic
began
about
30
years
ago
We
are
now
at
a
point
where
one
third
of
all
pregnant
women
are
obese
Their
children
will
be
voting
in
about
20
years
time
If
an
obese
environment
in
the
womb
has
an
impact
on
aspects
of
personality
that
affect
political
views
we
may
soon
be
seeing
a
big
shift
in
the
body
politic
So
there
could
be
a
connection
between
obesity
in
pregnant
women
and
the
vote
of
their
future
baby
Or
not
And
if
there
is
then
we'll
see
a
big
shift
in
the
body
politic
But
in
what
direction
Who
knows
it
hasn't
yet
and
very
well
may
not
Got
all
that
Maybe
possibly
could
may
if
That's
10
minutes
of
my
life
I'll
never
get
back

You
are
sleeping
you
do
not
want
to
believe
IC
and
I
were
out
at
a
friend's
birthday
dinner
last
night
The
restaurant
is
a
Mexican
place
in
a
non-residential
part
of
Midtown
As
the
waitress
led
us
to
our
table
IC
looked
around
and
said
signs
of
a
bad
economy
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
place
was
half-full
or
in
his
mind
half-empty
Now
this
place
is
enormous
It's
two
floors
and
just
a
giant
giant
space
And
it's
sort
of
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
Also
it
was
7:30
Most
New
Yorkers
don't
eat
at
7:30
unless
like
us
they
were
trying
to
make
it
home
in
time
for
the
Hopkins
v
Pavlik
fight
So
the
fact
that
they
were
even
at
half-capacity
was
impressive
By
the
time
we
left
every
single
table
in
this
huge
space
was
occupied
At
no
point
did
IC
say
this
was
a
sign
of
a
robust
economy
A
few
weeks
ago
he
had
off
for
Columbus
Day
As
we
were
in
a
cab
heading
downtown
he
sighed
I
just
saw
an
unemployed
person
How
do
you
know
he's
unemployed
I
just
know
But
we're
in
Columbus
Circle
one
of
the
most
touristy
parts
of
the
city
How
do
you
know
he
wasn't
a
tourist
No
way
that
guy
was
from
New
York
Also
it's
Columbus
Day
You're
off
from
work
and
you're
never
off
from
work
But
it's
mostly
bankers
that
are
off
today
Maybe
that
guy
was
a
banker
Pshah
That
guy
was
no
banker
As
I
hadn't
seen
this
mystery
unemployed
person
who
represented
the
fact
that
the
economy
was
doneski
I
asked
IC
to
point
out
other
unemployed
people
on
our
route
He
sat
up
straight
in
the
cab
and
started
looking
but
then
admitted
that
Times
Square
where
the
cab
now
was
might
not
be
the
best
place
to
identify
hard-up
New
Yorkers
My
stories
are
not
just
to
illustrate
that
I'm
with
the
biggest
pessimist
of
all
time
which
y'know
is
awesome
but
that
we
shouldn't
get
caught
up
in
looking
for
signs
of
a
slowed
economy
where
there
might
not
be
any
No
one
is
saying
things
are
good
right
now
but
so
much
of
it
is
psychological
You
look
around
and
think
you're
seeing
unemployed
people
and
before
you
know
it
you're
thinking
about
not
taking
your
girl
to
Turks
and
Caicos
for
the
weekend
to
look
at
possible
wedding
locations
Which
is
obviously
crazy
talk
Joking
aside
I
am
in
general
an
optimist
and
despite
the
fact
that
every
branch
of
our
government
has
decided
that
socialism
is
the
answer
I
believe
in
America
in
a
very
long
term
way
We'll
get
through
this
difficult
time
and
we
won't
remember
when
we
were
looking
around
for
signs
of
end
of
days
I'm
looking
forward
to
that
even
if
my
man
will
be
back
to
his
regularly
scheduled
pessimistic
projections
like
we're
going
to
be
late
we
weren't
there
won't
be
any
tables
there
were
and
the
Cowboys
are
going
to
lose
without
Romo
fingers
crossed
I
have
no
idea
why
I
chose
this
for
my
headline
but
major
props
to
anyone
who
gets
where
it's
from
without
the
use
of
google
