So
what
was
the
deal
with
Brokaw
during
that
debate
the
other
night
Did
the
guy
have
a
date
or
something
I
don't
think
anyone
cared
if
they
spoke
for
an
extra
20
seconds
so
they
could
finish
their
circular
arguments
and
empty
promises
In
his
defense
though
he
might
have
been
getting
tired
of
the
back
and
forth
as
to
who
in
fact
first
gave
a
crap
about
the
housing
crisis
at
one
point
I
felt
like
I
was
watching
Harry
and
Lloyd
from
Dumb
and
Dumber
argue
about
the
rules
of
tag
in
the
front
seat
You
can't
triple-stamp
a
double-stamp
I
don't
feel
like
harping
about
how
John
called
Barack
That
One
which
to
me
sounds
like
he
is
starting
to
believe
that
his
opponent
is
in
fact
The
One
and
that
he
is
going
to
free
us
all
from
The
Matrix
I
won't
get
stuck
on
how
Maverick
and
Goose
have
been
singing
Obama
and
Ayers
sitting
in
a
tree
along
the
campaign
trail
then
decided
that
without
a
crowd
of
people
prepared
to
shout
Treason
and
Kill
That
Secret
Muslim
it
would
probably
be
a
better
idea
not
to
mention
it
I'm
not
interested
in
talking
about
when
McCain
straight
called
that
one
guy
dumb
for
not
knowing
what
Fannie
and
Freddie
were
before
this
little
economic
hiccup
but
he
did
know
what
they
were
you
racist
I
will
ignore
that
McCain
paced
around
the
floor
like
he
was
lost
I'll
overlook
that
really
uncomfortable
joke
about
how
Brokaw
would
not
be
vetted
as
a
possible
Treasury
Secretary
Forget
about
the
fact
that
anyone
who
played
a
drinking
game
involving
the
phrase
my
friends
is
likely
still
hung
over
No
what
I
feel
compelled
to
talk
about
is
science
Its
not
exactly
a
hot-button
issue
this
year
and
only
gets
mentioned
in
the
context
of
energy
independence
and
global
warming
and
when
campaign
spokesmen
brag
about
how
John
invented
the
Blackberry
I
didn't
exactly
participate
in
science
fairs
while
growing
up
at
least
not
after
the
crushing
sense
of
defeat
I
felt
when
the
judges
mocked
my
baking
soda
and
vinegar
volcano
But
I
like
to
think
of
myself
as
someone
who
is
interested
in
the
subject
and
I
believe
that
science
education
needs
to
be
higher
up
on
the
list
of
educational
priorities
As
far
as
politics
go
I
would
assume
that
as
a
broad
generalization
one
might
argue
that
there
is
a
correlation
between
being
on
the
left
or
the
right
and
having
an
affinity
or
aversion
to
science
If
you
are
a
Massachusetts
liberal
I
would
think
that
you
are
more
likely
to
want
sex
ed
and
evolution
taught
If
you
are
a
Texas
conservative
you
probably
would
like
to
substitute
the
words
penis
and
vagina
with
naughty
appendage
and
post-marriage
female
orifice
in
your
children's
science
textbooks
which
coincidentally
also
have
Adam
and
Eve
on
the
cover
It
came
as
no
surprise
to
me
when
John
brought
up
a
3
million
projector
that
Barack
voted
to
fund
in
Illinois
and
mocked
it
pretty
hard
Granted
J-Mac
likely
has
no
idea
what
a
projector
is
but
Mavericks
can't
let
shit
like
that
be
paid
for
by
us
taxpayers
so
he
asked
My
friends
do
we
need
to
spend
that
kind
of
money
If
he
doesn't
like
the
idea
of
giving
kids
health
coverage
why
should
we
expect
him
to
want
to
educate
kids
If
McCain
is
elected
I
can't
really
imagine
that
Flying
Car
research
and
development
would
speed
up
dramatically
Surely
an
Obama
Administration
would
have
a
more
progressive
stance
on
science
considering
that
he
was
willing
to
pony
up
money
for
this
projector
as
well
as
advocate
sex
ed
for
kindergarten
students
and
by
sex
ed
I
mean
teaching
them
the
difference
between
appropriate
and
inappropriate
touching
by
others
but
we'll
get
back
to
that
later
Given
this
assumption
I
had
that
an
Obama
Administration
would
be
a
friend
to
science
I
was
very
intrigued
by
a
headline
that
asked
Will
Obama
Kill
Science
Surely
the
National
Review
Online
would
have
some
interesting
distortions
facts
Normally
I
would
dismiss
anything
that
John
Derbyshire
would
say
just
as
you
would
dismiss
the
homeless
guy
on
the
corner
who
is
warning
us
that
Gremlins
are
real
and
that
they
are
planning
a
war
on
humans
I
guess
I
have
a
hard
time
taking
someone
seriously
who
has
voluntarily
described
himself
as
a
homophobe
though
a
mild
and
tolerant
one
and
a
racist
though
an
even
more
mild
and
tolerant
one
However
anyone
who
manages
to
hold
down
a
job
in
journalism
for
as
long
as
he
has
must
mean
he's
got
some
readers
out
there
who
believe
what
he
writes
so
I
read
it
After
presenting
the
titles
of
several
biology
books
that
he
looked
up
on
Amazon
so
as
to
demonstrate
that
he
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
Mr
Derbyshire
makes
the
case
that
since
Obama
is
a
Marxist
he
is
going
to
outlaw
certain
sciences
Essentially
his
point
is
that
because
Obama
believes
so
strongly
in
equality
and
acceptance
of
others
he
will
effectively
kill
the
study
of
biology
and
genetics
out
of
fear
that
advances
in
these
fields
will
reveal
that
certain
races
I'm
guessing
Derbyshire
means
white
people
are
superior
to
other
races
let's
assume
he
means
I
don't
know
black
people
Keep
in
mind
that
he
is
a
tolerant
racist
How
does
he
draw
the
conclusion
that
Obama
is
a
Marxist
Why
a
link
to
Ann
Dunham's
Obama's
mother
Wikipedia
entry
of
course
If
you
take
the
time
to
read
her
entry
however
the
word
Marxist
does
not
show
up
once
Even
is
she
was
a
capitalism-hating
Marxist
I
am
not
sure
how
that
would
automatically
mean
that
Obama
is
one
too
If
parents
personalities
automatically
translate
to
their
children
then
Ms
Dunham
was
more
patriotic
than
the
average
American
After
the
Pearl
Harbor
attack
her
father
joined
the
Army
and
her
mother
worked
at
a
Boeing
plant
in
Wichita
Derbyshire
explains
that
the
younger
generation
of
human-sciences
enthusiasts
trend
conservative/libertarian
and
Obama
has
them
worried
First
of
all
before
we
call
foul
on
this
statement
keep
in
mind
that
he
uses
the
word
enthusiasts
rather
than
scientists
I
guess
church
groups
that
talk
about
human
sciences
would
fall
into
that
heading
Secondly
you
might
wonder
where
he
is
gathering
his
evidence
that
these
enthusiasts
are
worried
The
link
reveals
that
it
is
from
anonymous
commenters
on
a
blog
he
reads
I
would
love
to
read
the
bibliographies
on
his
term
papers
McCain
is
still
learning
how
to
use
email
and
to
make
his
VCR
stop
flashing
12:00
and
Obama
is
advocating
extending
sex
ed
and
science
museum
funding
yet
Obama
is
the
anti-science
candidate
The
planetarium
likely
full
of
young
conservative
science
enthusiasts
issued
a
statement
in
defense
of
the
projector
To
clarify
the
Adler
Planetarium
requested
federal
support
which
was
not
funded
to
replace
the
projector
in
its
historic
Sky
Theater
the
first
planetarium
theater
in
the
Western
Hemisphere
To
remain
competitive
and
ensure
national
security
it
is
vital
that
we
educate
and
inspire
the
next
generation
of
explorers
to
pursue
careers
in
science
technology
engineering
and
math
The
same
article
explains
that
the
tightly-knit
scientific
community
is
rallying
against
McCain
now
and
that
he
should
not
be
counting
on
the
science
vote
Before
you
say
that
this
attack
by
Derbyshire
is
just
one
guy's
crazy
ramblings
and
that
surely
no
one
with
a
brain
not
made
of
Play-Doh
would
fall
for
the
argument
he
makes
remember
this
When
George
Bush
ran
for
office
in
2000
you
know
against
Al
Gore
he
was
seen
by
many
voters
as
being
the
greener
candidate
