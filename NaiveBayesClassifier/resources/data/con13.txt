Economy
Since
the
mortgage
meltdown
last
month
I'd
always
thought
a
good
number
of
those
who
then
switched
to
Obama
as
the
candidate
of
the
party
out
of
power
would
take
a
second
look
at
the
Democrat
and
return
to
the
Republican
fold
With
increasing
evidence
of
Obama's
redistributionist
ethic
they
have
greater
reason
to
fear
the
economic
policies
he
would
enact
if
elected
Other
voters
who
had
long
opted
for
Obama
as
a
change
after
eight
years
of
a
Republican
president
or
because
they
were
impressed
by
his
presence
or
due
to
economic
anxieties
might
in
the
end
have
concerns
about
his
readiness
to
lead
At
the
last
minute
they
could
switch
to
McCain
as
a
Democratic
friend
of
mine
switched
to
Bush
just
a
few
days
before
the
2004
general
election
With
Joe
the
Plumber's
help
John
McCain
has
finally
found
his
footing
on
economic
issues
That
has
helped
him
better
articulate
an
economic
message
while
rattling
Obama
supporters
Indeed
it
caused
one
former
Obama
speechwriter
Wendy
Button
to
switched
to
John
McCain
While
Button
had
been
having
doubts
about
the
Democrats
since
the
summer
it
was
the
party's
treatment
of
Joe
the
Plumber
which
finally
turned
her
The
final
straw
came
the
other
week
when
Samuel
Joseph
Wurzelbacher
a.k.a
Joe
the
Plumber
asked
a
question
about
higher
taxes
for
small
businesses
Instead
of
celebrating
his
aspirations
they
were
mocked
He
wasn't
a
real
plumber
and
They're
fighting
for
Joe
the
Hedge-Fund
manager
and
the
patronizing
I've
got
nothing
but
love
for
Joe
the
Plumber
The
party
I
believed
in
wouldn't
look
down
on
working
people
under
any
circumstance
And
Joe
the
Plumber
is
right
This
is
the
absolutely
worst
time
to
raise
taxes
on
anyone
the
rich
the
middle
class
the
poor
small
businesses
and
corporations
Will
Joe
the
Plumber's
message
and
the
treatment
he
suffered
from
the
Democrats
resonate
with
other
Obama
supporters
Will
in
the
campaign's
final
days
will
other
less
prominent
supporters
follow
Button's
lead
and
switch
to
John
McCain
I
would
expect
that
there
will
be
some
but
wonder
if
it
will
be
enough
to
make
a
difference
John
McCain
can
only
help
himself
and
our
nation
by
hitting
the
economic
message
as
he
has
these
past
few
days
talking
about
our
party's
respect
for
the
common
working
man
and
woman
how
we
celebrate
the
spirit
of
entrepreneurship
how
we
resent
excessive
regulation
and
out-of-control
spending
The
Republican
message
still
resonates
with
the
American
people
We
just
need
a
good
messenger
A
reader
alerted
me
to
a
blog
post
quoting
another
Obama
aide
wary
about
her
one-time
candidate
Because
I
can't
confirm
her
identity

While
Dick
Morris
expects
undecideds
to
break
for
McCain
I've
been
trying
to
figure
out
how
they'll
break
on
Proposition
8
I
wonder
if
some
who
indicate
they're
undecided
have
already
made
up
their
mind
but
refuse
to
tell
pollsters
because
they
fear
they
won't
give
the
response
they
expect
the
pollster
wants
to
hear
That
could
mean
Yes
is
a
stronger
position
than
the
polls
indicate
Or
could
those
undecided
voters
do
what
I
and
other
Californians
do
when
they're
uncertain
about
ballot
propositions
vote
No
Or
given
the
number
of
issues
on
this
year's
ballot
in
the
Golden
State
will
they
not
even
get
that
far
and
not
vote
in
that
race
In
the
end
Californians
being
who
we
are
I
think
it'll
boil
down
to
a
libertarian
argument
If
undecideds
see
the
initiative
as
preventing
gay
people
from
exercising
their
freedom
then
they'll
vote
against
it
If
the
see
state
recognition
of
gay
marriage
as
forcing
us
to
accept
gay
marriage
they'll
vote
in
favor
Both
sides
played
in
this
libertarian
notion
The
first
Yes
ad
using
San
Francisco
Mayor
Gavin
Newsom's
words
to
say
we'd
get
gay
marriage
whether
we
liked
it
or
not
The
third
No
ad
showed
respect
for
opponents
of
gay
marriage
with
this
line
Because
regardless
of
how
you
feel
about
marriage
it's
wrong
to
treat
people
differently
under
the
law
The
No
side
would
be
in
a
better
position
had
it
built
on
that
notion
showing
a
respect
for
those
who
believe
marriage
is
between
one
man
and
one
woman
but
at
the
same
time
don't
want
to
prevent
same-sex
couples
from
seeking
state
recognition
of
their
unions
That's
why
I
believe
the
No
side
would
have
been
better
served
had
it
used
freedom
or
liberty
in
its
slogan
instead
of
equality

Gay

compares

I've
seen
some
loopy
things
in
this
campaign
but
this
one
really
takes
the
cake
This
proponent
of
Proposition
8
seems
to
compare
himself
to
a
German
theologian
who
stood
up
to
Hitler
Not
sure
I
follow
his
logic
here
but
then
again
I
don't
much
get
the
left
when
they
compare
Bush
to
Hitler
and
Republicans
to
Nazis
If
Bush
were
Hitler
wouldn't
they
then
be
in
concentration
camps
for
criticizing
him
If
Republicans
were
Nazis
wouldn't
they
be
proposing
laws
preventing
minority
groups
from
participating
in

society
while
preparing
them
for

deportation
and
execution
Similarly
this
guy
doesn't
seem
to
face
censure
for
standing

he's
standing
up
to
If
this

Barney
Frank's
Partisan

110th
Congress
Arrogance
of
the
Liberal
Elites
Republican-hatred
As
I
pondered
Barney
Frank's
accusation
that
John
McCain
was
appealing
to
anti-gay
prejudice
when
he
brought
up
the
Masachusetts
Democrat's
recent
proposals
to
raise
taxes
and
slash
defense
spending
I
was
struck
at
how
quick
he
was
to
smear
Republicans
Instead
of
taking
issue
with
McCain's
arguments
perhaps
defending
the
merits
of
his
proposed
tax
increases
or
showing
how
a
drastic
cut
in
national
defense
wouldn't
impact
national
security
he
immediately
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
a
Republican
would
only
bring
him
up
to
play
into
anti-gay
sentiments
Does
he
believe
his
statements
are
not
worthy
of
criticism
Is
he
incapable
of
recognizing
that
conservatives
might
object
to
his
ideas
Why
does
he
assume
that
a
Republican
who
criticizes
him
does
so
because
of
prejudice
I
mean
he
equates
McCain's
criticism
of
him
with
past
Republican
efforts
to
raise
voter
concerns
about
the
prospect
of
congressmen
Charles
Rangel
and
John
Conyers
who
are
black
becoming
committee
chairs
Um
Barney
both
men
come
from
the
extreme
left
of
your
party
with
the
latter
having
a
mock
impeachment
inquiry
over
the
Iraq
war
before
he
chaired
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
with
a
host
of
left-wing
conspiracy
theorists
It
seems
Barney
harbors
similar
conspiracy
theories
about
Republicans
given
the
assumptions
he
makes
about
us
Call
it
his
partisan
prejudice
It's
a
sad
day
for
America
when
a
politician
so
prominent
and
so
smart
harbors
such
prejudices
about
the
opposing
party
He
ignores
our
ideas
and
assumes
our
animus

Obama's
Pretense

Obama
Watch
Perhaps
the
one
thing
which
caused
me
to
change
my
once
favorable
opinion
of
Barack
Obama
was
when
I
realized
his
notion
of
a
new
kind
of
politics
was
just
a
slogan
pretense
masking
an
undistinguished
record
The
more
familiar
I
became
with
Obama's
ideas
the
more
apparent
it
became
that
he
was
pretty
much
a
standard
issue
liberal
See
a
social
problem
look
for
a
government
solution
He
had
no
record
of
reaching
across
the
partisan
divide
to
forge
a
consensus
on
controversial
issues
had
never
bucked
his
party
leadership
on
such
matters
Heck
he
hadn't
even
stood
up
to
bigots
and
extremists
in
his
own
life
Two
pieces
I
read
in
the
past
twenty-four
hours
confirm
this
image
of
Obama
offering
the
same
kind
of
politics
his
party
has
offered
for
more
than
three-quarters
of
a
century
Jonah
Goldberg
contends
the
Democratic
nominee
symbolizes
a
return
to
an
older
vision
of
the
United
States
that
was
seen
as
the
wave
of
the
future
eight
decades
ago
In
a
more
detailed
piece
Roger
Kimball
finds
most
depressing
is
the
extent
to
which
the
whole
Obama
juggernaut
represents
a
return
of
bad
ideas
that
have
already
been
tried
time
and
again
have
failed
and
made
people
poorer
and
less
stalwart
and
yet
seem
poised
to
make
a
sorry
comeback
once
again
In
listing
the
taxes
Obama
plans
to
raise
Kimball
holds
that
Obama
plans
to
resuscitate
the
welfare
policies
of
the
Great
Society
but
by
stealth
Obama's
promise
is
all
pretense
It's
not
a
new
kind
of
politics
but
the
same
old
liberalism
The
only
difference
is
that
when
FDR
tried
these
ideas
back
in
the
1930s
he
didn't
know
they
would
exacerbate
the
Great
Depression
Now
we
have
a
record
of
their
failure
but
that's
not
deterring
Obama
from
wanting
to
try
them
again

Watch
In
the
course
of
this
campaign
my
opinion
of
Barack
Obama
has
eroded
Once
impressed
with
the
charismatic
Senator
the
more
I
learned
about
him
the
less
confident
I
became
of
his
abilities
to
unite
this
nation
and
lead
our
government
My
confidence
in
the
Democratic
presidential
hopeful
began
to
slip
when
I
read
his
then-celebrated
now
all
but
forgotten
speech
on
race
He
was
then
tryingt
to
contain
the
political
damage
caused
by
the
revelation
of
his
pastor's
hateful
sermons
As
I
put
it
at
the
time
he
dodged
the
real
issue
failing
to
explain
why
he
never
challenged
his
pastor
for
his
crazy
comments
Of
course
those
comments
were
more
than
crazy
They
were
mean-spirited
and
evidenced
a
prejudice
against
white
people
and
the
nation
which
protected
his
right
to
utter
such
bile
Now
I
don't
share
the
mindset
the
Stonewall
Democrats
I
don't
believe
a
parishioner
necessarily
agrees
with
his
preacher
on
every
subject
I
don't
think
Obama
has
the
same
angry
animosity
against
white
people
as
does
the
Reverend
Wright
or
holds
to
the
same
lunatic
conpiracy
theories
But
Barack
Obama
has
styled
himself
a
new
kind
of
politician
one
who
can
unite
the
nation
Wouldn't
such
a
man
a
leader
who
promotes
change
have
the
guts
to
stand
up
to
a
man
with
whom
he
was
close
and
challenge
his
bigotry
and
question
his
narrow
world
view
That
Obama
chose
to
remain
silent
says
a
lot
about
the
man
He
chose
not
to
make
waves
He
voted
present
on
Reverend
Wright's
bigotry
For
twenty
years
when
he
sat
in
that
church
Barack
Obama
had
the
chance
to
make
a
tough
decision
by
challenging
a
man
he
admired
He
had
an
opportunity
to
do
the
right
thing
to
take
a
stand
against
bigotry
He
took
a
pass
on
that
one
Is
that
the
kind
of
guy
we
want
as
president
One
who
dodges
decision-making
A
man
who
sits
silently
by
when
a
friend
a
trusted
advisor
spews
malice
toward
many

Do
Palin-hating

Ronald
Reagan
Sarah
Palin
The
Jewish
Athena
Jennifer
Rubin
just
penned
er
pixeled
a
most
excellent
post
on
Sarah
Palin
looking
at
the
divisions
within
conservative
circles
over
the
Republican
Vice
Presidential
nominee
Rubin
divides
us
into
Players
and
Kibitzers
with
the
players
political
activists
loving
the
Alaska
Governor
while
the
kibitzers
intellectuals
revile
her
It's
an
interesting
breakdown
which
makes
sense
even
if
it
isn't
perfect
I
mean
I
see
myself
as
more
a
kibitzer
than
a
player
and
I'm
pretty
enthusiastic
about
the
Alaska
Governor
The
distinction
makes
a
lot
more
sense
when
Rubin
fleshes
it
out
so
make
sure
to
read
the
whole
thing
What
really
struck
me
about
the
post
was
Rubin's
critique
of
the
kibitzers
those
who
don't
hold
office
or
run
campaigns
or
much
bother
with
real
voters
They
write
books
tell
us
what
is
wrong
with
conservatism
and
scold
the
poor
slobs
who
run
campaigns
They
lack
any
visceral
sense
of
actual
conservative
voters
Their
bent
is
decidedly
academic
and
their
approach
to
politics
is
sterile
That
pretty
much
nails
it
They
don't
understand
the
imperative
to
inspire
voters
When
they
see
Reagan
they
see
primarily
his
intellectual
bent
They
miss
the
importance
of
Hollywood
to
his
success
his
understanding
of
appealing
to
an
audience
And
they
forget
the
years
he
spent
traveling
the
country
working
for
General
Electric
meeting
with
talking
to
listening
to
the
company's
employees
Reagan
knew
he
had
to
reach
out
to
these
people
Having
spent
sixteen
years
in
politics
in
a
state
where
personal
contact
matters
more
than
uplifting
rhetoric
Sarah
Palin
has
learned
the
same
thing
Now
as
I've
said
before
she
just
needs
to
complete
her
conservative
education
And
then
she
might
sway
some
of
her
conservative
skeptics
with
another
Athena
likely
becoming
the
first
to
admit
her
error
in
underestimating
Palin's
promise

Obama
Watch
I
did
not
watch
the
Obama
infomercial
last
night
The
mere
thought
of
it
raised
my
hackles
The
Democrat
paid
for
it
with
broken
promises
and
possibly
even
broken
laws
As
I
worked
on
my
piece
on
his
opportunism
yesterday
I
became
increasingly
aware
how
duplicitous
this
man
has
been
and
how
the
media
has
covered
for
him
They
have
barely
touched
the
story
of
his
broken
promise
and
all
but
failed
to
consider
his
fund-raising
irregularities
When
he
promised
to
accept
public
financing
and
challenged
Republicans
to
do
the
same
Obama
may
have
truly
meant
to
keep
his
word
But
given
how
quickly
he
changed
his
mind
and
how
flimsy
his
rationale
it
appears
that
word's
not
worth
very
much
Can
we
trust
a
man
who
readily
reneges
on
a
promise
he
repeated
on
multiple
occasions
Now
I
don't
know
if
Obama
broke
any
laws
in
raising
his
record-setting
haul
but
the
evidence
we've
accumulated
so
far
clearly
indicates
an
investigation
is
in
order
His
campaign
confirmed
that
it
is
allowing
donors
to
use
largely
untraceable
prepaid
credit
cards
that
could
potentially
be
used
to
evade
limits
on
how
much
an
individual
is
legally
allowed
to
give
or
to
mask
a
contributor's
identity
Ed
Morrissey
believes
the
only
reason
the
campaign
deliberately
turned
off
the
systems
that
would
have
guarded
against
the
kind
of
fraudulent
donations
that
have
accrued
millions
to
their
coffers
was
to
facilitate
fraud
Emphasis
in
original
We
don't
know
if
donors
took
advantage
of
the
lax
online
security
to
donate
more
than
the
legal
limit
We
don't
know
if
foreigners
barred
by
law
from
contributing
to
presidential
campaigns
supported
the
Democrat's
campaign
Heck
the
Obama
campaign
may
not
even
know
but
they
did
do
a

of

which

Arrogance
of

Elites
Mean-spirited
leftists
Let's
see
Barney
Frank
refuses
to
take
any
responsibility
for
the
mortgage
mess
He
accuses
Republicans
of
racism
when
they
fault
government
programs
for
causing
the
crisis
Now
he's
getting
all
bent
out
of
shape
because
John
McCain
on
the
campaign
trail
is
making
an
issue
of
the
Massachusetts
Democrat's
proposals
to
raise
taxes
increase
domestic
spending
and
gut
the
defense
budget
Ol
Barney
says
it's
because
he's
gay
calling
McCain's
attack
on
his
actual
statements
an
appeal
to
prejudice
Sorry
Barney
it's
not
because
you're
gay
it's
because
you're
a
liberal
who's
been
clearer
than
any
of
your
colleagues
on
what
would
happen
should
the
Democrats
win
the
White
House
and
increase
their
congressional
majorities
next
week
I
thought
that
Barney
was
really
smart
Yet
he
doesn't
seem
to
understand
where
Republicans
have
been
coming
from
since
his
first
election
to
Congress
in
1980
All
he
can
do
is
accuse
us
of
the
most
nefarious
of
motives
Doesn't
sound
like
a
very
smart
man
to
me
sounds
like
a
very
narrow
and
intolerant
one
As
Allahpundit
puts
it
Barney
never
met
a
bad-faith
accusation
he
didn't
like
Grow
up
Barney
quit
your
belly-aching
admit
your
mistakes
resign
from
the
chairmanship
of
the
House
Financial
Services
Committee
and
become

role
model
of
responsiblity
for

Gay
Marriage
In
a
comment
to
my
post
on
the
absence
of
a
serious
debate
on
marriage
in
the
campaign
against
Proposition
8
a
reader
asked
to
hear
your
reasons
why
you
support
same
sex
marriage
or
don't
and
your
reasons
why
you
support
Prop
8
or
don't
While
I
have
some
concerns
with
the
campaign
against
the
initiative
and
have
some
sympathy
for
the
arguments
of
some
of
its
proponents
I
plan
on
voting
No
on
8
next
Tuesday
I
want
to
see
the
state
Supreme
Court
decision
mandating
gay
marriage
overturned
At
the
same
time
I
don't
want
the
traditional
definition
of
marriage
enshrined
in
the
state
Constitution
But
the
only
way
to
overturn
that
decision
is
to
amend
the
constitution
We
can't
achieve
one
without
the
other
Hence
my
lukewarm
opposition
The
constitution
will
remain
free
of
the
offending
clause
A
bad
decision
will
stand
Simply
put
I
don't
believe
it's
the
province
of
the
judiciary
to
decide
the
qualifications
for
marriage
in
a
particular
state
That
responsibility
belongs
to
the
legislature
and
here
in
the
Golden
State
given
our
liberal
initiative
policies
to
the
people
In
2000
the
people
voted
overwhelmingly
to
define
marriage
as
the
union
of
one
man
and
one
woman
Proposition
22
Fewer
than
five
years
later
the
California
legislature
voted
to
recognize
gay
marriage
Instead
of
defying
the
people
they
served
our
legislators
should
have
referred
the
matter
back
to
them
asking
citizens
to
repeal
22
Had
the
citizens
done
so
then
the
legislature
could
have
taken
up
the
issue
In
some
ways
I
see
Proposition
8
as
our
chance
to
weigh
in
on
22
I
vote
No
on
8
as
I
would
have
voted
Yes
to
repeal
22
So
if
we
do
defeat
8
then
the
people
will
indeed
have
voted
for
gay
marriage
It
would
not
have
just
been
the
court
mandating

when
I
first
watched
Barack
Obama
for
an
extended
period
of
time
in
this
campaign
I
was
impressed
by
his
presence
but
concerned
by
the
vagueness
of
his
responses
He
preferred
platitudes
to
substantive
replies
As
the
campaign
kicked
into
gear
in
the
following
months
I
kind
of
warmed
to
the
Illinois
Senator
He
seemed
an
uplifting
contrast
to
the
more
wonkish
Hillary
Clinton
His
victory
speech
in
Iowa
was
inspiring
At
the
time
I
believed
he
was
truly
committed
to
bipartisan
reform
that
he
had
the
capacity
to
bring
people
together
He
seemed
a
principled
leader
But
when
he
emerged
as
the
Democratic
frontrunner
after
his
victory
in
the
Wisconsin
primary
his
appeal
began
to
fade
He
continued
to
avoid
substantive
issues
and
became
testy
when
pressed
with
tough
questions
about
his
relationship
to
Tony
Rezko
And
then
came
Reverend
Wright
His
initial
speech
impressed
many
on
the
left
but
concerned
me
He
didn't
address
a
fundamental
question
how
come
this
man
who
claimed
to
be
a
uniter
never
up
to
his

hateful
rhetoric
He
claimed
he
could
no

bigotted
man
than
he
could
disown
the

Six
weeks
later
he
did
just
that
A
new
Obama
emerged
the
opportunist
This
would
not
be
the
last
time
he
flip-flopped
for
political
advantage
As
soon
as
he
secured
enough

to
win

nomination
he
pivoted
so
much
on

that

Gay
Marriage

Because
my
post
on
Yishai
Kabaker's
Nutshell
Case
for
Gay
Marriage
attracted
such
a
spirited
debate
I
asked
him
if
I
could
post
the
entire
essay
he
had
submitted
to
the
Stanford
Review
as
that
conservative
paper
had
to
cut
it
to
meet
their
guidelines
With
his
permission
in
the
interest
of
furthering
the
kind
of
discussion
of
gay
marriagemissing
from
the
debate
on
California's
Proposition
8
I
am
posting
his
untruncated
piece
below
Perhaps
the
greatest
tragedy
of
the
gay
marriage
debate
is
the
deaf
shouting
past
both
sides
without
realizing
the
common
goals
they
share
Tensions
have
been
ratcheted
up
as
gay
rights
groups
and
family
values
groups
compete
to
out
fund
one
another
before
the
November
election
and
the
referendum
on
gay
marriage
The
proposed
Constitutional
amendment
Proposition
8
seeks
to
reinforce
marriage
as
an
institution
between
a
man
and
a
woman
thereby
reversing
a
May
decision
by
the
California
Supreme
Court
that
extended
marriage
to
gay
couples
As
a
gay
conservative
I
find
myself
caught
between
the
two
camps
I
am
strongly
in
favor
of
gay
marriage
yet
I
understand
the
concern
of
conservatives
at
the
perceived
attack
on
marriage
The
gay
rights
movement
was
born
in
the
late
60's
early
70's
as
a
segment
of
the
greater
Civil
Rights
Movement
The
early
gay
movement
forged
a
unique
culture
emblemized
by
gay
pride
parades
drag
queens
and
the
Sexual
Revolution
Since
the
mainstream
institutions
were
vehemently
opposed
to
homosexuality
gays
and
lesbians
felt
little
desire
to
conform
or
emulate
those
institutions
As
mainstream
society
grew
more
tolerant
of
homosexuals
it
diminished
the
need
for
the
extreme
in-your-face
advocates
While
major
issues
of
homophobia
and
hatred
still
face
the
community
mainstream
American
society
is
moving
in
the
general
direction
of
greater
acceptance
of
homosexuality

Watch
In

President
Harry

reversed
his

fortunes
and
avoided
what
then-seemed
a
long
certain
defeat
by
running
not
just
against
his
Republican
opponent
Tom
Dewey
but
also
against
the
first
Republican
Congress
elected
since
the
New
Deal
Tagging
the
80th
Congress
a
do-nothing
legislature
as
he
did
throughout
the
campaign
Truman
told
voters
in
Charleston
West
Virginia
on
October
1
of
that
year
The
Republicans
would
like
you
to
forget
these
fundamental
differences
between
the
two
parties
But
during
the
past
2
years
we
have
been
given
a
sharp
warning
that
these
differences
still
exist
and
these
differences
are
wide
and
deep
I
know
of
course
that
there
are
many
fine
people
throughout
the
United
States
who
from
habit
or
choice
are
members
of
the
Republican
Party
To
them
I
say
that
the
national
leadership
of
their
party
has
failed
them
miserably
With
the
current
Democratic
Congress's
approval
as
historic
lows
making
George
W
Bush
seem
downright
popular
by
comparison
it
would
seem
John
McCain
would
do
well
to
run
a
similar
campaign
against
the
do-nothing
110th
as
a
reminder
of
a
stark
difference
between
the
parties
It
seems
the
only
thing
the
Democratic
Congress
has
been
able
to
do
has
to
be
to
increase
federal
spending
at
levels
even
greater
than
those
of
the
preceding
spendthrift
Republican
Congresses
Having
scored
his
congressional
colleagues
in
the
past
for
spending
money
like
a
drunken
sailor
John
McCain
should
have
found
a
profligate
Democratic
Congress
a
natural
target
But
maybe
the
presidential
election
has

the
incompetence
of
this
Congress
from
exciting
as
much
interest
as
it
should
No
sooner
did
Democrats
take
over
in
2007
than
the
2008
race
for
the
White
House
began
And
that
seems
to
have
turned
media
attention
away
from
the

to
the
hustings
The
unending
presidential
campaign
may
well
have
prevented
a
campaign
against
Congress
from
really
resonating

John
McCain's
Avuncular
Chemistry
With
Sarah
Palin

Sarah
Palin
I
have
to
say
I'm
saddened
and
kind
of
surprised
to
read
about
the
sniping
at
Sarah
Palin
within
the
McCain
campaign
Whichever
aides
are
badmouthing
their
boss's
running
mate
are
betraying
him
as
much
as
they're
betraying
her
He
picked
her
He
stands
by
her
It's
clear
he
really
likes
her
respects
her
is
energized
by
her
When
I
see
John
McCain
together
with
Sarah
Palin
I'm
reminded
of
how
I
feel
when
I'm
around
one
of
my
older
nieces
those
smart
girls
whose
age
and
intelligence
allows
you
to
communicate
about
more
than
dolls
and
stuffed
animals
and
whose
bright
future
you
can
visualize
Of
course
Sarah
Palin
has
at
least
three
decades
on
my
eldest
niece
including
sixteen
years
of
public
service
But
you
can
see
the
same
dynamic
between
him
and
her
as
you
would
see
observing
a
proud
uncle
grooming
his
precocious
niece
to
help
run
the
family
business
Not
only
does
the
elder
man
see
his
relative's
potential
but
he
has
great
affection
for
her
as
well
She's
more
than
just
an
up-and-coming
co-worker
Having
learned
of
her
record
in
Alaska
where
she
according
to
Michael
Barone's
Almanac
of
American
Politics
won
election
to
the
governorship
as
a
maverick
reformer
at
arm's
length
from
her
party
John
McCain
surely
saw
a
younger
version
of
himself
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
even
if
it
meant
defying
party
leadership
There's
a
real
chemistry
between
John
McCain
and
Sarah
Palin
Media
stories
of
the
sniping
within
campaign
cannot
obscure
what
we
observe
when
we
watch
them
together
on
TV
Or
when
we
see
them
in
person
And
isn't
that
as
much
of
a
story
as
gossip
about
a
campaign's
internecine
squabbles
Emphasis
added
UPDATE
How's
this
for
serendipity
one
of
my
nieces
is
dressing
up
as
Sarah
Palin
for
Hallowe'en
That's
sure
to
scare
some
angry
Democrats

Just
returning
from
a
dinner
with
college
alumni
entertainment
group
and
had
a
political
discussion
like
those
I
enjoyed
as
an
undergraduate
Each
person
had
the
chance
to
articulate
his
point
of
view
We
listened
and
responded
to
opposing
perspectives
As
the
only
Republican
there
the
only
one
defending
Sarah
Palin
and
John
McCain
well
I
loved
it
There
are
times
when
it
can
be
fun
to
the
odd
man
out
provided
your
interlocutors
respect
whatever
it
is
that
sets
you
apart
from
them
I
experienced
that
tonight
It
reminded
me
why
I
so
love
my
alma
mater
where
my
favorite
Political
Science
professor
was
a
Marxist
who
taught
the
best
course
I've
ever
taken
and
not
just
at
Williams
Conservative
Political
Thought
I
was
delighted
to
learn
that
an
alumnae
while
not
a
fan
of
Sarah
Palin
was
impressed
with
the
Alaska
Governor
aware
of
her
accomplishments
only
disagreeing
with
her
on
the
issues
and
believing
her
not
yet
ready
for
national
office
Others
surprised
at
my
enthusiasm
for
my
party's
vice
presidential
nominee
did
listen
when
I
listed
her
accomplishments
of
which
most
were
not
familiar
We
all
expressed
ourselves
honestly
without
rancor
or
ad
hominem
attacks
We
ended
the
evening
aware
of
our
political
differences
but
not
holding
them
against
one
another
Our
country
would
be
a
better
place
if
all
political
exchanges
could
be
so
civil

President
Wary
of

Obama
Watch
Politics
abroad
One
of
the
things
Obama
supporters
repeat
ad
nauseum
about
their
candidate
is
that
his
election
would
restore
our
image
abroad
Today
ABC
News
reporter
raises
that
very
question
Could
an
Obama
Win
Restore
America's
Global
Image
Her
subhead
answers
the
question
in
the
affirmative
But
over
at
the
Atlantic
a
sensible
blogger
wonders
if
European
leaders
are
worried
about
Obama
A
month
ago
Victor
Davis
Hanson
found
that
beneath
the
popular
enthusiasm
for
Obama
lay
serious
concerns
about
the
Democrat's
policies
Another
reporter
ABC's
indispensable
and
adorable
Jake
Tapper
links
a
report
in
Israeli
newspaper
Haaretz
indicating
that
French
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
views
the
Democratic
candidate's
stance
on
Iran
as
utterly
immature
and
comprised
of
formulations
empty
of
all
content
Following
their
July
meeting
Sarkozy
repeatedly
expressed
disappointment
with
Obama's
positions
on
Iran
concluding
that
they
were
not
crystallized
and
therefore
many
issues
remain
open
the
Israeli
source
said
Advisors
to
the
French
president
who
held
separate
meetings
with
Obama's
advisors
came
away
with
similar
impressions
and
expressed
similar
disappointment
Sarkozy's
concerns
are
consistent
with
those
raised
this
summer
by
European
officials
that
Obama's
campaign
pledge
to
begin
direct
talks
with
Iran
on
its
nuclear
program
without
preconditions
could
potentially
rupture
U.S
relations
with
key
European
allies
early
in
a
potential
Obama
administration
Obama's
election
might
restore
our
image
abroad
but
at
the
cost
of
our
relations
with
our
allies
Our
influence
would
thus
be
reduced
Commenting
on
Sarkozy's
comments
Ed
Morrissey
calls
Obama
an
empty
suit
who
could
wind
up
being
more
unilateral
than
George
Bush
in
his
foreign
policy
Another
sign
that
Obama's
change
from
the
last
eight
years
means
a
change
for
the
worse

Obama
Watch
In
his
recent
essay
on
media
bias
in
the
2008
presidential
race
Michael
Malone
writes
I'm
not
one
of
those
people
who
think
the
media
has
been
too
hard
on
say
Republican
vice
presidential
nominee
Gov
Sarah
Palin
by
rushing
reportorial
SWAT
teams
to
her
home
state
of
Alaska
to
rifle
through
her
garbage
This
is
the
big
leagues
and
if
she
wants
to
suit
up
and
take
the
field
then
Gov
Palin
better
be
ready
to
play
what
I
object
to
and
I
think
most
other
Americans
do
as
well
is
the
lack
of
equivalent
hardball
coverage
of
the
other
side
or
worse
actively
serving
as
attack
dogs
for
the
presidential
ticket
of
Sens
Barack
Obama
D-Ill
and
Joe
Biden
D-Del
If
the
current
polls
are
correct
we
are
about
to
elect
as
president
of
the
United
States
a
man
who
is
essentially
a
cipher
who
has
left
almost
no
paper
trail
seems
to
have
few
friends
that
at
least
will
talk
and
has
entire
years
missing
out
of
his
biography
That
isn't
Sen
Obama's
fault
His
job
is
to
put
his
best
face
forward
No
it
is
the
traditional
media's
fault
for
it
alone
unlike
the
alternative
media
has
had
the
resources
to
cover
this
story
properly
and
has
systematically
refused
to
do
so
But
gradually
in
dribs
and
drabs
at
the
end
of
the
campaign
the
MSM
well
at
least
the
daily
newspapers
from
our
nation's
two
largest
cities
are
reporting
something
conservative
writers
have
been
abuzz
about
for
weeks
if
not
months
how
little
we
know
about
Barack
Obama
and
his
policies
In
today's
LA
Times
Peter
Nicholas
a

who
has
covered
the

writes

out
to

in

can't

is
or
if
he
is

The
barriers
set
in

between
us
and
him
were
just
too
great

the

the
humdrum
human
