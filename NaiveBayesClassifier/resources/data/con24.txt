ABC
Learns
a
Lesson
Now
this
is
what
I
call
progress
after
two
years
of
almost
nonstop
excoriation
of
Bush
and
the
Iraq
conflict
ABC
decides
to
run
a
two
hour
special
on...wait
for
it...UFOs
Flying
saucers
and
strange
beings
who
have
visited
Earth
aren't
the
typical
topics
reported
by
Peter
Jennings
anchor
of
ABC's
World
News
Tonight
Jennings
whose
new
two-hour
special
tackles
the
subject
of
UFOs
admits
he
and
his
production
team
began
the
project
with
doubts
and
a
dose
of
curiosity
We
have
a
lot
of
skeptics
I
am
very
skeptical
but
we
seriously
investigated
something
a
lot
of
people
are
serious
about
he
said
And
when
we
come
to
the
end
this
is
wonderfully
interesting
Executive
producer
Tom
Yellin
said
the
UFO
field
is
a
risky
thing
to
report
since
it
doesn't
go
with
the
conventional
wisdom
that
this
stuff
is
kind
of
silly
and
the
whole
subject
has
been
tainted
by
the
brush
of
wackiness
Like
Jennings
Yellin
initially
had
reservations
about
devoting
a
program
to
UFOs
I
thought
it
was
all
a
bunch
of
baloney
Even
though
it
has
public
appeal
you
don't
want
to
do
something
that
subjects
you
to
ridicule
just
to
get
a
rating."Unless
of
course
you
are
Dan
Rather
and
Andrew
Hayward
But
then
in
their
case
CBS
wasn't
after
ratings
they
were
after
Bush's
presidency
Perhaps
ABC
has
learned
a
lesson
from
Rather
and
CBS
better
to
stick
to
safe
stories
like
UFO
sightings
than
fake
stories
like
the
National
Guard

Now
they've
done
it
Now
we
discover
that
the
terrorists
have
made
a
HUGE
mistake
BAGHDAD
Iraqi
state
television
aired
a
video
yesterday
showing
what
the
U.S.-funded
channel
said
was
the
confession
of
a
captured
Syrian
officer
who
said
he
trained
Iraqi
terrorists
to
behead
people
and
build
car
bombs
to
attack
American
and
Iraqi
troops
He
also
said
the
terrorists
practiced
beheading
animals
to
train
for
decapitating
hostages.Oh
it's
on
now
Someone
call
PETA
I
mean
I
can
understand
the
need
to
practice
your
jihad
skills
in
order
to
butcher
Western
infidels
but
those
poor
animals
were
innocent
This
is
immoral
This
inhumane
treatment
must
cease
This
kind
of
brutality
cannot
be
tolerated
The
terrorists
will
rue
the
day
that
they
crossed
the
Left
like
this
crickets
chirping
Or
perhaps
not
But
the
terrorists
better
watch
their
step...the
first
time
they
test
skincare
products
on
those
animals
it's
on

Site
Traffic
and
the
Real
Section
31
As
some
of
you
may
know
I
have
been
less
than
prolific
in
posting
recently
due
to
real
life
issues
Imagine
my
surprise
then
when
over
the
past
week
my
daily
site
traffic
has
doubled
I
have
been
getting
a
whole
slew
of
Google
refers
from
searches
for
Section
31
enough
to
where
this
blog
is
now
the
number
2
Google
site
referred
by
those
search
terms
I
suspect
that
this
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
recent
cancellation
of
UPN's
Enterprise
the
most
recent
series
in
the
Star
Trek
franchise
Unfortunately
I
haven't
followed
the
series
as
closely
as
I
would
have
liked
due
to
the
lack
of
a
local
UPN
station
but
apparently
the
series
in
its
waning
episodes
is
going
to
establish
the
very
beginnings
of
Section
31
in
the
Star
Trek
timeline
A
detailed
history
of
Section
31
can
be
found
here
The
concept
of
Section
31
has
intrigued
me
ever
since
it
was
introduced
There
is
a
fascinating
dichotomy
at
work
here
an
organization
that
exists
to
protect
a
set
of
noble
ideals
does
so
by
means
that
at
times
violate
those
same
ideals
For
some
in
the
Star
Trek
universe
the
idea
is
unacceptable
For
them
the
existence
of
Section
31
is
repugnant
to
the
most
basic
principles
of
Federation
culture
But
the
members
of
Section
31
see
things
a
little
differently
They
are
committed
to
the
same
noble
principles
as
the
rest
of
the
Federation
However
they
realize
that
against
some
dangers
more
extreme
measures
must
be
taken
than
their
principles
would
normally
allow
In
effect
Section
31
sacrifices
the
thing
it
is
sworn
to
protect
in
order
to
safeguard
it
for
others
Will
the
United
States
ever
find
itself
in
a
similar
situation
Are
there
dangers
in
this
world
great
enough
to
require
the
bending
or
even
the
breaking
of
our
ideals
in
the
short
term
to
ensure
that
those
ideals
survive
in
the
long
term
I
have
asked
variations
of
this
question
previously
regarding
the
issue
of
torturing
terrorists
The
North
Korean
declaration
of
its
nuclear
capabilities
the
Iranian
rush
to
nuclear
status
and
the
recent
assassination
plot
against
President
Bush
have
all
caused
me
to
ponder
once
again
the
dangers
facing
our
country
and
the
lengths
to
which
our
people
are
prepared
to
go
in
order
to
defend
against
them
It
may
be
that
the
dangers
we
face
will
in
fact
require
action
that
many
will
condemn
perhaps
action
that
even
I
will
condemn
If
that
day
comes
I
may
not
be
able
to
disagree
with
those
who
cry
out
against
the
violation
of
sacred
national
principles
But
even
if
I
join
in
the
outcry
against
extreme
measures
I
suspect
that
deep
inside
there
will
be
a
part
of
me
that
is
thankful
that
someone
else
has
sacrificed
to
keep
me
safe
while
I
condemn
them
for
their
methods
Could
it
be
that
our
culture
needs
both
groups
of
people
one
to
protect
against
external
threats
the
other
to
protect
against
the
first
group
itself

Terrorists
in
America
They
are
here
and
they
want
to
kill
us
I
can't
wait
to
see
the
details
from
this
case
ALEXANDRIA
Va
AP
A
former
Virginia
high
school
valedictorian
who
had
been
detained
in
Saudi
Arabia
as
a
suspected
terrorist
was
charged
Tuesday
with
conspiring
to
assassinate
President
Bush
and
with
supporting
the
al-Qaida
terrorist
network
Ahmed
Omar
Abu
Ali
23
a
U.S
citizen
made
an
initial
appearance
Tuesday
in
U.S
District
Court
but
did
not
enter
a
plea
He
claimed
that
he
was
tortured
while
detained
in
Saudi
Arabia
since
June
of
2003
and
offered
through
his
lawyer
to
show
the
judge
his
scars
The
federal
indictment
said
that
in
2002
and
2003
Abu
Ali
and
an
unidentified
co-conspirator
discussed
plans
for
Abu
Ali
to
assassinate
Bush
They
discussed
two
scenarios
the
indictment
said
one
in
which
Abu
Ali
would
get
close
enough
to
the
president
to
shoot
him
on
the
street
and
alternatively
an
operation
in
which
Abu
Ali
would
detonate
a
car
bomb
According
to
the
indictment
Abu
Ali
obtained
a
religious
blessing
from
another
unidentified
co-conspirator
to
assassinate
the
president
More
than
100
supporters
of
Abu
Ali
crowded
the
courtroom
and
laughed
when
the
charge
was
read
aloud
alleging
that
he
conspired
to
assassinate
Bush.The
indictment
means
that
federal
grand
jury
thinks
that
there
is
probable
cause
that
the
defendant
committed
the
crimes
he
is
charged
with
The
fact
that
he
is
actually
being
charged
and
not
just
held
for
questioning
suggests
to
me
that
investigators
have
rounded
up
as
many
unidentified
co-conspirators
as
they
will
be
able
to
Hopefully
some
useful
intelligence
was
gleaned
from
the
defendants
before
their
arrest
Look
for
defense
counsel
to
try
to
create
a
media
circus
over
the
torture
issue
which
should
be
absolutely
irrelevant
with
respect
to
a
plot
concocted
in
Virginia
to
assassinate
the
President
I
wonder
if
Bush
will
continue
to
mouth
the
stale
old
Religion
of
Peace
platitudes
Probably
It
really
has
reached
the
morbidly
humorous
stage
at
this
point
Muslims
plot
murder
and
mayhem
in
the
name
of
Allah
but
we
are
told
time
and
again
to
overlook
the
behavior
of
a
radical
minority
Sorry
but
I
refuse
to
overlook
the
consistent
religious
sanction
of
indiscriminate
and
in
this
case
discriminate
murder
Sell
crazy
someplace
else
we're
all
stocked
up
here

Washington's
Birthday
Powerline
has
this
great
post
on
the
occasion
of
Washington's
Birthday
now
known
as
President's
Day
It
bears
remembering
how
critical
Washington's
unifying
presence
was
during
the
formation
of
our
country
The
correspondence
between
Washington
and
the
Hebrew
Congregation
of
Newport
Rhode
Island
is
a
wonderful
example
of
the
near
universal
esteem
and
admiration
that
Washington
had
from
his
countrymen
It's
unfortunate
that
most
children
today
will
never
learn
of
Washington's
true
character
but
will
instead
read
only
that
he
was
just
another
oppressive
white
male
slaveowner

Positive
Developments
I
had
a
very
good
interview
yesterday
with
a
local
firm
It
is
currently
a
three-person
firm
with
two
partners
and
one
associate
The
firm
is
a
general
civil
litigation
firm
working
for
primarily
private
and
individual
clients
That
would
be
a
nice
change
from
working
for
insurance
companies
They
also
seemed
much
more
accepting
of
my
salary
requirements
than
I
thought
a
smaller
firm
would
be
The
senior
partner
will
get
back
with
me
so
hopefully
something
good
will
come
of
the
interview
There
are
also
some
other
options
that
may
be
popping
up
involving
independent
contracting
and
consulting
All
in
all
I
feel
much
better
about
life
today
than
I
did
a
week
ago
Isn't
that
usually
how
it
goes
though
