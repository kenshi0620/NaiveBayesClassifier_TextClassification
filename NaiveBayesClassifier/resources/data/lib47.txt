the

of
the

for
the

is
the
annual

we

Nomination
Week
In
Denver
This
week
the
Democratic
National
Convention
will
nominate
Senator
Barack
Obama
for
President
and
Senator
Joe
Biden
for
Vice-President
Besides
the
usual
broadcast
and
cable
coverage
the
Democratic
Party
says
it
will
offer
live
gavel-to-gavel
streaming
video
coverage
in
HD
at
DemConvention.com
This
requires
the
free
Microsoft
Silverlight
platform
which
that
page
has
a
link
to
download
The
DNC
also
says
it
has
credentialed
120
blogs
to
cover
the
events
Unfortunately
they
would
not
give
me
a
list
of
these
However
we
do
know
of
several
local
Democrats
who
will
be
posting
from
the
Convention
First
our
own
DCDP
County
Chair
Darlene
Ewing
from
Senate
District
2
will
be
putting
up
her
own
daily
observations
as
a
delegate
at
the
DCDP
website
Erin
Moore
from
SD
16
is
posting
daily
from
her
own
site
Jeff
Strater
also
from
SD
16
is
putting
up
his
notes
at
his
Denver
Bound
Blog
Paul
Tran
from
SD
23
gives
his
take
at
his
A
Delegate's
Adventure
to
Denver
And
Obama
Dallas
is
hosting
four
more
bloggers
from
the
Convention
None
of
these
are
among
those
credentialed
bloggers
but
between
them
all
they
may
give
you
a
good
grass-roots
view
of
the
events
instead
of
the
silliness
and
spin
of
the
soap-selling
pro
media
If
you
are
a
local
blogger
posting
or
know
of
others
who
are
please
email
me
to
roundup
AT
dallasdemocrats
DOT

and
I'll
post

to
them

Various
individual
candidates
and
the
Coordinated
Campaign
have
been
working
through
the
summer
but
after
Labor
Day
and
two
weeks
of
national
Conventions
more
people
will
be
ready
to
pay
attention
so
all
those
efforts
will
be
magnified
We'll
have
a
Grand
Opening
of
our
Coordinated
Campaign
headquarters
on
September
6th
but
we
won't
be
waiting
until
then
to
hit
the
phone
lines
and
the
streets
Call
your
favorite
candidate's
campaign
to
help
them
or
call
the
party
office
214-821-8331
and
volunteer
to

Obama
Yard
Signs
And
Bumper
Stickers
While
they
last
the
Dallas
County
Democratic
Party
office
now
has
yard
signs
and
stickers
for
Obama
The
stickers
are
free
but
we'd
appreciate
a
5
contribution
for
the
signs
And
no
these
are
just
for
Obama
but
as
soon
as
these
are
given
out
we'll
reorder
for
Obama-Biden
ones
We
also
have
signs
and
stickers
for
several
of
our
local
candidates
this
year
If
you
can't
get
by
the
office
come
to
the
DCDP's
Watch

on
Thursday
Or

it
since

The

arguing
about
whether

the

there

one

it's
not
any

Representative
seat
for
district
112
has
been
featured
on
WFAA-TV
as
one
of
its
candidate
profiles
for
this
election
If

you
can
watch
it
at

which
also
has
a
transcript
of
the
short
piece
Note
how
her
Republican
opponent
demonstrates
again
her
own
party's
cluelessness
denouncing
Sandra
as
a
liberal
Apparently
that
is
defined
by
them
as
anyone
who
supports
public

The

has
also
released
a

of

about

The

Who

The
Darkness
Still
with
1,800
miles
of
line
to
build
the
job
seemed
to
families
very
eager
for
electricity
to
be
taking
a
very
long
time
After
the
lines
had
been
extended
to
their
farms
and
the
farms
were
wired
they
waited
with
wires
hanging
from
the
ceiling
and
bare
bulbs
at
the
end
for
the
lines
to
be
energized
But
then
one
evening
in
November
1939
the
Smiths
were
returning
from
Johnson
City
and
as
they
neared
their
farmhouse
something
was
different
Oh
my
God
her
mother
cried
The
house
is
on
fire
But
as
they
got
closer
they
saw
the
light
wasn't
fire
No
Mama
Evelyn
said
The

are

They
were

WORDS
TO
REMEMBER
They
pretended
perhaps
they
even
believed
that
they
had
seized
power
unwillingly
and
for
a
limited
time
and
that
just
round
the
corner
there
lay
a
paradise
where
human
beings
would
be
free
and
equal
We
are
not
like
that
We
know
that
no
one
ever
seizes
power
with
the
intention
of
relinquishing
it
Power
is
not
a
means
it
is
an
end
One
does
not
establish
a
dictatorship
in
order
to
safeguard
a
revolution
one
makes
the
revolution
in
order
to
establish
the
dictatorship
The
object
of
persecution
is
persecution
The
object
of
torture
is
torture
The
object
of
power
is
power
Now
do
you
begin
to
understand
me
