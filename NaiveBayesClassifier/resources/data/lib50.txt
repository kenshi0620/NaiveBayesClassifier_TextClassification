On
Whether
Saddam
And
Iraq
Had
9/11
Role
I
Believe
They
Did
Last
night
convicted
felon
Sen
Ted
Stevens
R-AK
faced
Anchorage
mayor
and
Senate
candidate
Mark
Begich
in
their
last
debate
before
Tuesday's
election
During
the
debate
Stevens
twice
insisted
that
he
had
not
been
convicted
of
anything
though
of
course
he
was
found
guilty
of
all
seven
counts
of
making
false
statements
on
his
Senate
disclosure
forms
Waving
away
his
conviction
wasn't
Stevens
only
bizarre
moment
in
the
debate
Discussing
Iraq
Stevens
insisted
that
Saddam
Hussein
had
played
a
role
in
the
9/11
attacks
MODERATOR
Knowing
what
you
know
now
do
you
think
that
the
country
of
Iraq
and
Saddam
Hussein
played
a
role
in
the
9/11
attack
on
the
United
States
STEVENS
I
know
more
than
you
think
I
know
and
I
believe
they
did
BEGICH
I
don't
believe
they
did
Perhaps
Stevens
is
taking
a
cue
from
Cheney
in
doubling
down
on
insisting
a
link
existed
between
Iraq
and
9/11
He
wants
Alaskans
to
believe
he
knows
something
they
don't
but
it's
Stevens
whose
facts
are
wrong
The
Sept
11
commission
found
no
collaborative
relationship
between
Iraq
and
al
Qaeda
and
said
there
was
no
cooperation
between
the
two
6/17/04
A
Senate
Intelligence
Committee
report
found
that
Saddam
Hussein
issued
a
general
order
that
Iraq
should
not
deal
with
al
Qaeda
and
found
that
the
Iraqi
regime
never
attempted
to
facilitate
a
relationship
with
bin
Ladin
9/10/06
A
Pentagon
report
looking
into
ties
between
Saddam
Hussein's
Iraq
and
al
Qaeda
showed
no
connection
between
the
two
after
reviewing
600,000
Iraqi
documents
3/13/08
What's
more
the
White
House
knew
that
its
repeated
claims
of
collaboration
between
Iraq
and
al
Qaeda
were
unfounded
A
recent
book
by
Pulitzer
Prize-winning
journalist
Ron
Suskind
claimed
that
after
the
Iraq
war
began
the
White
House
ordered
the
CIA
to
forge
a
backdated
handwritten
letter
from
the
head
of
Iraqi
intelligence
to
Saddam
Hussein
in
an
attempt
to
tie
Hussein
to
the
9/11
attacks

Palin
claims

Palin
claims
that
all
her
appointees
as
governor
absolutely
deserved
the
job
Yesterday
during
an
interview
with
a
local
Louisville
KY
ABC
affiliate
reporter
Mark
Herbert
asked
Sarah
Palin
about
reports
that
she
doled
out
political
positions
to
friends
family
and
campaign
donors
When
Palin
said
the
people
she
hired
weren't
cronies
or
politicos
Herbert
asked
They
weren't
politicos
they
were
just
folks
who
deserved
the
job
Absolutely
yes
Palin
replied
Yet
a
recent
Los
Angeles
Times
examination
of
state
records
has
shown
otherwise
More
than
100
appointments
to
state
posts
nearly
1
in
4
went
to
campaign
contributors
or
their
relatives
sometimes
without
apparent
regard
to
qualifications
Alaska
historians
say
some
of
Palin's
appointees
were
less
qualified
than
those
of
her
Republican
and
Democratic
predecessors
Tom
Lamal
a
public
school
teacher
in
Fairbanks
until
he
retired
in
2006
was
hired
as
a
right-of-way
agent
despite
reports
of
internal
conflicts
over
whether
he
was
qualified
under
state
law
The
New
York
Times
also
reported
last
month
that
Palin
appointed
a
high
school
classmate
to
a
top
position
in
the
State
Division
of
Agriculture
who
cited
her
childhood
love
of
cows
as
a
qualification
for
running
the
roughly
2

Decision

After
Fox
Editor
Defends
LAT
Decision
To
Withhold
Obama
Video
Fox
Continues
Attacking
The
Paper
For
days
now
Fox
News
conservative
bloggers
and
the
McCain
campaign
have
been
accusing
the
Los
Angeles
Times
of
intentionally
suppressing
a
2003
videotape
of
then-state
Sen
Barack
Obama
attending
a
banquet
honoring
Palestinian
activist
Rashid
Khalidi
On
Tuesday
the
Times
said
in
a
statement
that
it
would
not
release
the
tape
because
it
was
provided
to
us
by
a
confidential
source
who
did
so
on
the
condition
that
we
not
release
it
In
a
blog
post
at
4:38
PM
yesterday
Bill
Sammon
the
deputy
managing
editor
of
Fox's
Washington
Bureau
said
that
the
newspaper
is
on
firm
journalistic
ground
in
refusing
to
make
the
tape
public
To
me
it's
pretty
simple
Reporter
Peter
Wallsten
made
an
agreement
with
a
source
to
refrain
from
publicly
disclosing
the
tape
Unless
that
source
lets
Wallsten
off
the
hook
the
reporter
is
journalistically
bound
to
abide
by
the
agreement
regardless
of
how
much
heat
his
newspaper
takes
from
pundits
on
TV
Indeed
Wallsten
has
little
choice
in
the
matter
If
he
were
to
cave
in
to
mounting
public
demands
for
the
tape
no
self-respecting
source
would
ever
give
him
another
shred
of
information
Nor
should
they
But
the
declaration
by
a
top
Fox
News
editor
that
the
decision
by
the
LA
Times
is
non-controversial
hasn't
stopped
the
network's
anchors
and
guests
from
giving
the
paper
heat
On
nearly
every
Fox
show
that
aired
after
Sammon
posted
his
opinion
Fox's
pundits
have
attacked
the
LA
Times
as
being
the
subsidiary
of
a
campaign
and
an
example
of
journalism
losing
objectivity
in
this
election
Watch
a
compilation
of
Fox's
obsession
Some
Fox
pundits
like
Sean
Hannity
and
Bernard
Goldberg
have
accused
the
Times
of
lying
about
their
agreement
with
the
source
I'm
not
sure
the
LA
Times
is
telling
the
truth
said
Goldberg
But
Sammon
addressed
this
point
as
well
saying
Unless
we
have
evidence
to
the
contrary
I'm
afraid
we
have
to
take
The
Times
at
its
word

vows
to

in

term
10
days
after
campaign
says
it's
nearly
impossible
Campaigning
today
Gov
Sarah
Palin
R-AK
said
that
Sen
John
McCain
R-AZ
would
fix
the
economy
by
imposing
a
spending
freeze
She
also
declared
that
a
McCain
administration
would
balance
the
budget
by
the
end
of
their
first
term
Watch
it
Palin
must
not
have
gotten
the
memo
After
promising
a
balanced
budget
though
on
a
constantly
shifting
timeline
for
months
10
days
ago
the
campaign
admitted
that
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
achieve
that
in
just
four
years
The
events
of
the
past
few
months
have
completely
thrown
a
wrench
into
that
there's
no
way
round
it
He
would
still
like
to
balance
it
It's
going
to
be
harder
take
longer

won't
say
if
she
will
vote
for
Ted
Stevens
Earlier
this
week
on
MSNBC
McCain
campaign
flack
Tucker
Bounds
said
that
if
John
McCain
and
Sarah
Palin
were
Alaska
voters
they
would
not
vote
for
Sen
Ted
Stevens
R-AK
who
was
recently
convicted
on
seven
felony
counts
But
as
First
Read
noted
Palin
is
an
Alaska
voter
However
yesterday
during
an
interview
with
a
local
Toledo
OH
CBS
affiliate
Palin
declined
to
answer
when
asked
if
she
would
vote
for
Stevens
Q
So
will
you
cast
your
ballot
for
Ted
Stevens
and
are
you
encouraging
others
to
do
so
PALIN
I've
never
told
people
who
I
have
voted
for
before
because
I
see
that
as
a
very
precious
freedom
in
our
country
Free
and
fair
and
uh
elections
allow
us
to
cast
a
secret
ballot
behind
the
voting
booth
curtain
so
that's
the
way
I'm
going
to
keep
it
Watch
it
When
First
Read
e-mailed
Bounds
to
inform
him
that
Palin
will
indeed
be
voting
in
Alaska
Bounds
replied
She
called
for
him
to
step
down
in
an
interview
this
morning
I
think
I'm
safe

Obama
has
a

anti-Semitic
anti-Israel
and

rhetoric
This

CNN's

the

blogger
Michael
Goldfarb
about
its
hypocritical
criticism
of
Sen

to

After

noted
that

as

of
the
board
at

had
also
given
Khalidi
nearly
500,000

Look

The

is
that

Can

Who's

Goldfarb

Adviser
Pulls
Out
Of
Tech
Debate
Due
To
A
Scheduling
Conflict
Only
To
Appear
On
MSNBC
Instead
Today
from
12:30-1:45
p.m
the
New
America
Foundation
and
Wired
magazine
were
scheduled
to
host
an
event
on
tech
policy
with
top
McCain
adviser
Douglas
Holtz-Eakin
v
Obama
adviser
and
former
FCC
chairman
Reed
Hundt
Holtz-Eakin
however
never
showed
up
From
a
notice
on
the
New
America
Foundation's
website
NOTE
Due
to
a
last-minute
scheduling
conflict
Douglas
Holtz-Eakin
is
unable
to
participate
in
today's
event
and
the
McCain
campaign
will
not
be
sending
an
alternate
spokesperson
The
event
will
proceed
as
scheduled
with
Reed
Hundt
representing
the
Obama
campaign
ThinkProgress
spoke
with
Troy
Schneider
new
media
editor
at
the
New
America
Foundation
who
said
that
the
McCain
campaign
contacted
them
and
canceled
at
9
a.m
today
I
do
think
that
this
was
just
an
honest
scheduling
conflict
said
Schneider
He
got
pulled
into
meetings
he
had
to
do
with
the
campaign
today
An
aide
in
the
McCain
campaign
press
office
said
that
he
believed
Holtz-Eakin
simply
had
campaign
stuff
to
do
but
our
call
to
Holtz-Eakin's
office
has
not
yet
been
returned
However
Holtz-Eakin
appeared
on
MSNBC
today
raising
questions
about
whether
there
really
was
a
true
scheduling
conflict
Holtz-Eakin's
appearance
was
at
1:00
p.m
right
during
the
middle
of
the
New
America
event
While
on
MSNBC
Holtz-Eakin
tried
to
argue
that
Obama
would
be
a
third
term
of
President
Bush
saying
that
it's
Barack
Obama
who's
doubling
down
on
the
Bush
spending
Watch
it
Why
is
the
McCain
campaign
so
afraid
to
debate
tech
policy
Last
week
Thompson
reported
that
WIRED
originally
requested
that
former
Hewlett
Packard
CEO
Carly
Fiorina
represent
the
McCain
campaign
at
the
event
Although
she
said
she
would
be
happy
to
participate
the
McCain
campaign
vetoed
her
Thompson
then
requested
Michael
Powell
Meg
Whitman
or
John
Chambers
Instead
the
campaign
offered
Holtz-Eakin
On
Oct
24
New
America
sent
out
an
invitation
to
the
event
with
the
billing
of
Hundt
and
Holtz-Eakin
This
morning
when
he
learned
that
Holtz-Eakin
was
going
to
be
a
no-show
Thompson
asked
for
Lee
Dunn
Bill
Bailey
and
Bryan
Tramont
None
of
them
were
available
ThinkProgress
also
spoke
with
Nicholas
Thompson
Wired
senior
editor
and
moderator
of
the
event
who
said
that
he
thought
it
was
lame
that
Holtz-Eakin
backed
out
When
we
told
him
that
Holtz-Eakin
had
instead
appeared
on
MSNBC
Thompson
was
shocked
at
the
McCain
campaign's
poor
etiquette
What
was
frustrating
is
that
how
difficult
it
was
to
set
it
up
and
they
knew
how
difficult
it
was
to
set
it
up
and
they
withdrew
at
the
last
minute
McCain
has
been
noticeably
weak
on
tech
policy
during
this
presidential
campaign
McCain
finally
released
his
tech
policy
in
August
a
year
after
Obama
Both
Stanford
University
professor
Lawrence
Lessig
and
vice
president
at
the
Leadership
Conference
on
Civil
Rights
Mark
Lloyd
have
said
that
McCain
would
likely
follow
in
Bush's
undistinguished
steps
on
tech
policy
Today
during
the
event
which
proceeded
without
a
McCain
campaign
representative
Hundt
sharply
criticized
the
McCain
campaign
for
being
too
afraid
to
debate
tech
policy
This
is
feeling
ridiculous
isn't
it
Meaning
we
were
supposed
to
have
a
debate
with
the
other
guy
I'm
gonna
answer
your
question
but
I
just
want
to
say
for
the
record
I'm
pretty
sure
that
McCain
will
show
up
next
Tuesday
I'm
reasonably
confident
of
that
And
I'm
sure
that
Doug
had
something
better
to
do
than
come
here
and
answer
my
questions
about
the
Blackberry
which
you'll
recall
that
it
was
Doug
who
said
that
John
had
invented
it
Watch
the
full
event
here
UpdatePC
Magazine
has
a
write-up
of
Hundt's
remarks
at
today's
event
UpdateOn
the
Wired
blog
Epicenter
Thompson
writes
There
is
apparently
not
a
single
prominent
person
who
supports
John
McCain's
technology
policies
and
is
confident
enough
to
go
out
there
and
debate
in
favor
of
them
He
continues
In
short
the
McCain
camp
chickened

Giuliani
Clueless
On
McCain's
Health
Care
Plan
He's
Not

Give
Anybody

Giuliani
Clueless
On
McCain's
Health
Care
Plan
He's
Not
Going
To
Give
Anybody
5,000
Yesterday
in
an
interview
with
Sean
Hannity
former
New
York
mayor
Rudy
Giuliani
alleged
that
Sen
Barack
Obama's
D-IL
plan
to
reduce
taxes
for
the
middle
class
was
a
ploy
to
create
a
welfare
system
in
the
U.S
Sen
John
McCain's
R-AZ
health
care
plan
also
redistributes
tax
dollars
however
through
a
5000
tax
credit
for
families
to
purchase
health
care
in
the
individual
market
Noting
Giuliani's
hypocrisy
Alan
Colmes
asked
How
is
that
different
than
John
McCain
giving
5,000
to
everybody
for
health
care
Isn't
that
a
handout
Giuliani
claimed
a
tax
credit
isn't
a
handout
GIULIANI
He's
not
going
to
give
he's
not
going
to
give
anybody
5,000
that
is
totally
misrepresenting
his
program
as
you
say
we
do
The
reality
is
he's
going
to
give
you
a
tax
credit
for
5,000
We
get
tax
credits
for
all
kinds
of
things
That's
not
a
handout
COLMES
Isn't
that
a
handout
GIULIANI
It's
a
deduction
it's
a
deduction
from
the
income
that
you
earned
It's
a
tax
credit
like
you
get
a
tax
credit
for
tuition
like
you
get
a
tax
credit
for
other
things
Colmes
astutely
observed
That
is
redistribution
of
wealth
Watch
it
McCain's
health
care
plan
does
indeed
involve
a
5,000
handout
McCain's
tax
credits
and
Guaranteed
Access
Plan
GAP
allow
the
government
to
redistribute
wealth
to
those
who
choose
to
purchase
health
coverage
or
those
who
cannot
afford
or
find
plans
in
the
individual
market
Like
McCain's
broader
economic
proposals
his
health
care
tax
credit
is
unsuitable
for
the
poorest
sickest
individuals
Instead
it
provides
a
one-sized
fits
all
tax
credit
meaning
everyone
would
get
the
same
amount
regardless
of
their
previous
health
or
wealth
Warren
Buffet
would
thus
get
the
same
tax
credit
as
his
secretary
Earlier
this
month
McCain
himself
praised
government
health
care
Referring
to
his
GAP
proposal
McCain
said
that
if
someone
is
not
able
to
qualify
for
any
health
insurance
policy
we
will
establish
government
approved
plans
to
give
them
the
health
insurance
they
need

Contradicts
Himself
On
Spreading
The

Should

McCain
Contradicts
Himself
On
Spreading
The
Wealth
Taxes
Should
Help
Those
Who
Can't
Help
Themselves
On
CNN
last
night
Larry
King
asked
Sen
John
McCain
R-AZ
if
he
really
believed
that
Sen
Barack
Obama
D-IL
is
a
socialist
as
conservatives
have
tried
to
paint
him
No
replied
McCain
before
charging
that
Obama
has
stated
time
after
time
that
he
believes
in
quote
spreading
the
wealth
around
King
pressed
on
asking
Isn't
the
graduated
income
tax
spreading
the
wealth
McCain
admitted
that
it
was
but
claimed
that
it
was
dramatically
different
from
what
he
accuses
Obama
of
supporting
L
KING
Concerning
spreading
the
wealth
isn't
the
graduated
income
tax
spreading
the
wealth
MCCAIN
The
graduated
income
tax
L
KING
If
you
and
I
paid
more
so
that
Jimmy
can
get
some
for
him
or
pay
for
a
welfare
recipient
that's
spreading
the
wealth
MCCAIN
Well
that's
spreading
the
wealth
in
the
respect
that
we
do
have
a
graduated
income
tax
That's
a
far
cry
from
taking
from
one
group
of
Americans
and
giving
to
another
I
mean
that's
dramatically
different
When
King
asked
if
taxes
pay
for
services
McCain
contradicted
his
claim
that
the
graduated
income
tax
wasn't
about
taking
from
one
group
of
Americans
and
giving
to
another
Taxes
pay
to
keep
our
government
secure
to
help
those
who
can't
help
themselves
and
other
functions
of
government
said
McCain
Watch
it
McCain's
contradictory
attempt
to
explain
his
attacks
against
Obama
echoes
the
difficulty
that
his
spokesman
Tucker
Bounds
had
yesterday
in
explaining
Alaska
Gov
Sarah
Palin's
boast
that
Alaskans
share
in
the
wealth
of
windfall
oil
taxes
Bounds
claimed
that
Alaska's
sharing
of
natural
resources
is
unique
and
not
at
all
socialist

Bond
warns
that
Obama
would
nominate
judges
who
empathize
with

By

Bond
warns
that
Obama
would
nominate
judges
who
empathize
with
the
gay
During
his
introductory
remarks
at
a
rally
for
Gov
Sarah
Palin
R-AK
this
morning
Sen
Kit
Bond
R-MO
warned
that
Sen
Barack
Obama
D-IL
would
nominate
judges
who
empathize
with
the
gay
Misrepresenting
Obama's
stated
views
on
judicial
nominations
Bond
proclaimed
Just
this
past
week
we
saw
what
Barack
Obama
said
about
judges
He
said
I'm
tired
of
these
judges
who
want
to
follow
what
the
Founding
Fathers
said
and
the
Constitution
I
want
judges
who
have
a
heart
have
an
empathy
for
the
teenage
mom
the
minority
the
gay
the
disabled
He
thinks
this
country
should
be
a
government
not
a
government
of
laws
but
a
government
of
compassion
and
empathy
not
of
laws
In
fact
in
discussing
judicial
nominations
Obama's
references
to
empathy
only
suggest
that
he
would
seek
individuals
who
were
not
tainted
by
the
culture
wars
of
the
1990s
We
need
somebody
who's
got
the
heart
the
empathy
to
recognize
what
it's
like
to
be
a
young
teenage
mom
The
empathy
to
understand
what
it's
like
to
be
poor
or
African-American
or
gay
or
disabled
or
old
I
am
absolutely
convinced
that
Culture
Wars
are
just
so
90s
Their
days
are
growing

Still
The
Same
Ol
Karl
Rove
I
Wish
McCain's

Attacks
Had

Still
The
Same
Ol
Karl
Rove
I
Wish
McCain's
Khalidi
Attacks
Had
Started
Last
Spring
In
recent
days
Sen
John
McCain's
R-AZ
campaign
has
aggressively
tried
to
paint
Sen
Barack
Obama
D-IL
as
anti-Israel
because
of
his
relationship
with
Palestinian-American
Professor
Rashid
Kahlidi
On
Tuesday
Rudy
Giuliani
pointed
out
that
the
Woods
Foundation
funded
Khalidi's
organizations
while
Obama
was
a
board
member
During
a
rally
in
Ohio
yesterday
Gov
Sarah
Palin
R-AK
characterized
Khalidi
as
a
radical
professor
and
Obama's
political
ally
In
the
past
few
months
Karl
Rove
has
received
considerable
media
attention
for
saying
that
the
McCain
campaign
had
gone
one
step
too
far
and
sort
of
attributing
to
Obama
things
that
are
you
know
beyond
the
100
percent
truth
test
But
make
no
mistake
Rove
hasn't
really
changed
Yesterday
on
The
O'Reilly
Factor
Rove
had
no
problem
with
the
substance
of
the
misleading
Khalidi
attacks
wishing
only
that
they
had
come
sooner
ROVE
I
worry
a
little
bit
that
they
get
numb
to
it
this
late
in
the
game
We
do
know
is
that
at
the
close
of
the
contest
the
undecided
voters
tend
to
disregard
things
that
they
are
hearing
for
the
first
time
unless
it's
from
a
credible
third
party
source
What
bothers
me
about
this
is
where
was
the
McCain
opposition
research
when
this
article
came
out
last
April
that
talked
about
Obama's
presence
at
the
dinner
for
Khalidi
and
mentioned
in
the
story
the
tape
This
would
be
a
lot
better
if
this
drumbeat
had
been
started
last
spring
rather
than
started
five
or
six
days
before
the
election
Watch
it
The
Khalidi
attacks
are
just
as
misleading
as
all
the
others
that
Rove
condemned
earlier
As
the
Washington
Post
explained
in
2004
Khalidi
is
a
well-respected
mainstream
scholar
of
Middle
Eastern
studies
and
doesn't
have
a
radical
take
on
the
present
state
of
affairs
Additionally
while
McCain
served
as
chairman
of
its
board
the
International
Republican
Institute
distributed
several
grants
to
the
Palestinian
research
center
co-founded
by
Khalidi
Evidently
you
can
take
Rove
out
of
dirty
politics
but
you
can't
take
dirty
politics
out
of
Rove

has
been
helping
the
Iranians
stand
in
the
way
of
the
agreement
Roston
calls
Chalabi
a
key
figure
in
Iranian
efforts
to
scuttle
the
status-of-forces
agreement
that
is
under
fierce
negotiation
between
Baghdad
and
Washington
He
is
seen
more
and
more
by
the
U.S
as
a
foreign
agent
an
Iranian
agent
Roston
told
me
by
telephone
from
Mexico
where
he
is
vacationing
What
Chalabi
says
is
equated
with
the
Iranian
position
on
the
status-of-forces
agreement
Roston
said
which
it
opposes
Chalabi
told
Iran's
state
media
last
month
that
the
U.S
wants
secret
military
bases
in
Iraq
and
Stein
notes
that
yesterday
a
Shiite
newspaper
in
Baghdad
featured
his
opposition
to
the
security
agreement
In
fact
last
May
U.S
officials
cut
off
all
contact
with
Chalabi
because
of
unauthorized
contacts
with
the
Iranian
government
But
Chalabi's
renewed
meddling
puts
a
spotlight
on
the
fact
that
he
has
palled
around
with
some
of
John
McCain's
most
senior
campaign
advisers
Randy
Scheunamann
top
foreign
policy
adviser
As
president
of
the
Committee
for
the
Liberation
of
Iraq
before
the
Iraq
invasion
Schuenamann
promoted
Chalabi
as
the
new
Iraqi
Ataturk
and
his
Iraqi
National
Congress
INC
group
as
a
government
in
exile
Charlie
Black
top
political
adviser
Black
and
his
lobbying
firm
BKSH
and
Associates
represented
Chalabi
and
the
INC
giving
Chalabi
access
to
high-powered
officials
in
Washington
Just
last
week
McCain
told
a
local
New
Hampshire
reporter
that
we
just
achieved
a
security
agreement
with
the
Iraqis
while
at
the
same
time
Chalabi
whom
McCain
once
called
a
patriot
with
Iraq's
best
interests
at
heart
was
undermining
the
deal
Indeed
as
Roston
observed
Chalabi
is
a
genius
at
staying
relevant
