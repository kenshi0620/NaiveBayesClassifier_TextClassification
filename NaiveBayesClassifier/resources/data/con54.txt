The
Obama
campaign
has
bumped
representatives
from
three
major
newspapers
that
endorsed
John
McCain
for
president
over
Obama
off
of
its
campaign
plane
for
the
final
days
of
the
race
The
Dallas
Morning
News
Washington
Times
and
New
York
Post
have
all
been
told
to
move
out
by
Sunday
to
make
room
for
network
bigwigs
and
possibly
for
the
inclusion
of
reporters
from
two
black
magazines
ESSENCE
and
JET
according
to
Drudge
The
Times
confirmed
the
move
in
a
report
filed
today
which
said
in
part
The
Obama
campaign
informed
the
newspaper
Thursday
evening
of
its
decision
which
came
two
days
after
The
Times
editorial
page
endorsed
Senator
John
McCain
over
Mr
Obama
The
Times
editorial
page
runs
completely
independent
of
the
news
department
This
feels
like
the
journalistic
equivalent
of
redistributing
the
wealth
we
spent
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
covering
Senator
Obama's
campaign
traveling
on
his
plane
and
taking
our
turn
in
the
reporter's
pool
only
to
have
our
seat
given
away
to
someone
else
in
the
last
days
of
the
campaign
said
Washington
Times
Executive
Editor
John
Solomon
I
hope
the
candidate
that
promises
to
unite
America
isn't
using
a
litmus
test
to
determine
who
gets
to
cover
his
campaign

It
has
been
interesting
to
observe
the
public
debate
over
Barack
Obama's
associations
with
individuals
whose
personal
histories
can
only
be
categorized
as
radical
Bill
Ayers
is
a
former
terrorist
Jeremiah
Wright
preaches
race
adversarialism
For
the
most
part
Obama's
friendships
with
these
men
has
been
water
off
a
duck's
back
for
the
electorate
Imagine
a
different
scenario
There
is
an
evangelical
candidate
He
is
the
best
evangelical
candidate
ever
A
Rhodes
Scholar
a
distinguished
lawyer
who
has
argued
before
the
Supreme
Court
astoundingly
eloquent
you
get
the
idea
This
candidate
is
a
conservative
but
answers
all
questions
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
making
anyone
uncomfortable
He
hits
all
the
right
chords
Further
imagine
that
the
record
shows
this
man
was
once
heavily
involved
with
Christian
reconstructionists
who
believe
stoning
should
be
re-instituted
for
adultery
He
went
to
a
church
for
two
decades
where
a
Christian
reconstructionist
preached
each
Sunday
One
of
his
mentors
was
part
of
a
group
that
bombed
abortion
clinics
Where
would
that
candidate
be
right
now
And
how
different
would
that
candidate
be
in
terms
of
associations
from

So
this
is
reported
from
the
Times
UK
Barack
Obama's
senior
advisers
have
drawn
up
plans
to
lower
expectations
for
his
presidency
if
he
wins
next
week's
election
amid
concerns
that
many
of
his
euphoric
supporters
are
harbouring
unrealistic
hopes
of
what
he
can
achieve
The
sudden
financial
crisis
and
the
prospect
of
a
deep
and
painful
recession
have
increased
the
urgency
inside
the
Obama
team
to
bring
people
down
to
earth
after
a
campaign
in
which
his
soaring
rhetoric
and
promises
of
hope
and
change
are
now
confronted
with
the
reality
of
a
stricken
economy
Barack
Obama
lays
plans
to
deaden

after
election
victory
Well

The
Des
Moines
Register
offers
an
example
of
a
dementia
patient
voting
by
absentee
ballot
Reports
that
an
87-year-old
Council
Bluffs
woman
was
allegedly
pressured
to
vote
absentee
by
a
Democratic
campaign
volunteer
raise
suspicions
that
some
people
who
have
diminished
mental
capacity
are
being
targeted
a
Republican
official
said
Wednesday
The
allegation
by
Chris
Taylor
a
spokesman
for
the
Republican
National
Committee
refers
to
claims
by
Angela
Murphy-Hayes
who
said
her
87-year-old
mother
a
dementia
patient
was
coerced
to
cast
a
ballot
about
two
weeks
ago

Since
the
indictment
and
conviction
of
Ted
Stevens
Time
ran
a
series
on
indicted
Senators
One
that
they
discussed
was
John
Smith
from
OH
1803-1809
They
describe
him
as
a
Republican
from
Ohio
That's
funny
First
of
all
his
party
affiliation
as
described
by
the
Congressional
Bioguide
as
Democratic
Republican
Any
person
who
knows
anything
about
American
political
history
knows
that
this
was
the
predecessor
to
the
modern
Democratic
Party
Second
of
all
there
wasn't
actually
a
Republican
Party
at
the
time
It
was
founded
depending
on
your
story
in
either
Ripon
Wisconsin
or
Jackson
MI
in
1854
The
point
isn't
a
partisan
one
The
point
is
that
the
reporters
editors
and
fact-checkers
seem
to
be
sloppy
about
their
facts
and
historical
illiterates
Not
a
good
sign

I
had
no
idea
that
the
KGB
were
back
in
business
A
state
agency
has
revealed
that
its
checks
of
computer
systems
for
potential
information
on
Joe
the
Plumber
were
more
extensive
than
it
first
acknowledged
Helen
Jones-Kelley
director
of
the
Ohio
Department
of
Job
and
Family
Services
disclosed
today
that
computer
inquiries
on
Samuel
Joseph
Wurzelbacher
were
not
restricted
to
a
child-support
system
The
agency
also
checked
Wurzelbacher
in
its
computer
systems
to
determine
whether
he
was
receiving
welfare
assistance
or
owed
unemployment
compensation
taxes
she
wrote
Jones-Kelley
made
the
revelations
in
a
letter
to
Ohio
Senate
President
Bill
M
Harris
R-Ashland
who
demanded
answers
on
why
state
officials
checked
out
Wurzelbacher
Harris
called
the
multiple
records
checks
questionable
and
said
he
awaits
more
answers
It's
kind
of
like
Big
Brother
is
looking
in
your
pocket
he
said
As
the
story
indicates
Jones-Kelly
donated
2,500
to
the
Obama
campaign
The
story
uncovered
four
uses
of
state
computer
systems
to
access
personal
information
on
Wurzelbacher
As
Auric
Goldfinger
put
it
once
is
happenstance
Twice
is
coincidence
The
third
time
is
enemy
action
What
precisely
do
we
call
it
when
something
nefarious
happens
for
the
fourth
time

we

out

Far

But
it

Embattled

defendant
in
a
pair
of
slander
lawsuits
stemming
from
his
repeated
shouting
from
rooftops
that
U.S

cold-blooded
killers
John

sent
a
message
to
MoveOn.org's
email
list
asking
members
to
remember
his
chip
in
to
his
surprisingly
difficult
reelection
bid
Further
a
Murtha
fundraiser
sent
an
urgent
request
this
afternoon
to
defense
industry
lobbyists
which
read
Cong
Murtha
is
in
a
brutal
re-election
campaign
The
Swift
Boaters
have
put
up
a
candidate
from
Virginia
and
have
raised
millions
of
dollars
against
Cong
Murtha
In
addition
other
527s
and
the
NRCC
have
spent
millions
to
smear
Cong
Murtha
on
TV
radio
and
in
newspapers
We
need
to
raise
another
1
million
to
compete
If
you
have
contributed
thank
you
We
are
asking
all
to
MAX
their
campaign
contributions
5,000
PACs
and
2,300
individual
We
need
money
immediately
We
need
to
raise
another
1
million
to
compete
We
need
to
raise
another
1
million

Now
those
are
words
I'll
wager
the
17-term
Democrat
representative
never
expected
to
have
said
about
one
of
his
campaigns
especially
five
days
out
from
an
election
and
its
tone
sounds
pretty
distantly
removed
from
Murtha's
bravado-filled
declaration
of
two
days
ago
that
there
is
no
gddmned
way
a
Virginia
carpetbagger
will

This
is
pathetic
beyond
words
When
will
Democratic
leaders
realize
that
every
time
Joe
Lieberman
spouts
right-wing
talking
points
on
TV
as
a
Democrat
or
attends
a
Republican
press
conference
as
a
Democrat
that
spites
their
face
big-time
So
here's
the
plan
Immediately
after
Election
Day
if
Democrats
don't
need
Lieberman
as
their
60th
vote
in
the
Senate
progressive
activists
in
Nevada
will
stand
in
front
of
Harry
Reid's
office
for
hours
and
read
your
letters
to
Harry
Reid
about
Joe
Lieberman
Media
will
be
invited
It
will
be
a
grand
spectacle
and
Harry
Reid
will
get
the
hint
that
in
the
progressive
era
he
needs
to
be
bold
And
the
first
step
is
to
boot
Joe
Lieberman
Write
your
letter
to
Reid
