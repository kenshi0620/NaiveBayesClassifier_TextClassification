So
now
that
Bush
has
nominated
a
female
to
the
Supreme
Court
who
the
hell
is
she
Personally
even
if
Bush
is
a
hateful
conservative
he
would
have
gotten
so
much
political
gain
in
landmarking
the
first
female
Chief
Justice
in
the
history
of
the
United

Miers
Nomination
Raises
Important
Questions
for
Women
Statement
of
NOW
President
Kim
Gandy
October
3
2005
George
W
Bush's
nomination
of
White
House
Counsel
Harriet
Miers
to
serve
as
Associate
Justice
of
the
Supreme
Court
raises
important
questions
for
women's
rights
supporters
While
we
are
pleased
that
Bush
chose
a
woman
for
the
High
Court
her
judicial
philosophy
is
more
important
than
her
gender
Miers
potential
as
a
justice
is
unknown
at
this
point
What
we
do
know
about
Miers
is
that
she
is
a
Bush
loyalist
having
worked
closely
with
him
since
at
least
1993
With
this
nomination
Bush
has
raised
to
new
heights
his
fondness
for
promoting
close
confidantes
like
Dick
Cheney
and
Alberto
Gonzales
to
top
positions
If
confirmed
Miers
would
fill
the
seat
of
retiring
Justice
Sandra
Day
O'Connor
who
was
the
key
swing
vote
to
preserve
the
basic
protections
of
Roe
v
Wade
to
require
a
health
exception
to
state-level
abortion
restrictions
to
allow
affirmative
action
in
college
admissions
and
to
protect
Title
IX's
promise
of
equal
educational
opportunities
for
women
and
girls
among
many
others
After
careful
consideration
of
O'Connor's
record
and
judicial
philosophy
NOW
testified
in
support
of
her
confirmation
in
1981
While
she
was
a
conservative
O'Connor
did
support
basic
human
rights
and
liberties
that
transcend
the
often
rigid
labels
of
liberal
or
conservative
It
remains
to
be
seen
where
Miers
stands
on
those
and
virtually
every
other
issue
She
has
no
paper
trail
and
has
never
served
as
a
judge
quite
simply
her
future
conduct
on
the
Court
may
be
impossible
to
determine
Should
the
Senate
confirm
someone
to
a
lifetime
appointment
with
so
little
information
We
think
not
NOW
urges
the
Senate
to
ask
tough
questions
insist
on
answers
and
refuse
to
confirm
this
nomination
unless
they
can
establish
that
Miers
supports
the
fundamental
rights
of
women
The
rights
of
women
and
girls
are
on
the
line
too
much
is
at
stake
to
confirm
a
stealth
nominee
to
the
Court

Great
Put
An
Anti-Women's
Rights
Chief
Justice
on
the
Bench
So
AGAIN
disgracing
women
Bush
decides
to
leave
women
behind
and
of
all
people
choose
Roberts
for
Chief
Justice
He
didn't
even
wait
for
Rehnquist's
funeral
The
biggest
gain
he
could
have
had
was
to
be
bold
enough
to
nominate
the
first
female
chief
justice
the
U.S
has
had
great
political
capital
to
be
gained
from
that
but
no
he
is
such
a
sexist
pig
Anyway
here's
a
message
from
the
respectable
NOW-National
Organization
for
Women
Nomination
of
John
Roberts
as
Chief
Justice
is
an
Outrage
to
Women
Statement
of
NOW
President
Kim
Gandy
September
5
2005
The
National
Organization
for
Women
has
been
outspoken
in
our
opposition
to
the
nomination
of
an
anti-women's
rights
anti-civil
rights
judge
John
G
Roberts
to
sit
on
the
U.S
Supreme
Court
Now
that
Roberts
attitudes
toward
women
have
been
revealed
it
is
an
outrage
and
an
insult
to
the
women
of
this
country
that
George
W
Bush
has
nominated
such
a
jurist
to
be
Chief
Justice
of
the
United
States
First
there
cannot
be
a
stealth
nominee
for
Chief
Justice
Bush
must
release
every
document
from
Roberts
tenure
as
Principal
Deputy
Solicitor
General
under
the
first
President
Bush
and
any
remaining
writings
from
his
time
as
an
advisor
to
the
Reagan
administration
How
dare
Bush
nominate
this
candidate
for
the
top
position
on
the
Supreme
Court
when
his
administration
has
deliberately
concealed
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pages
of
his
writings
during
a
time
that
he
was
one
of
the
top
lawyers
representing
the
people
of
the
United
States
If
the
Bush
administration
refuses
to
release
these
papers
we
must
ask
ourselves
what
they
are
hiding
And
the
Senate
must
ask
the
same
question
The
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
and
the
full
Senate
must
find
its
collective
spine
and
not
roll
over
for
Bush's
favored
candidate
They
must
refuse
to
move
forward
until
all
requested
documents
are
released
and
they
must
ask
even
tougher
questions
of
Roberts
because
of
the
critical
nature
of
the
Chief
Justice
appointment
Second
NOW
is
even
more
concerned
that
John
Roberts
as
Chief
Justice
will
have
a
greater
opportunity
to
move
the
Court
and
our
country
backward
The
Chief
Justice
plays
a
key
role
in
leading
the
Court
including
deciding
who
writes
certain
opinions
making
numerous
appointments
within
the
judicial
system
and
presiding
alone
over
presidential
impeachment
hearings
If
Roberts
is
confirmed
as
Chief
Justice
Bush
will
have
established
right-wing
leadership
of
the
Court
for
another
30
years-a
lifetime
legacy
of
the
Bush
presidency
that
women
and
girls
will
have
a
lifetime
to
regret
Third
I
am
taken
aback
but
not
surprised
by
Bush's
cynicism
and
lack
of
compassion
in
nominating
Chief
Justice
William
Rehnquist's
successor
even
as
his
body
is
being
prepared
to
lie
in
repose
at
the
Court
Bush's
lack
of
sensitivity
has
been
on
prominent
display
this
past
month
as
he
avoided
Gold
Star
mom
Cindy
Sheehan
and
was
stubbornly
slow
responding
to
the
humanitarian
crisis
in
New
Orleans
and
Mississippi
With
the
South
still
in
turmoil
from
Hurricane
Katrina
Bush
is
pressuring
the
Senate
to
rush
through
this
very
important
process
and
confirm
John
Roberts
to
a
lifetime
as
Chief
Justice
while
the
country
is
looking
the
other
way
Finally
Bush
now
has
a
second
opportunity
to
honor
Sandra
Day
O'Connor's
legacy
by
naming
a
moderate
woman
to
replace
her
as
associate
justice
He
can
get
it
right
this
time
and
if
Bush
needs
any
help
finding
a
woman
who
will
uphold
women's
rights
NOW
will
be
happy
to
help

Bush
Doesn't
Like
Blacks
Time
for
a
strong
analysis
on
what
the
hell
is
going
on
Our
military
that
prides
itself
in
getting
to
foreign
countries
in
a
matter
of
a
day
or
even
a
couple
of
hours
when
they
are
given
a
direct
order
to
do
so
took
5
FIVE
days
to
get
to
a
city
that
was
hundreds
of
miles
away
What
is
wrong
When
TV
reporter
asked
What
took
you
so
long
the
reply
was
well
it
was
hard
to
get
here
dammit
we
the
media
and
the
red
cross
were
here
http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/articles/1811092.html
Take
a
look
at
what
happened
for
9/11
Bush
sent
everyone
out
there
to
look
for
survivors
The
very
next
day
you
had
the
necessary
equipment
now
they
took
5
days
A
person
can
only
live
without
food
for
15
days
and
no
water
for
3
days
You
can't
tell
me
that
the
elderly
stuck
in
New
Orleans
will
actually
last
5
days
without
water
Why
is
this
happening
Because
the
people
left
behind
are
the
elderly
and
the
minority
Turn
on
the
TV
what
do
you
see
African
Americans
and
the
elderly
Not
to
mention
the
fact
that
when
the
buses
made
it
to
New
Orleans
the
National
Guard
stopped
these
people
from
getting
on
so
that
the
people
staying
at
the
Marriott
would
get
on
It
really
makes
me
mad
to
think
that
outright
they
are
discriminating
The
rich
white
people
got
out
in
time
Now
the
ultra
conservatives
are
outright
reporting
things
like
Only
Sinners
Remain
Take
a
look
at
this
article
which
ends
with
We
must
not
forget
that
the
citizens
of
New
Orleans
tolerated
and
welcomed
the
wickedness
in
their
city
for
so
long
http://www.libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=107576
In
a
report
where
George
Bush
went
to
visit
the
survivors
he
is
shown
with
two
African
American
women
He
PUSHES
them
away
saying
yeah
i
understand
i
understand
go
over
there
they'll
help
you
The
mayor
of
the
city
a
prominent
African
American
man
is
outraged
and
screaming
What
is
wrong
with
these
people
Where
is
Bush
now
Well
he's
been
seen
in
remote
places
asking
people
to
give
money
to
the
Red
Cross
like
the
Red
Cross
conviniently
in
the
town
he
lives
in
D.C
The
President
is
more
worried
about
what
is
going
to
happen
to
his
oil
supply
Foreign
countries
are
offering
help
but
the
Federal
Government
is
saying
no
Argentina
offered
10
a
barrel
of
oil
and
the
U.S
said
no
Sri
Lanka
after
trying
to
deal
with
the
Tsunami
disaster
managed
to
give
24,000
The
U.S
is
saying
well
we
don't
need
it
We
DO
NEED
IT
And
if
we
didn't
can't
we
just
save
it
for
the
future
when
these
people
get
back
to
their
homes
and
try
to
find
a
job
A
rich
woman
from
up
north
tried
to
send
in
planes
with
supplies
to
help
the
people
in
New
Orleans
know
what
happened
She
wasn't
allowed
to
land
the
planes
and
help
out
not
even
drop
off
the
supplies
at
a
much
faster
rate
than
the
military
I
might
add
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
Please
realize
that
these
are
the
people
you
voted
into
office
the
Republican

Never
believed
they
were

Look
around

the

General
Wes
Clark
on
leadership
from
Kos
L]eadership
is
everything
we
are
not
getting
from
this
White
House
Instead
of
challenging
us
to
push
ourselves
to
accomplish
great
things
we
get
platitudes
We
can
do
better
than
that
I
hope
you
had
a
chance
to
read
today's
editorial
in
the
New
York
Times
called
Waiting
for
a
Leader
If
you
haven't
read
it
yet
please
take
a
few
minutes
to
do
it
The
Times
is
asking
an
important
question
It's
one
I've
been
asking
for
a
long
time
as
well
Where
is
the
leadership
in
America
today
J]ust
this
past
week
there
was
at
least
36
hours
notice
that
a
major
hurricane
was
going
to
hit
the
Gulf
Coast
including
likely
a
devastating
blow
to
New
Orleans
which
certainly
came
to
pass
The
President
continued
with
his
regular
schedule
on
Monday
and
Tuesday
in
California
Arizona
and
Texas
to
hold
some
staged
Medicare
events
and
enjoy
more
vacation
time
while
finally
returning
to
the
White
House
yesterday
The
joint
task
force
including
National
Guard
set
up
by
the
Pentagon
failed
to
be
on
the
scene
in
New
Orleans
in
a
timely
manner
to
stop
the
looting
and
assist
in
the
evacuation
Where
is
the
leadership
Then
just
this
morning
the
President
claimed
that
no
one
could
have
anticipated
the
levee
breaches
we've
seen
in
New
Orleans
after
Katrina
hit
That's
not
leadership
that's
an
excuse
In
fact
people
have
predicted
this
kind
of
disaster
for
many
years
including
President
Bush's
own
FEMA
in
2001
when
they
ranked
hurricane
flood
damage
to
New
Orleans
among
the
three
likeliest
most
catastrophic
disasters
facing
America
Instead
funding
was
significantly
cut
back
leaving
key
engineering
projects
on
hold
Instead
this
Administration
focused
on
the
war
in
Iraq
tax
cuts
and
private
sector
economic
growth
without
asking
the
American
people
to
make
needed
sacrifices
for
the
good
of
the
country
Again
I
ask
you
where
is
the
leadership
I
am
glad
I
voted
for
Clark
and
I
am
glad
he
is
speaking
up
Wesley
Clark's
Blog
The
link
to
the
FEMA
article
that
Clark
eluded
too
is
here
and
also
from
todays
press
conference
REPORTER
There's
a
lot
of
discussion
going
on
about
the
funding
of
projects
prior
to
this
whether
projects
in
New
Orleans
in
particular
were
underfunded
because
of
the
Iraq
war
or
for
other
reasons
Do
you
find
any
of
this
criticism
legitimate
Do
you
think
there
is
any
second
guessing
to
be
done
now
about
priorities
given
that
a
disaster
in
New
Orleans
was
sort
of
obvious
to
a
lot
of
the
experts
MCCLELLAN
As
I
have
indicated
this
is
not
a
time
for
politics
This
is
a
time
for
the
nation
to
come
together
for
those
in
the
Gulf
Coast
region
and
that's
where
our
focus
is
This
is
not
a
time
for
finger-pointing
or
politics
And
I
think
the
last
thing
that
the
people
who
have
been
displaced
or
the
people
who
have
been
affected
need
is
people
seeking
partisan
gain
in
Washington
So
if
that's
what
you're
talking
about
that's
one
thing
Now
if
you're
talking
about
specific
areas
I
would
be
glad
to
talk
about
some
of
those
if
that's
what
you
want

I'm

100
missing
in
boat
disaster
BOGOTA
Colombia
A
boat
carrying
more
than
100
illegal
immigrants
capsized
and
sank
in
rough
waters
in
the
Pacific
Ocean
and
only
nine
survivors
were
found
clinging
to
a
wooden
box
and
buoys
officials
said
Wednesday
Ecuadorean
Navy
Capt
Armando
Elizalde
told
Colombian
RCN
television
most
of
the
113
people
aboard
sank
with
the
boat
An
Ecuadorean
fishing
boat
found
the
survivors
seven
men
and
two
women
on
Sunday
Elizalde
said
They
were
later
transferred
to
an
Ecuadorean
Coast
Guard
cutter
The
Colombian
Navy
said
one
of
its
planes
and
a
boat
were
being
deployed
in
a
search-and-rescue
operation
Ecuador's
Coast
Guard
was
also
participating
So
the
biggest
thing
from
reading
this
article
is
Ecuador
has
a
Coast
Guard
why
the
fuck
do
they
need
to
protect
their
coasts
and
Colombia
has
a
navy
WHAT
Sad
but
true
Colombia
has
a
navy

One
thing
that
I
think
is
really
funny
is
when
you
have
to
go
to
secure
websites
that
force
you
to
use
internet
