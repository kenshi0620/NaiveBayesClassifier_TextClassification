What
is
Wrong
With
Socialism
Are
you
old
enough
to
remember
when
no
one
had
ever
seen
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
I
am
and
everyone
who
came
before
me
knew
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
as
as
a
place
just
out
of
reach
We
knew
it
was
there
but
could
never
see
it
It
was
a
profound
symbol
of
mystery
and
man's
limitations
Last
evening
while
we
were
carving
pumpkins
someone
played
a
song
that
mentioned
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
It
occurred
to
me
that
the
younger
members
of
our
party
might
knot
know
what
it
meant
I
asked
I
got
answers
like
It's
dark
and
It's
far
away
Nothing
even
close
Kyle-Anne
Shiver
writing
at
The
American
Thinker
encountered
the
same
thing
regarding
socialism
and
why
it
should
be
loathed
Shiver
attempts
to
explain
it
to
those
who
are
too
young
to
have
seen
socialism
in
action
The
American
Thinker
And
the
reasons
for
loathing
socialism
are
as
clear
as
the
nose
on
anyone's
face
No
fully-grown
human
being
with
a
single
ounce
of
self-respect
ever
wants
to
be
taken
care
of
by
others
No
person
with
dignity
will
tolerate
being
told
what
to
do
what
to
think
how
to
work
or
how
to
be
an
acceptable
person
No
free
man
or
woman
will
tolerate
the
loss
of
liberty
in
exchange
for
material
comfort
Many
generations
of
Americans
vehemently
rejected
these
notions
over
and
over
again
not
out
of
fear
but
out
of
the
kind
of
visceral
loathing
that
makes
a
normal
person
wretch
gag
and
grab
for
his
religion
and
his
guns
The
choice
we
are
facing
in
this
election
is
simple
We
have
freedom
only
when
we
accept
personal
responsibility
for
ourselves
and
our
children
If
we
want
to
divest
ourselves
from
the
responsibility
to
provide
for
ourselves
then
we
also
forfeit
our
freedom
to
make
our
own
decisions
Great
leaders
have
appeared
from
time
to
time
to
warn
free
people
of
the
innate
deceptiveness
of
the
socialists
lures
Ronald
Reagan
saw
the
evil
as
clear
as
day
Reagan's
ten
scariest
words
in
the
English
language
I'm
from
the
government
and
I'm
here
to
help
you
Winston
Churchill
expounded
further
on
leftist
ideology
Let
them
quit
these
gospels
of
envy
hate
and
malice
Let
them
eliminate
them
from
their
politics
and
programmes
Let
them
abandon
the
utter
fallacy
the
grotesque
erroneous
fatal
blunder
of
believing
that
by
limiting
the
enterprise
of
man
by
riveting
the
shackles
of
a
false
equality...they
will
increase
the
well-being
of
the
world
John
McCain
is
a
leader
in
the
same
mold
as
Reagan
and
Churchill
when
it
comes
to
seeing
the
innate
evil
within
the
Marxist
lure
and
its
deceptive
threat
to
real
peace
and
any
prosperity
worth
having
But
of
these
three
Reagan
Churchill
and
McCain
McCain
is
the
only
one
who
has
seen
firsthand
from
the
inside
how
it
is
that
collective
regimes
may
appear
fair
and
just
and
unified
Shiver
is
right
about
the
reasons
socialism
doesn't
work
It
works
against
the
basic
strengths
of
human
beings
Because
of
this
it
will
always
fail
But
it
will
be
tried
over
and
over
again
because
it
indulges
our
weakness
for
wanting
to
feel
good
about
ourselves
by
taking
care
of
others
with
as
little
personal
effort
as
possible

Obama's
Numbers
Just
Don't
Add
Up
This
from
of
all
places
CBS
News
Without
question
the
Barack
Obama
infomercial
served
as
a
very
slick
and
powerful
recitation
of
the
biggest
promises
he's
made
as
a
presidential
candidate
But
the
very
bigness
of
his
ideas
is
the
problem
he
seems
blind
to
the
concept
his
numbers
don't
add
up
If
he
closes
every
loophole
as
promised
saves
every
dime
from
Iraq
raises
taxes
on
the
rich
and
trims
the
federal
budget
as
he's
promised
to
do
line
by
line
he
still
doesn't
pay
for
his
list
It's
obvious
to
even
the
most
casual
observer
But
numbers
and
other
facts
don't
seem
to
matter
to
the
average
Obama
supporter
so
I
doubt
this
will
make
any
difference
to
them
Despite
the
fact
it
comes
from
an
Obama-friendly
source
like

Davey
Crockett
and
The
Farmer
At
this
time
while
we
are
facing
the
possibility
of
an
unchecked
Democratically
controlled
government
a
famous
story
about
congressman
Davey
Crockett
comes
to
mind
The
story
may
true
or
not
either
way
it
is
an
eloquent
defense
of
a
constitutional
approach
to
government
social
spending
Not
Yours
to
Give
by
Colonel
David
Crockett
Compiled
by
Edward
S
Ellis
One
day
in
the
House
of
Representatives
a
bill
was
taken
up
appropriating
money
for
the
benefit
of
a
widow
of
a
distinguished
naval
officer
Several
beautiful
speeches
had
been
made
in
its
support
The
Speaker
was
just
about
to
put
the
question
when
Crockett
arose
Mr
Speaker--I
have
as
much
respect
for
the
memory
of
the
deceased
and
as
much
sympathy
for
the
sufferings
of
the
living
if
suffering
there
be
as
any
man
in
this
House
but
we
must
not
permit
our
respect
for
the
dead
or
our
sympathy
for
a
part
of
the
living
to
lead
us
into
an
act
of
injustice
to
the
balance
of
the
living
I
will
not
go
into
an
argument
to
prove
that
Congress
has
no
power
to
appropriate
this
money
as
an
act
of
charity
Every
member
upon
this
floor
knows
it
We
have
the
right
as
individuals
to
give
away
as
much
of
our
own
money
as
we
please
in
charity
but
as
members
of
Congress
we
have
no
right
so
to
appropriate
a
dollar
of
the
public
money
Some
eloquent
appeals
have
been
made
to
us
upon
the
ground
that
it
is
a
debt
due
the
deceased
Mr
Speaker
the
deceased
lived
long
after
the
close
of
the
war
he
was
in
office
to
the
day
of
his
death
and
I
have
never
heard
that
the
government
was
in
arrears
to
him
Every
man
in
this
House
knows
it
is
not
a
debt
We
cannot
without
the
grossest
corruption
appropriate
this
money
as
the
payment
of
a
debt
We
have
not
the
semblance
of
authority
to
appropriate
it
as
a
charity
Mr
Speaker
I
have
said
we
have
the
right
to
give
as
much
money
of
our
own
as
we
please
I
am
the
poorest
man
on
this
floor
I
cannot
vote
for
this
bill
but
I
will
give
one
week's
pay
to
the
object
and
if
every
member
of
Congress
will
do
the
same
it
will
amount
to
more
than
the
bill
asks
He
took
his
seat
Nobody
replied
The
bill
was
put
upon
its
passage
and
instead
of
passing
unanimously
as
was
generally
supposed
and
as
no
doubt
it
would
but
for
that
speech
it
received
but
few
votes
and
of
course
was
lost
Later
when
asked
by
a
friend
why
he
had
opposed
the
appropriation
Crockett
gave
this
explanation
Several
years
ago
I
was
one
evening
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
Capitol
with
some
other
members
of
Congress
when
our
attention
was
attracted
by
a
great
light
over
in
Georgetown
It
was
evidently
a
large
fire
We
jumped
into
a
hack
and
drove
over
as
fast
as
we
could
In
spite
of
all
that
could
be
done
many
houses
were
burned
and
many
families
made
homeless
and
besides
some
of
them
had
lost
all
but
the
clothes
they
had
on
The
weather
was
very
cold
and
when
I
saw
so
many
women
and
children
suffering
I
felt
that
something
ought
to
be
done
for
them
The
next
morning
a
bill
was
introduced
appropriating
20,000
for
their
relief
We
put
aside
all
other
business
and
rushed
it
through
as
soon
as
it
could
be
done
The
next
summer
when
it
began
to
be
time
to
think
about
the
election
I
concluded
I
would
take
a
scout
around
among
the
boys
of
my
district
I
had
no
opposition
there
but
as
the
election
was
some
time
off
I
did
not
know
what
might
turn
up
When
riding
one
day
in
a
part
of
my
district
in
which
I
was
more
of
a
stranger
than
any
other
I
saw
a
man
in
a
field
plowing
and
coming
toward
the
road
I
gauged
my
gait
so
that
we
should
meet
as
he
came
to
the
fence
As
he
came
up
I
spoke
to
the
man
He
replied
politely
but
as
I
thought
rather
coldly
I
began
Well
friend
I
am
one
of
those
unfortunate
beings
called
candidates
and
Yes
I
know
you
you
are
Colonel
Crockett
I
have
seen
you
once
before
and
voted
for
you
the
last
time
you
were
elected
I
suppose
you
are
out
electioneering
now
but
you
had
better
not
waste
your
time
or
mine
I
shall
not
vote
for
you
again
This
was
a
sockdolager
I
begged
him
to
tell
me
what
was
the
matter

Obama
Accepting
Untraceable
Donations
With
the
heavy
lifting
already
done
by
sites
like
Obama
Shrugged
the
Mainstream
Media
is
finally
taking
notice
of
irregularities
in
the
way
Senator
Obama
is
accepting
contributions
WaPo
Sen
Barack
Obama's
presidential
campaign
is
allowing
donors
to
use
largely
untraceable
prepaid
credit
cards
that
could
potentially
be
used
to
evade
limits
on
how
much
an
individual
is
legally
allowed
to
give
or
to
mask
a

Faced
with
a
huge
influx
of
donations
over
the
Internet
the
campaign
has
also
chosen
not
to
use
basic
security
measures
to
prevent
potentially
illegal
or
anonymous
contributions
from
flowing
into
its
accounts
aides
acknowledged
Instead
the
campaign
is
scrutinizing
its
books
for
improper
donations
after
the
money
has
been
deposited
In
recent
weeks
questionable
contributions
have
created
headaches
for
Obama's
accounting
team
as
it
has
tried
to
explain
why
campaign
finance
filings
have
included
itemized
donations
from
individuals
using
fake
names
such
as
Es
Esh
or
Doodad
Pro
Those
revelations
prompted
conservative
bloggers
to
further
test
Obama's
finance
vetting
by
giving
money
using
the
kind
of
prepaid
cards
that
can
be
bought
at
a
drugstore
and
cannot
be
traced
to
a
donor
The
problem
with
such
cards
campaign
finance
lawyers
said
is
that
they
make
it
impossible
to
tell
whether
foreign
nationals
donors
who
have
exceeded
the
limits
government
contractors
or
others
who
are
barred
from
giving
to
a
federal
campaign
are
making
contributions
The
Obama
team's
disclosures
came
in
response
to
questions
from
The
Washington
Post
about
the
case
of
Mary
T
Biskup
a
retired
insurance
manager
from
Manchester
Mo
who
turned
up
on
Obama's
FEC
reports
as
having
donated
174,800
to
the
campaign
Contributors
are
limited
to
giving
2,300
for
the
general
election
Biskup
who
had
scores
of
Obama
contributions
attributed
to
her
said
in
an
interview
that
she
never
donated
to
the
candidate
That's
an
error
she
said
Moreover
she
added
her
credit
card
was
never
billed
for
the
donations
meaning
someone
appropriated
her
name
and
made
the
contributions
with
another
card
In
fact
both
Visa
and
Mastercard
offer
Address
Verification
Services
AVS
as
part
of
their
front
line
of
security
services
for
CNP
card
not
present
transactions
There
is
really
no
excuse
for
allowing
the
kind
of
untraceable
donations
that
the
Obama
campaign
is
accepting
There
is
an
explanation
but
not
an
excuse

RE
State
of
the
Race
and
Ballot
Position
DATE
October
28
2008
First
let's
be
clear
This
is
a
hard
election
to
predict
The
historic
nature
of
the
candidates
on
both
tickets
the
huge
influx
of
unregulated
money
by
the
Obama
campaign
the
dour
public
mood
and
the
unique
level
of
voter
interest
all
suggest
an
historic
level
of
turn-out
not
witnessed
in
over
40
years
Our
models/understanding
of
what
is
coming
is
therefore
necessarily
projective
but
here
is
what
we
know
for
sure
The
McCain
campaign
has
made
impressive
strides
over
the
last
week
of
tracking
The
campaign
is
functionally
tied
across
the
battleground
states
with
our
numbers
IMPROVING
sharply
over
the
last
four
tracks
The
key
number
in
our
mind
is
Senator
Obama's
level
of
support
and
the
margin
difference
between
the
two
candidates
As
other
public
polls
begin
to
show
Senator
Obama
dropping
below
50
and
the
margin
over
McCain
beginning
to
approach
margin
of
error
with
a
week
left
all
signs
say
we
are
headed
to
an
election
that
may
easily
be
too
close
to
call
by
next
Tuesday
1
We
are
witnessing
a
significant
shift
across
the
battleground
states
The
race
has
moved
significantly
over
the
past
week
closing
to
essentially
tied
on
the
last
two-day
roll
These
gains
are
coming
from
sub-groups
it
should
be
possible
to
sustain
over
the
next
week
including
Non-college
men
Rural
voters
both
men
and
women
Right-to-life
voters
and
most
encouragingly
We
are
beginning
to
once
again
get
over
a
20
chunk
of
the
vote
among
soft
Democrats
Importantly
as
well
our
long
identified
target
of
Walmart
women
those
women
without
a
college
degree
in
households
under
60,000
a
year
in
income
are
also
swinging
back
solidly
in
our
direction
Finally
in
terms
of
critical
improvement
even
as
this
track
shows
more
Republicans
voting
for
us
than
Democrats
supporting
Obama
we
are
witnessing
an
impressive
pop
with
Independent
voters
As
I
said
during
our
Sunday
briefing
we
do
substantially
more
interviews
per
day
than
any
public
poll
but
given
the
shift
we
were
witnessing
it
was
my
expectation
that
by
Tuesday/Wednesday
multiple
public
polls
would
show
the
race
closing
A
quick
glance
at
Real
Clear
Politics
would
indicate
this
is
happening
by
today
Tuesday
and
that's
good
2
It
is
not
surprising
we
are
witnessing
this
closing
as
we
are
finally
having
an
opportunity
to
run
a
campaign
that
focuses
on
Senator
Obama's
record
on
taxes
and
his
lack
of
experience
We
are
tracking
how
much
people
have
seen
read
or
heard
about
a
number
of
thematic
elements
from
both
campaigns
including
the
false
charges
about
Senator
McCain's
health
care
plan
being
out
of
touch
on
the
economy
and
the
Obama's
campaign
charges
about
Medicare
At
the
same
time
we
are
testing
awareness
of
Joe
the
Plumber
Senator's
Biden's
quote
about
his
own
running
mate
being
so
inexperienced
it
invites
being
tested
by
our
enemies
around
the
world
and
Obama's
proposals
that
will
raise
federal
spending
by
a
trillion
dollars
This
has
been
the
week
where
Joe
the
Plumber
has
literally
become
a
household
name
An
astounding
59
of
voters
in
these
battleground
states
have
heard
a
lot
about
this
story
83
have
heard
a
lot
or
some
about
this
episode
The
59
a
lot
dwarfs
the
other
stories/thematic
elements
we
are
tracking
this
week
The
campaign's
relentless
focus
has
helped
strengthen
our
margins
on
the
issue
of
taxes
and
broadened
as
well
to
the
attribute
of
handling
the
economy
and
jobs
3
Our
opponent
is
being
correctly
perceived
as
the
most
liberal
nominee
in
modern
times
In
our
tracking
now
59
of
battleground
voters
describe
Senator
Obama
as
being
a
liberal
a
percentage
that
is
higher
than
previous
Democrat
losers
Gore/Kerry
and
significantly
higher
than
for
President
Clinton
and
President
Carter
A
majority
54
of
voters
profile
as
saying
Senator
Obama
is
more
liberal
than
they
see
themselves
politically
As
Senator
Obama's
profile
as
a
liberal
increases
it
has
helped
further
erode
his
support
among
key
sub-groups
4
Turn-out
IS
going
to
go
through
the
roof
Public
Opinion
Strategies
has
been
using
a
1
to
10
scale
to
help
look
at
self-described
interest
in
the
election
since
1993
In
1996
in
our
last
track
48
of
voters
described
their
interest
in
the
election
as
a
10
In
2000
the
last
track
was
54
saying
10
Remarkably
in
2004
our
last
track
had
self-described
10s
at
75
of
the
electorate
You
need
to
understand
we
are
witnessing
a
day-to-day
trend
of
serious
magnitude
as
self-described
10s
increase
in
every
roll
Last
night
81
of
voters
described
their
interest
in
this
election
as
a
10
Wow
Here
is
the
importance
of
this
number
We
have
watched
as
turn-out
has
gone
up
in
the
last
three
presidential
elections
from
roughly
96
million
voters
in
1996
to
104
million
voters
in
2000
to
a
whopping
122
million
voters
in
2004
I
now
believe
turn-out
will
begin
to
approach
levels
not
seen
since
other
comparable
presidential
campaigns
in
1960
and
1968
In
today's
terms
that
could
mean
breaking
the
barrier
of
130
million
voters
There
is
simply
no
model
that
begins
to
know
or
predict
the
composition
of
the
electorate
at
this
level
of
turn-out
My
own
view
and
our
own
weights
in
our
surveys
reflect
a
belief
that
African
American
turn-out
will
be
at
historic
levels
there
will
be
a
significant
boost
with
voters
18
to
29
years
old
yet
the
overall
high
level
of
turn-out
will
begin
to
mute
the
increase
in
the
percentage
these
sub-groups
represent
in
the
overall
electorate
5
There
is
more
elasticity
in
this
campaign
than
is
imagined
We
have
merged
all
of
our
interviews
over
the
last
three
plus
weeks
to
identify
undecided
and
respondents
who
refuse
to
respond
on
the
ballot
question
This
can
be
as
high
as
one
out
of
ten
voters
but
is
generally
about
eight
percent
8
of
the
electorate
in
battleground
states
These
voters
might
generally
be
non-voters
in
most
cycles
But
in
this
cycle
61
describe
their
interest
in
the
election
as
a
10
This
is
higher
than
the
last
track
among
ALL
voters
in
1996
and
2000
These
voters
are
older
downscale
more
rural
and
are
certainly
economically
stressed
They
are
quite
negative
about
the
direction
of
country
and
seek
change
They
voted
for
Bush
over
Kerry
by
a
margin
of
47
to
24
and
this
partisan
advantage
is
a
critical
element
to
understanding
our
capacity
to
get
these
voters
They
have
significant
hesitations
about
Senator
Obama's
experience
and
judgment
Given
an
Obama
TV
media
barrage
we
have
not
witnessed
since
the
last
candidate
to
run
without
public
financing
Richard
Nixon
in
1972
and
the
daily
drumbeat
about
Obama's
chances
given
their
demographics
it
is
my
sense
these
voters
WILL
vote
in
this
election
and
WILL
break
decisively
in
our
direction
These
undecided/refuse
to
respond
voters
breaking
decisively
against
Senator
Obama
mirrors
the
pattern
of
the
last
two
months
of
the
Democrat
primary
season
When
they
do
break
I
believe
they
will
add
a
net
three
plus
points
to
our
margins
6
I
am
becoming
more
and
more
convinced
Senator
Obama
gets
what
he
gets
in
the
tracking
Typically
a
Republican
candidate
trails
among
African
Americans
on
a
survey
by
a
margin
of
something
like
78
to
14
As
a
firm
we
consistently
warn
our
clients
that
on
Election
Day
they
will
underperform
their
polling
margins
with
African
American
voters
If
their
tracking
says
78
18
they
should
expect
to
only
carry
8
of
the
African
American
vote
as
the
Democrat
candidate
will
typically
carry
more
than
90
of
the
African
American
vote
Senator
Obama's
numbers
are
different
than
anything
we
have
ever
seen
before
among
African
Americans
In
most
polls
McCain
is
losing
these
African
American
voters
by
margins
like
97
to
1
This
means
when
you
see
Senator
Obama's
number
in
a
survey
it
already
reflects
his
significant
and
full
support
among
African
American
voters
Functionally
this
means
the
only
undecided/refuse
to
respond
voters
are
white
and
Latino
So
in
a
state
like
Indiana
where
he
has
recently
led
Senator
McCain
in
most
tracks
Senator
Obama
is
at
46
to
47
of
the
vote
I
am
becoming
increasingly
persuaded
it
will
be
very
difficult
for
Senator
Obama
to
perform
much
above
his
percentage
of
the
vote
in
a
state
This
puts
any
number
of
historically
red
states
very
much
in
play
and
MUCH
more
competitive
than
is
generally
believed
by
the
media
But
critically
as
Obama
drops
below
50
in
other
blue
states
some
of
these
states
may
also
becoming
back
in
play
as
well
In
a
nutshell
their
internal
polling
shows
a
tied
race
with
McCain
trending
up
But
the
results
are
difficult
to
predict

Global
Warming
Amy
Ridnenour
at
the
National
Center
for
Public
Policy
Research
points
us
to
this
article
by
Lorne
Guntner
in
The
National
Post
Don
Easterbrook
a
geologist
at
Western
Washington
University
says
It's
practically
a
slam
dunk
that
we
are
in
for
about
30
years
of
global
cooling
as
the
sun
enters
a
particularly
inactive
phase
His
examination
of
warming
and
cooling
trends
over
the
past
four
centuries
shows
an
almost
exact
correlation
between
climate
fluctuations
and
solar
energy
received
on
Earth
while
showing
almost
no
correlation
at
all
with
CO2
An
analytical
chemist
who
works
in
spectroscopy
and
atmospheric
sensing
Michael
J
Myers
of
Hilton
Head
S
C
declared
Man-made
global
warming
is
junk
science
explaining
that
worldwide
manmade
CO2
emission
each
year
equals
about
0.0168
of
the
atmosphere's
CO2
concentration
This
results
in
a
0.00064
increase
in
the
absorption
of
the
sun's
radiation
This
is
an
insignificantly
small
number
Other
international
scientists
have
called
the
manmade
warming
theory
a
hoax
a
fraud
and
simply
not
credible
While
not
stooping
to
such
name-calling
weather-satellite
scientists
David
Douglass
of
the
University
of
Rochester
and
John
Christy
of
the
University
of
Alabama
at
Huntsville
nonetheless
dealt
the
True
Believers
a
devastating
blow
last
month
For
nearly
30
years
Professor
Christy
has
been
in
charge
of
NASA's
eight
weather
satellites
that
take
more
than
300,000
temperature
readings
daily
around
the
globe
In
a
paper
co-written
with
Dr
Douglass
he
concludes
that
while
manmade
emissions
may
be
having
a
slight
impact
variations
in
global
temperatures
since
1978
cannot
be
attributed
to
carbon
dioxide
Moreover
while
the
chart
below
was
not
produced
by
Douglass
and
Christy
it
was
produced
using
their
data
and
it
clearly
shows
that
in
the
past
four
years
the
period
corresponding
to
reduced
solar
activity
all
of
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
since
1979
has
disappeared
It
may
be
that
more
global
warming
doubters
are
surfacing
because
there
just
isn't
any
global
warming
Here
is
the
chart
that
is
referred
to
It
shows
that
global
temperatures
are
falling
and
have
been
since
2005
and
that
we
are
at
the
same
temperature
as
we
were
in
1979
Personally
I
have
enjoyed
the
gradual
warming
that
occurred
over
the
last
20
years
and
would
be
sad
to
see
it
go

It

She

Maybe
there
is

Republican
who
needs
her
help

Why
is
the
LA
Times
hiding
that
tape
Doug
Ross
got
this
from
a
purported
secret
source
in
LA
However
I
received
a
tip
from
a
person
who
has
provided
useful
accurate
and
unique
data
from
LA
before
e.g
All
six
of
CNN's
undecided
voters
were
Democratic
operatives
Take
it
for
what
it's
worth
but
I
believe
this
person
is
on
target
Saw
a
clip
from
the
tape
Reason
we
can't
release
it
is
because
statements
Obama
said
to
rile
audience
up
during
toast
He
congratulates
Khalidi
for
his
work
saying
Israel
has
no
God-given
right
to
occupy
Palestine
plus
there's
been
genocide
against
the
Palestinian
people
by
Israelis
It
would
be
really
controversial
if
it
got
out
Tha's
why
they
will
not
even
let
a
transcript
get
out
No
way
to
test
the
veracity
of
this
information
yet
Treat
it
with
skepticism

The
Three
Tenors
of
Talk
Last
evening
my
wife
Karen
and
I
along
with
my
inlaws
Linda
and
Gene
and
Ed
Morrissey
Hotair.com
and
his
First
Mate
Marsha
attended
an
event
at
Minnesota's
Orchestra
Hall
It
was
billed
as
Talk
The
Vote
and
featured
Hugh
Hewitt
Michael
Medved
and
Dennis
Prager
It
was
primarily
a
pump
up
the
base
event
designed
to
bolster
the
faithful
Since
all
three
men
are
gifted
speakers
as
well
as
solid
thinkers
the
base
was
indeed
pumped
The
audience's
respect
and
admiration
for
as
Hewitt
called
them
the
Three
Tenors
of
Talk
was
apparent
from
the
immediate
multiple
spontaneous
standing
ovations
each
received
Ed's
contacts
with
AM
1280
The
Patriot
where
he
has
a
weekly
radio
show
with
his
Northern
Alliance
Radio
Network
cohorts
enabled
us
to
have
VIP
tickets
We
sat
second
row
center
Perfect
The
VIP
Ticket
Before
it
began
Ed
interviewed
someone
I
should
know
but
can't
quite
place
It's
kind
of
driving
me
nuts
I'll
update
when
I
figure
it
out
James
Lileks
was
Hewitt's
private
MC
Hugh
introduced
the
Three
Tenors
of
Talk
Michael
Medved
Dennis
Prager
brought
out
some
guy
who
wanted
to
give
him
a
cigar
Minnesota
Governor
Tim
Pawlenty
Senator
Norm
Coleman
was
there
He
seems
to
be
a
very
good
man
Congressman
Michelle
Bachman
was
there
Sorry
I
took
the
photos
with
my
cell
phone
Ed
monitored
one
of
the
microphones
for
people
who
had
questions
It
was
interesting
being
in
a
room
with
3000
Republicans
in
Minnesota
that's
a
rarity
My
thanks
to
Ed
Morrissey
AM
1280
and
RightChange.com
their
co-sponser
of
the
event
Fun
was
had
by
all
Update
Ed
has
posted
the
video
he
shot
last
night
in
two
seperate
posts
The
first
contains
the
speeches
of
Hewitt
Medved
and
Prager
The
second
is
video
of
the
political
candidates
in
attendance
Coleman
Bachman
and
Pawlenty
Both
are
well
worth
viewing
all
of
the
speeches
are
worth
the
time
but
if
you
are
only
going
to
listen
to
one
I'd
recommend
Prager
Update
Duh
It's
Hinderaker
Update
Hello
Hot
Air
readers
If
you
didn't
already
do
it
you
should
take
the
time
to
go
back
and
actually
watch
Ed's
videos
of
the
Three
Tenors
of
Talk
They
will
lift
your
spirits
and
remind
you
why
you
are
a
conservative

Bill

reports
sad
news
It's
my
sad
duty
to
report
that
our
good
friend
and
valued
contributor
Dean
Barnett
passed
away
today
He
was
a
remarkable
man--principled
witty
and
to
all
of
us
a
model
of
grace
and
courage
We
mourn
his
passing
and
cherish
his
memory
I
love
the
Hugh
Hewitt
show
but
I
always
looked
forward
to
the
days
when
Dean
would
fill
in
for
Hugh
He
was
relentlessly
cheerful
remarkably
perceptive
and
I
loved
his
beautiful
Boston
accent
I
am
saddened
to
see
him
go
but
I
am
confident
that
a
better
life
awaits

Obama
In
His
Own
Words
Heres
is
the
video
really
just
an
audio
clip
of
an
interview
that
then
Illinois
State
Senator
Obama
gave
to
Chicago
Public
Radio
in
2001
Via
Michelle
Malkin
To
say
that
I
underestimated
just
how
far
left
Obama
really
is
causes
me
a
bit
of
a
shock
I
wouldn't
have
thought
it
possible
In
this
interview
Obama
displays
definite
Marxist
leanings
and
a
very
disturbing
view
of
the
Constitution
He
reaffirms
indeed
fleshes
out
his
Joe
the
Plumber/Redistribution
answer
showing
it
to
be
much
more
than
a
gaff
And
he
calls
for
the
Constitution
which
he
says
is
flawed
for
its
lack
of
redistributionist
provisions
to
be
overhauled
by
activist
judges
He
criticizes
the
Supreme
Court
for
never
having
reinterpreted
the
Constitution
in
order
to
mandate
the
redistribution
of
wealth
and
for
not
having
broken
free
from
the
essential
constraints
that
were
placed
by
the
founding
Fathers
in
the
constitution
Redistribution
for
Senator
Obama
is
not
a
subject
for
debate
it
is
the
centerpiece
of
his
political
philosophy

Obama
Tax
Increases
for
All
Ned
Barnett
writing
at
The
American
Thinker
has
analyzed
Senator
Obama's
tax
policy
promises
and
found
four
tax
increases
big
tax
increases
for
people
earning
under
250,000
He
even
found
tax
increases
for
those
earning
as
little
as
25,000
Ned
Barnett
I've
worked
as
the
state
level
media
and
strategy
director
on
three
Presidential
election
campaigns
I
know
how
promises
work
so
I
analyzed
Senator
Obama's
promises
by
looking
for
loopholes
The
first
loophole
was
easy
to
find
Senator
Obama
doesn't
count
allowing
the
Bush
tax
cuts
to
lapse
as
a
tax
increase
Unless
the
cuts
are
re-enacted
rates
will
automatically
return
to
the
2000
level
Senator
Obama
claims
that
letting
a
tax
cut
lapse
allowing
the
rates
to
return
to
a
higher
levels
is
not
actually
a
tax
increase
It's
just
the
lapsing
of
a
tax
cut
See
the
difference
Neither
do
I
100
of
those
Americans
who
pay
Federal
income
tax
will
be
affected
by
this
increase
Just
this
one
increase
will
cost
my
family
nearly
4000
It
ain't

Racism
There
is
no
other
name
for
it
Jonathon
Valania
in
an
editorial
published
shamefully
by
the
Philledelphia
Inquirer
shows
a
level
of
self
loathing
that
is
rare
even
among
liberals
White
people
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
vote
As
a
lifelong
Caucasian
I
am
beginning
to
think
the
time
has
finally
come
to
take
the
right
to
vote
away
from
white
people
at
least
until
we
come
to
our
senses
Seriously
I
just
don't
think
we
can
be
trusted
to
exercise
it
responsibly
anymore
These
people
are
ruining
things
for
the
rest
of
us
white
people
who
are
ready
to
move
on
Sure
they
have
their
reasons
chimerical
though
they
may
be
He's
a
Muslim
He's
a
terrorist
He's
a
Muslim
terrorist
He's
going
to
fire
all
the
white
people
and
give
their
jobs
to
blacks
That's
why
this
ban
on
white
people
voting
I'm
proposing
has
got
to
be
statewide
And
I'm
sorry
to
say
it's
going
to
have
to
include
all
white
people
even
those
who
would
vote
for
Obama
because
you
can't
just
let
some
white
people
vote
That
would
be
unfair.I
guess
when
you
vote
for
someone
because
of
the
color
of
their
skin
you
imagine
that
people
voting
against
them
are
voting
against
the
color
of
their
skin
in
the
same
way
that
I
tend
to
assume
perhaps
erroneously
that
most
people
vote
based
on
the
issues
From
inside
Valania's
cloud
of
self-hate
it
must
be
nearly
impossible
to
see
that
there
are
idological
differences
between
Barrak
Obama
and
John
McCain
that
are
the
real
reason
half
of
the
nation
prefers
the
candidate
who
is
not
balanced
precariously
on
the
leftmost
edge
of
the
political
spectrum
Regardless
of
the
reasons
for
Valania's
hate-filled
harangue
he
should
be
ashamed
of
it
I
do
not
like
so
many
on
the
left
call
for
this
kind
of
disgraceful
commentary
to
be
censored
On
the
contrary
it
should
be
widely
disseminated
To
shed
light
on
the
twisted
musings
of
radical
so-called-thinkers
is
a
valuable
service
I
doubt
however
that
that
was
the
intention
of
the
Inquirer
when
they
chose
to
publish
Mr
Valania's
racist
essay

Chalk
that
up
as

I
never

I'd

The

likely
to
endorse
Republican
Senator
Norm
Coleman
as
the
New

Times
is
to
endorse
George

for

term
But
they
did
it
Michael
Broadkorb
a
blogger
who
is
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
Minnesota
DFL
found
an
early
edition
of
tomorrow's
paper
and
there
it
was
Minnesota
Democrats
Exposed
I
visited
numerous
gas
stations
this
morning
trying
to
locate
an
early
edition
of
the
Sunday
Star
Tribune
newspaper
On
my
third
try
I
found
the
newspaper
and
read
the
unbelievable
news
U.S
Senator
Norm
Coleman
was
endorsed
by
the
Star
Tribune
From
the
endorsement
Independent
judgment
excercised
on
behalf
of
the
special
interest
of
the
country
and
state
is
what
we
hope
to
see
from
our
U.S
Senators
With
that
hope
in
mind
this
newspaper
recommend
the
reelection
of
Republican
U.S
Sen
Norm
Coleman
Source
Star
Tribune
October
26
2008
There's
still
no
link
to
it
on
the
StarTrib
Editorial
page
but
if
you
search
Coleman
endorsed
you
can
find
it
After
listing
several
instances
where
Coleman
stood
up
to
President
Bush
or
voted
for
Democrat's
pet
projects
the
STrib
offered
this
assessment
Editorial
Norm
Coleman
for
Senate
Coleman
didn't
begin
his
Senate
service
as
an
agent
of
bipartisanship
But
that's
the
note
on
which
he
wound
up
his
six-year
term
and
which
he
has
sounded
repeatedly
in
his
reelection
campaign
We
like
the
trend
we've
seen
and
believe
Coleman
is
capable
of
taking
it
further
So
realism
from
the
Star
Trib
that's
unexpected
too
Sounds
like
they're
counting
on
the
oft
noted
leftward
creep
among
politicians
living
in
Washington
And
it
probably
makes
them
feel
better
that
Coleman
began
his
career
as
a
Democrat
Though
I
started
out
as
a
Democrat
too
And
so
did
Ronald
Regan
Maybe
leftward
creep
isn't
a
given
Update
Ed
Morrissey
has
this
to
say
Hot
Air
How
badly
does
this
hurt
Franken
He's
been
trying
to
paint
Coleman
as
a
lackey
of
George
Bush
and
an
extremist
which
has
always
been
a
ridiculous
position
one
that
even
a
DFL-friendly
outfit
like
the
Star
Tribune
can't
quite
swallow
it
Note
too
that
the
Strib
could
just
as
easily
have
endorsed
independent
candidate
Dean
Barkley
or
refrained
from
any
endorsement
at
all
Instead
by
backing
Coleman
they
may
have
put
the
final
nail
in
Franken's
coffin
