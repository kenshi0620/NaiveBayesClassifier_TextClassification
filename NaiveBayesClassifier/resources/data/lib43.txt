THIS
New
Rule
From
now
on
undecided
voters
who
are
still
undecided
after
both
the
conventions
and
the
debates
should
no
longer
be
labeled
as
undecideds
They
should
be
labeled
contrarians
Anyone
who
claims
to
not
know
what
the
candidates
stand
for
or
who
claim
that
they
never
hear
any
specifics
on
policy
and
when
they
do
get
both
they
claim
that
they're
not
learning
anything
new
they're
not
being
selective
or
prudent
or
equivocal
They're
being

Executive
Experience
Part
II
Following
up
on
something
I
wrote
last
night
here
are
a
few
examples
of
Sarah
Palin's
executive
acumen
More
than
100
appointments
to
state
posts
nearly
1
in
4
went
to
campaign
contributors
or
their
relatives
sometimes
without
apparent
regard
to
qualifications
Alaska
historians
say
some
of
Palin's
appointees
were
less
qualified
than
those
of
her
Republican
and
Democratic
predecessors
Tom
Lamal
a
public
school
teacher
in
Fairbanks
until
he
retired
in
2006
was
hired
as
a
right-of-way
agent
despite
reports
of
internal
conflicts
over
whether
he
was
qualified
under
state
law
Awesome
To
repeat
it's
the
quality
of
the
experience
that
matters
and
sometimes
sorry
Palin
that
quality
can
also
be
illustrated
in
non-executive
roles

The
Next
McCain
Surrogate
ABC
News
is
reporting
that
Bin
Laden
could
release
a
new
tape
any
day
now
Four
years
ago
when
Bin
Laden
released
a
message
just
before
the
election
it
definitely
helped
President
Bush's
chances
But
I
always
thought
that
Americans
should've
been
seriously
pissed
off
by
that
message
Bin
Laden
was
still
alive
Why
didn't
everyone
say
Dammit
Why
is
this
guy
still
at
large
and
why
hasn't
our
president
captured
him
dead
or
alive
like
he
promised
Of
course
I
underestimated
how
irrationally
fearful
certain
Americans
were
Here's
to
hoping
that
they've
come
to
their
senses
a

Oh
Justice
Could
you
be
any
more
poetic
I
consider
comedian
Rush
Limbaugh
to
be
one
of
the
most
excremental
human
beings
living
I'm
not
going
to
beat
around
the
bush
he's
quite
simply
a
virulent
pustule
of
hate
and
bigotry
who
gets
paid
to
be
an
enormous
cocksucker
and
by
enormous
I
mean
he's
immensely
fat
and
grotesque
And
one
of
the
many
many
reasons
I
detest
this
gormless
pile
of
pig
shit
was
his
hateful
soulless
and
inexplicably
cruel
attack
on
the
memorial
services
held
for
Minnesota
Senator
Paul
Wellstone
who
died
in
a
tragic
plane
crash
with
his
wife
and
one
of
his
three
kids
in
2002
just
11
days
before
his
potential
reelection
to
the
Senate
To
really
appreciate
how
badly
Al
Franken
needs
to
crush
Norm
Coleman's
nutsac
in
his
race
for
Wellstone's
old
Senate
seat
you
must
read
Mr
Franken's
account
of
the
Wellstone
memorial
in
his
wonderful
book
Lies
And
the
Lying
Liars
Who
Tell
Them
where
he
mercilessly
deconstructs
Limbaugh's
and
the
rest
of
the
rabid
Right's
attack
on
the
event
and
makes
Rush
look
like
an
even
bigger
sack
of
monkey
spunk
than
he
is
But
now
Limbaugh
can
eat
it
big
time
because
there's
no
sweeter

than
the
Poetic
sort

Marginalize

This
When
I
wrote
my
Huffington
Post
column
yesterday
The
Mandatory
Rejection
of
Sarah
Palin
this
is
the
kind
of
attitude
I
was
referring
to
It's
not
that
he's
black
Jim
insisted
But
it's
what
the
blacks
will
do
if
he
wins
that's
what
bothers
me
If
Obama
wins
the
blacks
are
gonna
say
We're
taking
charge
he's
our
president
You
know
how
they
get
We
don't
know
Jim
Tell
us
how
that
works
In
Massachusetts
where
Deval
Patrick
is
governor
have
there
been
race
riots
or
African
Americans
demanding
that
white
people
genuflect
at
their
feet
Was
it
that
way
in
Virginia
when
Doug
Wilder
was
governor
Did
it
happen
when
Colin
Powell
became
the
first
African
American
Secretary
of
State
Or
when
Thurgood
Marshall
was
appointed
to
the
Bench
Nope
nope
nope
and

But
I
seem
to
recall
that
shortly
after
the
election
of
George
W

redneck
culture
and
its
accompanying
simplistic
ignorant
knee-jerk

were

absolute
crap
that

craven
venal

eye
do
this
with
your

if
you're

and
say
Please

in

our

Americans
are
losing
jobs
and
health
care
and
educational
opportunities
and
homes
and

These
are
FACTS

starts
with

facts
See
if

that
these
facts
are
indeed
factual
Then
move
to
the
other
set
of
FACTS
Barack
Obama
is
a
Christian
not
a
Muslim
check
it
out
on
snopes
Barack
Obama
is
a
Democratic
Capitalist
not
a
Socialist
Barack
Obama
doesn't
know
William
Ayers
very
well
Barack
Obama
is
an
American
citizen
who
was
born
in
the
USA
Oh

and
Barack

mom
was

and

And
as
is

with

comes
wisdom
The

thing
Mr

said
in

video
These
young

are

Too
many
people

look

Mr
The

Cesca
and
his
rugged

Jumpypants
appear
to
be
distracted
by
the
dull
monotony
of
cranking
out
an
actual
living
today
putting
the
food
on
their
families
and
whatnot
so
I
thought
I'd
jump
in
with
today's
Afternoon
Awesome
There's
no
denying
these
videos
can
border
on
the
hagiographic
and
by
now
Republicans
must
be
inventing
new
drinking
games
for
every
Obama
Video
Tearjerker
starring
some
iconic
figure
from
America's
troubled
past
finding
Hope
and
Salvation
in
the
prospect
of
the
Senator's
winning
this
election
And
I
understand
that
Because
it's
Historic
is
not
reason
enough
to
support
a
candidate
for
president
electing
a
particularly
retarded
eggplant
would
make
history
too
but
surely
there
were
more
legitimate
reasons
for
voting
for
George
W
Bush
POW
ZAP
I've
still
got
it
baby
But
this
video
does
what
no
ad
or
stump
speech
or
vapid
smirking
sarcastic
punchline
of
the
McCain
campaign's
has
been
able
to
accomplish
since
Gramps
fell
ass-backwards
into
the
nomination
and
then
played
Spin-the-Bottle
with
his
VP
pick
It
puts
a
human
face
and
real
Hope
on
this
long
march
of
ours
It
makes
it
personal
and
gives
us
all
a
sense
of
pride
and
purpose
in
what
we're
doing
While
their
side
tears
Barack
Obama
down
and
calls
names
and
scrambles
for
any
last
shred
of
humanity
in
the
chum
buckets
of
their
anger
and
vitriol
and
fear
our
side
talks
about
what
this
man
and
his
candidacy
means
to
us
As
people
As
Democrats
As
Americans
Their
side
can
roll
their
eyes
and
mock
these
personal
stories
for
their
treacle
and
their
tears
but
we
know
it's
precisely
these
moments
of
humanity
that
when
taken
in
aggregate
and
amplified
across
this
aching
country
are
the
reason
we're
here
and
the
reason
we'll
win

Yet
The
Chuck
Todd
Unit
on
MSNBC
mentioned
the
Barack
Obama's
not
ready
yet
line
in
the
new
McCain
ad
Todd
thought
that
yet
was
some
sort
of
twisty
esoteric
McCain
message
implying
four
years
of
McCain
and
then
maybe
eight
years
of
Obama
I
don't
think
so
Yet
is
entirely
about
Palin
The
McCain
campaign
hasn't
been
able
to
realistically
make
the
experience
argument
because
of
Palin
being
you
know
ridiculously
out
of
her
depth
They
can't
say
Obama
isn't
ready
without
saying
that
Palin
isn't
ready
So
they
needed

It's
Not
Just
About
Winning
Next
week
at
this
time
we'll
have
a
new
president-elect
And
if
we
pull
this
off
and
our
candidate
wins
this
thing
it
has
got
to
be
by
a
substantial
margin
So
there
are
two
serious
challenges
here
1
win
and
2
win
by
a
lot
One
of
the
far-right's
best
attacks
on
President
Clinton's
leadership
was
his
42-percent
popular
vote
victory
Without
a
governing
mandate
President
Clinton
was
beholden
to
Congress
and
was
unable
to
successfully
pursue
his
agenda
which
eventually
led
to
him
moving
to
the
right
Senator
Obama
absolutely
needs
a
mandate
in
the
mid-50s
in
order
to
govern
yes
and
to
govern
the
way
he
wants
to
That
is
to
keep
the
congressional
Democrats
especially
the
blue
dogs
on-board
and
on-message
with
the
Obama
agenda
rather
than
constantly
leaving
the
reservation
and
to
simply
begin
his
would-be
presidency
with
a
popular
margin
McCain's
campaign
is
mess
and
there's
nothing
more
awesome
than
watching
Republicans
crush
each
other
with
their
stupid
But
if
Senator
Obama
despite
the
economy
despite
his
fundraising
despite
his
historical
campaign
is
only
able
to
win
by
2
or
3
against
the
current
Mr
Magoo
Republican
clown
car
the
Obama
administration
will
be
