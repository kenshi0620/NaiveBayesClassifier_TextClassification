U.N
is
a
Joke
I
don't
even
need
to
say
anything
This
is
self-evidently
ridiculous
For
all
its
faults
the
previous
U.N
commission
occasionally
discussed
and
condemned
the
regimes
most
responsible
for
human
rights
crimes
such
as
those
in
Belarus
and
Burma
China
used
to
feel
compelled
to
burnish
its
record
before
the
annual
meeting
The
new
council
in
contrast
has
so
far
taken
action
on
only
one
country
which
has
dominated
the
debate
at
both
of
its
regular
meetings
and
been
the
sole
subject
of
two
extraordinary
sessions
Israel
This
ludicrous
diplomatic
lynch
mob
has
been
directed
by
the
Organization
of
the
Islamic
Conference
which
accounts
for
17
governments
on
the
47-member
council
and
counts
on
the
support
of
like-minded
dictatorships
such
as
Cuba
and
China
Council
rules
allow
an
extraordinary
session
to
be
called
at
the
behest
of
just
one-third
of
the
membership
making
it
easy
for
the
Islamic
association
to
orchestrate
anti-Israel
spectacles
Several
Muslim
governments
that
boast
of
a
new
commitment
to
democracy
and
human
rights
including
Jordan
and
Morocco
have
readily
joined
in
this
willful
sabotage
of
those
values

Phoenix
is
one
of
many
major
cities
to
receive
an
F
for
its
evacuation
plan
in
case
of
a
disaster
Phoenix
is
among
20
cities
getting
Fs
That
group
includes
New
York
Chicago
Los
Angeles
San
Francisco
San
Diego
and
Las
Vegas
I'm
not
that
concerned
about
my
city
We
don't
really
have
much
of
a
threat
of
natural
disasters
and
I
don't
think
Phoenix
is
very
high
on
the
Al-Qaida
target
list
But
we
still
should
have
a
good
plan
just
in
case
What
really
concerns
me
is
that
L.A
Chicago
and
New
York
also
received
a
failing
grade
New
York
is
the
1
terror
target
and
one
of
the
two
cities
hit
on
9/11
and
they
don't
have
a
good
plan
I
know
that
evacuating
that
many
people
would
be
tough
but
they've
had
five
years
to
come
up
with
a
plan

Suspended
As
you
can
see
I
haven't
posted
in
almost
three
weeks
And
I'm
just
letting
you
know
that
I
probably
won't
be
for
quite
a
while
About
6
weeks
ago
I
was
elected
to
Director
of
Membership
of
the
ASU
College
Republicans
This
has
given
me
many
responsibilities
that
has
taken
up
a
lot
of
time
Also
my
checking
account
has
gotten
a
little
low
so
I
have
been
putting
in
a
lot
more
hours
at
work
And
of
course
I
still
have
classes
to
attend
The
result
of
all
of
this
is
that
I
don't
have
a
lot
of
free
time
Lately
I've
been
going
a
few
days
without
checking
my
e-mail
much
less
having
time
to
blog
So
I
probably
won't
get
back
to
running

site
until
the
end
of

missed
this
The

Bradley

says
that
the

are
over
In

warns
bloggers
and
news
organizations
could
risk
the
wrath
of
the
federal
government
if
they
improperly
link
to
a
campaign's
Web
site
Even
forwarding
a
political
candidate's
press
release
to
a
mailing
list
depending
on
the
details
could
be
punished
by
fines
Smith
should
know
He's
one
of
the

commissioners
at
the

which
is

Vigil
For
Lebanese
Freedom
Last
night
the
executive
board
of
the
College
Republicans
at
ASU
had
a
meeting
outside
the
Memorial
Union
FYI
I'm
the
Director
of
Membership
for
the
club
As
we
were
finishing
up
our
business
a
candle
light
vigil
started
about
50
feet
from
where
we
were
sitting
It
was
a
group
of
50-60
Lebanese/Lebanese-Americans
who
were
calling
for
Lebanon's
freedom
from
Syria
Eight
of
us
went
over
and
joined
in
Not
long
after
we
got
there
one
of
them
asked
us
why
the
Republicans
support
the
Lebanese
We
answered
that
we
believe
in
freedom
and
democracy
and
we
want
the
Lebanese
to
have
those
We
weren't
sure
if
they
were
OK
with
us
being
there
we
didn't
want
to
be
disrespectful
We
soon
found
out
that
they
were
more
than
happy
to
have
us
there
They
handed
us
candles
and
signs
some
of
which
were
in
English
and
some
in
Arabic
They
also
chanted
in
Arabic
luckily
two
of
our
members
are
Palestinian
and
could
translate
for
us
and
in
English
One
man
in
his
20's
asked
to
have
his
picture
taken
with
us
our
club
President
also
took
some
pictures
which
I
will
post
as
soon
as
I
get
them
The
crowd
chanted
things
like
God
Bless
Bush
and
a
few
of
the
kids
there
were
probably
10
children
started
singing
the
Star
Spangled
Banner
which
we
all
joined
in
Some
were
carrying
American
flags
along
with
the
flag
of
Lebanon
All
of
this
I
wish
one
student
I
met
earlier
in
the
day
could
see
He
came
by
our
club's
information
table
and
started
arguing
with
us
about
all
kinds
of
things
Of
course
most
of
the
argument
was
about
Iraq
At
one
point
we
brought
up
the
fact
that
a
shift
towards
democracy
was
happening
in
other
Middle
East
countries
like
Saudi
Arabia
Egypt
and
Lebanon
He
proceeded
to
claim
that
the
war
in
Iraq
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it
a
lot
of
liberals
have
been
saying
this
lately
scroll
up
on
the
link
as
it
takes
you
to
the
bottom
of
the
post
I
wish
he
was
there
later
to
hear
the
Lebanese
chant
God
Bless
Bush
and
then
ask
one
of
them
if
the
war
in
Iraq
had
anything
to
do
with
it
Now
I'm
not
saying
that
Bush
should
get
all
or
even
most
of
the
credit
or
that
the
War
in
Iraq
is
the
main
cause
of
the
current
push
for
democracy
in
Lebanon
I'm
not
saying
those
things
at
all
But
come
on
Liberals
to
say
it
has
nothing
to
with
it
is
to
deny
the
obvious
Can
you
honestly
sit
there
and
tell
me
that
the
movement
in
Lebanon
the
elections
though
small
in
Saudi
Arabia
and
Egypt
announcing
it
will
allow
other
candidates
to
run
against
President
Mubarak
all
happened
less
than
5
weeks
after
the
Iraqi
elections
by
coincidence
Of
course
the
elections
in
Iraq
sent
a
message
to
the
rest
of
the
Arab/Islamic
world
They
have
heard
their
people
ask
Why
not
here
UPDATE
President
Bush
has
given
Syria
a
non-negotiable
deadline
for
pulling
out
of
Lebanon
President
Bush
has
given
Syria
a
non-negotiable
deadline
to
pull
all
of
its
troops
and
agents
out
of
Lebanon
by
May
to
pave
the
way
for
free
parliamentary
elections
The
subject
that
is
most
on
my
mind
right
now
is
getting
Syria
out
of
Lebanon
and
I
don't
mean
just
the
troops
out
of
Lebanon
I
mean
all
of
them
out
of
Lebanon
particularly
the
secret
service
out
of
Lebanon
the
intelligence
services
he
told
members
of
the
New
York
Post
editorial
board
in
an
interview
yesterday
This
is
non-negotiable
It
is
time
to
get
out
I
don't
think
you
can
have
fair
elections
with
Syrian
troops
there

Spread
of
Democracy
The
recent
Lebanese
protests
of
their
Syrian-controlled
government
and
the
subsequent
resignation
of
that
government
have
been
seen
around
the
Middle
East
It
has
caused
people
of
those
countries
to
ask
Why
not
us
What
happened
in
Lebanon
this
week
analysts
say
is
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
in
the
Middle
East
one
in
which
popular
demand
pushes
the
momentum
for
democracy
and
people's
will
can
no
longer
be
disregarded
Television
stations
broadcast
Beirut's
protests
live
into
homes
coffee
shops
and
clubs
across
the
Middle
East
with
the
dramatic
images
of
Lebanese
youths
wearing
red-and-white
scarves
and
waving
the
country's
red
white
and
green
flag
as
they
handed
out
roses
Monday
to
troops
who
had
been
ordered
to
block
them
The
coverage
lasting
all
day
with
hardly
a
break
on
some
stations
culminated
with
the
Syrian-backed
government's
resignation
Inevitably
it
raised
the
question
among
many
spectators
What
about
here
I
wish
this
could
happen
in
Yemen
Ahmed
Murtada
an
unemployed
Yemeni
said
in
San'a
But
here
tanks
would
prevail
Anas
Khashoggi
a
46-year-old
management
consultant
in
the
Saudi
city
of
Jiddah
said
he
followed
Monday's
events
from
beginning
to
end
I
wanted
to
see
how
the
government
reacts
to
the
will
of
the
people
he
said
Was
he
disappointed
Not
at
all
he
said
Hat
tip
Drudge
Also
Syrian
President
al-Assad
said
today
that
the
Syrian
troops
in
Lebanon
would
be
pulled
out
in
a
few
months
I've
said
before
I'll
believe
it
when
I
see
it
But
it's
starting
to
look
more
and
more
like
the
Syrians
don't
have
much
of
an
option
With
the
mass
protests
in
Lebanon
democracies
already
forming
around
them
i.e
Iraq
which
could
lead
to
calls
for
reform
inside
of
Syria
and
the
fact
that
President
Bush
is
going
to
be
around
for
four
more
years
putting
pressure
on
them
there
going
to
have
to
pull
out

Intolerant
Tolerance
Howard
Dean
is
almost

his

matter

Moderate
Republicans
can't

these

conservatives
because

don't
think
tolerance
is
a
virtue
Dean
said
adding
I'm
not
going
to
have
these
right-wingers
throw
away
our
right
to
be
tolerant
And
concluding
his
backyard
speech
with
a
litany
of
Democratic
values
he
added
This
is
a
struggle
of
good
and
evil
And
we're
the
good
He
calls
right-wingers
evil
but
he
