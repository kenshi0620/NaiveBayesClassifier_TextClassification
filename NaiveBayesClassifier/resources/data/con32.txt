Twenty
Years
Ago
12-31-86
At
home
I
had
a
nice
conversation
with
Mom
about
my
career
plans
She
asked
me
what
philosophy
is
I
still
don't
know
all
I
know
is
that
it
has
something
to
do
with
arguing
she
said
I
hated
to
do
it
but
I
told
her
that
as
I
now
understand
philosophy
it
is
not
about
arguing
Rather
it's
about
clarifying
concepts
and
issues
keeping
other
people
such
as
lawyers
doctors
and
scientists
in
line
To
give
an
example
I
told
her
about
property
about
how
it
is
misunderstood
and
why
someone
needs
to
do
the
conceptual
work
This
led
to
a
discussion
of
my
dissertation
and
about
my
likely
effect
on
the
world
I
admitted
that
I
would
spend
my
career
writing
for
other
academics
but
that
eventually
it
might
have
an
effect
on
judges
and
laypeople
I'm
not
out
to
change
the
world
although
that
would
be
a
nice
by-product
I
said
I'm
interested
primarily
in
getting
clear
on
things
so
others
can
make
it
a
better
world

Zune
Does
anybody
have
a
Microsoft
Zune
I'm
thinking
of
buying
one
I
have
a
Rio
Karma
music
player
which
I
like
but
it
holds
only
20
gigabytes
of
music
and
is
almost
full
The
Zune
holds
30
gigabytes
which
will
give
me
plenty
of
room
for
new
CDs
The
weight
is
about
the
same
5.5
ounces
for
the
Karma
5.6
ounces
for
the
Zune
but
the
Zune
is
flatter
6
inches
as
compared
to
1.1
inches
for
the
Karma
and
will
therefore
fit
better
in
my
bicycling
jersey's
pocket
I'm
not
one
to
run
out
for
new
gadgets
just
for
the
sake
of
having
something
new
but
in
this
case
the
Zune
fills
my
needs
better
than
the
Karma
Please
don't
tell
me
to
buy
an
iPod
I
don't
own
anything
by
Apple
and
never
will

From
Today's
New
York
Times
To
the
Editor
You
are
right
The
United
States
needs
a
more
progressive
tax
system
and
the
government
must
find
a
way
to
help
businesses
and
individuals
with
out-of-control
health
care
costs
Readers
might
remember
our
nation's
last
major
ideological
conflict
During
and
after
World
War
II
the
top
income
tax
bracket
was
91
percent
Returning
to
such
a
system
would
accomplish
both
your
objectives
It
would
help
pay
for
health
care
education
and
countless
other
needs
In
addition
it
would
restrain
the
obscenely
high
compensation
of
many
corporate
executives
and
other
believers
in
greed
is
good
and
reduce
the
alarming
gap
between
the
haves
and
the
have-nots

old

The
Ideological
Times
Read
this
Is
anyone
surprised
that
when
the
New
York
Times
makes
a
mistake
in
its
news
coverage
it
is
favorable
to
progressives
and
progressive
causes
and
unfavorable
to
conservatives
and
conservative
causes
If
there
were
no
bias
at
the
Times
mistakes
would
redound
to
the
benefit
of
no
party
no
cause
no
ideology
and
no
political
morality
You
can
complete
the
syllogism

Notice
how
the
meaning
of
the
following
sentences
changes
as
the
word
only
is
moved
1
Only
Professor
Wu
claimed
that
Socrates
wrote
poetry
Meaning
No
one
else
claimed
it
2
Professor
Wu
only
claimed
that
Socrates
wrote
poetry
Meaning
She
didn't
prove
it
she
only
claimed
it
3
Professor
Wu
claimed
only
that
Socrates
wrote
poetry
Meaning
She
claimed
nothing
else
4
Professor
Wu
claimed
that
only
Socrates
wrote
poetry
Meaning
She
claimed
that
no
one
else
wrote
poetry
5
Professor
Wu
claimed
that
Socrates
only
wrote
poetry
Meaning
She
claimed
that
Socrates
didn't
read
poetry
he
only
wrote
it
6
Professor
Wu
claimed
that
Socrates
wrote
only
poetry
Meaning
She
claimed
that
Socrates
wrote
nothing
besides
poetry
The
first
third
fourth
and
fifth
of
these
are
listed
by
Zachary
Seech
in
his
book
Writing
Philosophy
Papers
4th
ed
Belmont
CA
Wadsworth/Thomson
Learning
2004
51
Seech
says
that
the
meaning
of
sentence
5
is
She
claimed
that
Socrates
wrote
nothing
besides
poetry
But
that's
the
meaning
of
sentence
6
not
of
sentence
5
My
list
therefore
is
both
more
complete
and
more
accurate
than
Seech's
By
the
way
Seech's
book
is
very
good
It
is
required
reading
in
my
forthcoming
Seminar
in
Research
Methods
and
Philosophical
Writing

Twenty
Years
Ago
12-30-86
This
evening
I
saw
a
movie
with
Gary
and
Scott
at
the
Quad
Theaters
in
Saginaw
I
drove
Jerry's
Pontiac
J-Car
The
movie
The
Mosquito
Coast
was
excellent
much
better
than
I
expected
It
was
about
an
inventor
played
by
Harrison
Ford
who
gets
fed
up
with
society
and
movies
his
family
a
wife
and
four
small
kids
to
Central
America
There
he
supervises
the
building
of
a
magnificent
estate
in
the
jungle
only
to
lose
it
in
a
fire
that
he
sets
to
kill
three
thugs
All
the
while
he
deteriorates
mentally
putting
his
family
through
the
most
difficult
of
circumstances
The
scenery
is
beautiful
At
the
end
he
is
killed
in
a
freak
accident
and
his
family
lies
to
him
He
asks
as
he
lies
dying
if
sic
should
be
whether
they
are
staying
in
the
jungle
and
they
say
yes
when
in
fact
they
are
heading
for
the
ocean
and
the
United
States
It
was
a
real
study
in
mental
illness
this
movie
and
also
about
the
cohesiveness
of
a
family
Gary
and
Scott
enjoyed
it
I
have
this
movie
in
DVD
format
I
watched
part
of
it
the
other
day
a
television
broadcast
on
my
high-definition
television
Afterward
we
stopped
at
Burger
King
for
a
bite
to
eat
and
went
bowling
at
Stardust
Lanes
Unbeknownst
to
me
some
bowling
alleys
now
have
computerized
scoring
All
we
had
to
do
is
punch
in
our
initials
and
let
the
computer
do
the
rest
When
we
finished
we
asked
the
clerk
to
print
out
our
scores
Neat
huh
I
beat
Gary
and
Scott
in
both
games
but
not
by
much
All
of
our
scores
except
one
were
in
the
low
hundreds
My
best
was
123
my
worst
115
Scott
got
the
most
strikes
I
won
it
seems
on
the
basis
of
my
spares
Numerous
times
I
left
nine
pins
standing
after
the
first
ball
Earlier
while
waiting
for
our
number
to
be
called
we
played
video
games
I
enjoyed
being
around
Gary
and
Scott
It
made
me
feel
young
again
We
dropped
Scott
off
on
the
way
home
and
I
got
to
sleep

1:50

Lying
The
reporter
who
wrote
this
story
would
have
benefited
from
a
course
in
critical
thinking
If
I
tell
you
that
I
have
no
intention
of
leaving
my
job
when
in
fact
I
intend
to
leave
and
if
my
motive
in
misrepresenting
my
intention
is
to
deceive
you
then
I
have
lied
to
you
Whether
the
lie
is
justified
all
things
considered
is
a
separate
question
Perhaps
it
is
perhaps
it
isn't
If
I
tell
you
truthfully
that
I
have
no
intention
of
leaving
my
job
but
change
my
mind
and
leave
I
have
not
lied
to
you
I
have
changed
my
mind
This
is
true
not
just
of
coaches
but
of
anyone
By
the
reporter's
logic
people
who
divorce
are
liars
But
that's
absurd
I
can
be
perfectly
sincere
in
committing
to
you
but
change
my
mind
thereafter
and
sue
for
divorce
It
might
be
wrong
for
me
to
do
this
but
it's
not
wrong
because
it's
a
lie

Intellectual
Dishonesty
John
Deigh
is
a
professor
of
law
at
the
University
of
Texas
at
Austin
I
put
the
word
professor
in
quotation
marks
since
Deigh
has
no
legal
credentials
His
training
is
in
philosophy
Deigh
is
the
editor
of
Ethics
a
prominent
philosophical
periodical
In
the
most
recent
issue
dated
October
2006
he
editorializes
about
the
fallacy
of
deriving
an
is
statement
from
an
ought
statement
not
to
be
confused
with
the
fallacy
known
as
Hume's
Law
of
deriving
an
ought
statement
from
an
is
statement
Deigh
gives
two
illustrations
of
the
fallacy
The
first
concerns
Stalin's
efforts
at
falsifying
the
photographic
record
of
Russia's
October
revolution
and
the
early
history
of
the
Soviet
Union
page
2
The
second
concerns
the
war
in
Iraq
Let
me
reproduce
the
two
paragraphs
about
the
war
in
Iraq
The
Soviet
Union
was
of
course
a
totalitarian
regime
Its
rulers
had
vast
power
over
their
subjects
Nothing
like
this
sort
of
propaganda
campaign
it
is
easy
to
think
is
imaginable
in
modern
liberal
democracies
Yet
the
propaganda
campaign
undertaken
by
President
Bush
and
his
administration
in
the
run
up
to
the
invasion
of
Iraq
and
during
the
subsequent
occupation
of
that
country
should
make
us
think
twice
It
too
was
propelled
by
the
fallacy
of
deriving
is
from
ought
And
it
too
used
false
and
misleading
representations
of
fact
to
gain
support
for
its
architects
ends
Thus
Bush
and
the
leading
members
of
his
administration
loudly
denounced
the
Iraqi
government
as
an
evil
regime
whose
malignancy
not
only
threatened
to
destabilize
the
Middle
East
but
placed
the
Western
world
in
grave
peril
as
well
A
regime
this
wicked
ought
to
be
in
league
with
the
most
diabolical
enemies
of
the
West
plotting
our
destruction
and
it
ought
to
be
amassing
weapons
of
such
destructive
power
as
to
give
it
a
real
chance
of
succeeding
in
these
plots
So
there
followed
from
the
Bush
administration
a
steady
stream
of
alarming
now
discredited
statements
about
the
regime's
ties
to
al-Qaeda
terrorists
its
active
program
for
developing
nuclear
arms
and
its
stockpiling
of
huge
stores
of
chemical
and
biological
weapons
In
the
words
of
the
head
of
British
intelligence
reporting
in
the
secret
Downing
Street
memo
of
July
23
2002
on
the
Bush
administration's
prewar
strategy
the
intelligence
and
facts
were
being
fixed
around
the
policy
One
could
not
give
a
better
description
of
the
fallacy
The
result
has
been
a
major
human
disaster
whether
one
measures
it
by
the
common
conservative
estimate
of
nearly
50,000
civilian
Iraqi
deaths
since
the
invasion
or
by
the
radical
estimate
published
this
month
in
the
Lancet
of
over
600,000
civilian
Iraqi
deaths
or
by
something
in
between
And
while
the
death
toll
in
any
case
is
dwarfed
by
that
of
Stalin's
tyranny
such
comparisons
will
bring
no
comfort
to
the
Iraqi
people
or
to
the
many
families
of
soldiers
who
have
died
in
the
war
or
have
returned
home
horribly
and
permanently
maimed
A
human
disaster
of
this
magnitude
calls
for
investigation
into
its
causes
Has
it
been
due
to
undemocratic
features
of
America's
political
institutions
Was
it
by
exploiting
them
at
an
opportune
time
that
a
determined
clique
of
government
officials
was
able
to
grab
the
levers
of
power
and
push
through
policies
of
unnecessary
war
and
conquest
Or
should
we
conclude
that
the
institutions
of
liberal
democracy
themselves
have
become
less
reliable
safeguards
against
such
efforts
than
we
thought
These
are
questions
for
political
scientists
and
perhaps
eventually
historians
For
philosophers
the
disaster
does
not
appear
to
have
generated
new
questions
for
study
Our
discipline's
research
is
not
as
responsive
to
current
events
But
we
are
not
isolated
from
them
And
one
thing
we
can
do
is
to
acquaint
our
students
with
the
fallacy
of
deriving
is
from
ought
to
alert
them
to
the
ease
with
which
it
is
committed
particularly
in
government
propaganda
pages
2-4
footnotes
omitted
My
first
reaction
upon
reading
Deigh's
editorial
was
that
it's
a
paranoid
rant
that
has
no
place
in
a
serious
philosophical
publication
It
might
be
fit
for
a
blog
or
even
a
newspaper
op-ed
column
but
it's
not
appropriate
for
a
scholarly
organ
My
second
reaction
was
that
my
first
reaction
was
uncharitable
So
let's
put
the
best
spin
on
Deigh's
editorial
even
if
he
doesn't
put
the
best
spin
on
the
Bush
administration's
reasoning
for
he
claims
to
be
making
a
serious
philosophical
point
Did
President
Bush
commit
the
fallacy
of
deriving
an
is
statement
from
an
ought
statement
I
don't
see
it
Deigh
refers
to
a
propaganda
campaign
undertaken
by
the
Bush
administration
But
he
doesn't
support
this
claim
He
says
the
Bush
administration
used
false
and
misleading
representations
of
fact
to
gain
support
for
its
architects
ends
The
implication
is
that
lies
were
told
But
a
lie
is
not
merely
a
false
statement
it
is
a
false
statement
uttered
with
intent
to
deceive
If
Deigh
believes
that
President
Bush
lied
then
given
the
seriousness
of
the
charge
he
has
an
obligation
to
supply
the
false
statement
together
with
evidence
that
at
the
time
it
was
uttered
it
was
known
by
President
Bush
to
be
false
Furthermore
he
must
adduce
evidence
that
President
Bush
uttered
it
with
the
intent
to
deceive
That
one
or
more
of
President
Bush's
factual
claims
was
false
or
turned
out
to
be
false
doesn't
make
it
a
lie
nor
does
it
make
it
propaganda
In
short
Deigh
makes
a
number
of
wild
and
unsupported
assertions
We
teach
our
students
not
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
Indeed
we
grade
their
term
papers
down
when
they
do
Deigh
next
complains
that
President
Bush
described
the
Iraqi
government
of
Saddam
Hussein
as
an
evil
regime
Was
it
not
an
evil
regime
by
any
reasonable
standard
How
many
thousands
of
people
did
Hussein
have
murdered
tortured
raped
and
mutilated
How
many
people
did
he
terrorize
and
for
how
long
Does
Deigh
deny
that
it
was
an
evil
regime
If
it
was
an
evil
regime
what
is
wrong
with
saying
so
and
acting
accordingly
And
keep
in
mind
that
President
Bush
did
not
have
to
speculate
about
Hussein
having
evil
intentions
toward
the
United
States
There
was
plenty
of
evidence
that
he
did
including
Hussein's
own
statements
over
a
period
of
many
years
As
for
President
Bush's
belief
that
Hussein
had
weapons
of
mass
destruction
this
wasn't
something
that
the
president
cooked
up
for
propaganda
purposes
Almost
everyone
in
American
government
including
Bill
Clinton
Al
Gore
and
John
Kerry
believed
it
Deigh
has
to
show
not
that
the
belief
was
false
for
there
can
be
justified
false
beliefs
but
that
it
was
unjustified
or
unreasonable
He
goes
no
way
toward
doing
this
Deigh's
discussion
of
President
Bush's
beliefs
decisions
arguments
and
actions
is
uncharitable
in
the
extreme
to
the
point
where
Deigh's
honesty
must
be
called
into
question
There
is
a
lesson
here
for
students
of
philosophy
but
it's
not
the
one
Deigh
supposes
As
for
the
Iraq
war
being
a
disaster
that
requires
both
elaboration
and
argumentation
Calling
it
a
disaster
several
times
does
not
make
it
a
disaster
Students
take
note
Yes
people
have
died
in
Iraq
since
the
invasion
Lots
of
them
on
both
sides
But
people
die
in
every
war
Does
that
make
every
war
unjustified
How
many
people
died
fighting
Hitler
If
Deigh
believes
that
the
war
in
Iraq
was
unjustified
he
must
make
his
case
He
must
state
his
principle
of
just
war
and
apply
it
to
Iraq
He
doesn't
He
simply
assumes
that
the
war
was
unjustified
and
goes
on
to
explain
why
it
occurred
That's
called
begging
the
question
Students
should
take
note
That
Deigh's
audience
professional
philosophers
overwhelmingly
believes
that
the
war
was
unjustified
is
neither
here
nor
there
Is
he
merely
preaching
to
the
choir
What
would
be
the
point
of
that
He
should
do
what
philosophers
routinely
do
or
profess
to
do
which
is
to
try
to
persuade
those
whose
minds
are
not
already
made
up
But
this
would
require
more
than
the
three
pages
he
devotes
to
the
topic
and
it
would
require
a
lot
less
manipulative
rhetoric
Deigh's
editorial
is
drive-by
philosophy
No
wonder
philosophers
get
no
respect
Deigh
compounds
his
problem
by
trying
to
explain
how
the
disaster
came
about
Doesn't
that
have
the
cart
before
the
horse
First
he
must
establish
that
there
has
been
a
disaster
by
what
standard
then
he
must
explain
in
a
plausible
way
how
it
occurred
so
that
similar
disasters
can
be
prevented
or
averted
Suppose
we
used
Deigh's
technique
on
Deigh's
editorial
Suppose
we
assumed
without
argument
that
Deigh
published
a
scurrilous
poorly
reasoned
editorial
and
then
set
about
to
explain
how
it
could
have
been
published
in
a
journal
as
prestigious
as
Ethics
We
might
say
that
since
Deigh
is
its
editor
nobody
had
the
power
or
the
courage
to
stand
up
to
him
or
to
tell
him
that
his
editorial
is
nothing
more
than
a
paranoid
rant
Or
perhaps
we
would
explain
it
in
terms
of
the
left-wing
bias
of
the
academy
Everyone
to
whom
Deigh
showed
the
editorial
we
might
speculate
shared
his
values
so
he
got
no
disinterested
feedback
Or
maybe
it's
just
a
case
of
Bush
Derangement
Syndrome
And
so
on
I
don't
think
Deigh
would
appreciate
having
his
editorial
dismissed
in
this
way
So
why
does
he
dismiss
the
arguments
of
the
Bush
administration
in
this
way
President
Bush
made
a
multi-pronged
case
for
invading
Iraq
before
he
invaded
Other
people
including
serious
scholars
have
made
a
case
for
war
Deigh
ignores
these
arguments
This
I
assure
you
is
not
in
keeping
with
philosophical
practice
It
is
in
fact
a
disgrace
I've
been
teaching
logic
for
almost
a
quarter
of
a
century
Nothing
in
Deigh's
editorial
convinces
me
that
President
Bush
committed
the
fallacy
of
deriving
an
is
statement
from
an
ought
statement
If
anyone
has
committed
any
fallacies
it
is
Deigh
He's
lucky
he's
not
my
student
If
I
were
grading
his
editorial
it
would
receive
a
D
Addendum

Why
do
we

We

Is
this
just
a

Can

Re

Day

If
our
legislators
won't
act
to
set
limits
on
our
soaring
defense
budget
then
we
as
citizens
must
demand
that
they
do
Knowing
that
our
soldiers
in
Iraq
do
not
get
the
equipment
they
need
and
that
billions
of
dollars
continue
to
pay
for
anachronistic
cold
war
weapons
we
do
not
expect
our
new
Congress
simply
to
knuckle
under
to
the
defense
contractors
as
they
have
in
the
past
Our
representatives
have
to
learn
that
the
citizenry
doesn't
see
it
as
being
soft
on
defense
when
they
restrict
the
enormous
profits
of
the
weapons
industries
cut
unnecessary
weapons
programs
and
ensure
that
the
people
who
actually
fight
our
wars
get
the
protection
they
deserve

Saddam
If
the
Iraqis
had
any
sense
they'd
put
Saddam
Hussein's
hanging
on
pay
per
view
Imagine
the
money
they'd
rake
in
The
money
could
be
used
to
compensate
Hussein's
victims
Addendum
Has
anyone
noticed
the
oddity
of
saying
that
Saddam
Hussein
or
anyone
else
was
executed
To
execute
literally
is
to
follow
or
carry
out
Executives
whether
in
business
or
in
government
are
those
who
are
charged
with
carrying
out
implementing
policies
laws
or
programs
The
executive
virtues
are
those
virtues
such
as
decisiveness
and
leadership
that
are
essential
to
or
that
facilitate
the
carrying
out
of
policies
laws
or
programs
Some
people
have
these
virtues
some
don't
which
is
why
not
everyone
would
make
a
good
executive
I
for
instance
would
not
What
we're
doing
in
capital
punishment
is
executing
i.e
carrying
out
a
sentence
Executing
X
is
therefore
shorthand
for
executing
X's
death
sentence
Perhaps
we
use
execute
because
it's
milder
than
i.e
a
euphemism
for
kill
or
put
to
death
Many
people
are
squeamish
about
killing
even
when
it's
justified
What
we
should
say
is
that
Hussein
was
punished
by
death
That
both
states
the
ground
of
the
killing
namely
punishment
and
describes
the
kind
of
punishment
it
is
namely
capital
Addendum
2
Michelle
Malkin
has
just
the
right
slogan
for
Hussein's
death
Sic
semper
tyrannis
thus
always
to
tyrants
Does
anyone
know
which
assassin
shouted
this
