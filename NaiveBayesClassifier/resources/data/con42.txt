To
deal
with
these
challenges
the
Democrats
present
a
history
making
nominee
for
president
History
making
in
that
he
is
the
most
liberal
most
inexperienced
nominee
to
ever
run
for
President
Apparently
they
believe
that
he
would
match
up
well
with
the
history
making
Democrat
controlled
Congress
History
making
because
it's
the
least
accomplished
and
most
unpopular
Congress
in
our
nation's
history

The
Look
Tells
The
Story
Hello
From
Knoxville
They
say
a
picture
paints
a
thousand
words
The
look
on
the
face
of
House
Speaker
Nancy
Pelosi
tells
the
story
Its
the
story
of
DEFEAT
Had
Pelosi
kept
her
mouth
shut
the
bail
out
for
wall
street
would
have
past
The
blame
lays
no
where
but
with
Pelosi
Her
partisan
tone
caused
this
bill
to
go
down
in
defeat
Representative
Adam
Putnam
of
Florida
the
No
3
House
Republican
said
Pelosi's
speech
cost
us
votes
because
it
set
a
partisan
tone
a
reference
to
her
comment
before
the
vote
blaming
Bush
administration
policies
for
the
crisis
Of
course
her
and
Barney
fife
Frank
blamed
the
Republicans
The
Republicans
killed
this
said
House
Financial
Services
Committee
Chairman
Barney
Frank
a
Massachusetts
Democrat
Least
we
need
reminding
The
Democrats
control
the
house
I
have
said
many
times
Nancy
Pelosi
is
a
failure
She
is
a
failure
as
Speaker
of
the
House
The
Democrats
control
the
house
of
Representative
and
yet
it's
the
Republicans
that
killed
the
bill
The
tally
was
228
to
205
Democrats
voted
140
to
95
in
favor
of
the
legislation
while
just
65
Republicans
backed
the
bill
and
133
opposed
it
So
it's
the
Republicans
that
killed
this
Had
Pelosi
had
the
other
95
in
line
the
bill
would
have
passed
For
the
record
I
am
glad
it
failed
But
its
not
the
Republicans
that
killed
this
it
was
the
other
95
democrats
that
voted
against
it
Again
Pictures
are
worth
a
thousand
words
and
the
look
on
Pelosi's
face
tells
it
all
It
is
a
look
of
Failure
and
defeat
The
inability
to
keep
her
mouth
shut
caused
her
defeat
today
The
democrats
have
been
in
power
for
about
two
years
and
it
has
taken
them
a
very
short
time
to
wreck
the
economy
Nancy
Pelosi
and
the
democrat
leadership
in
congress
are
failures
Have
a
great
Night
Keith

WOW
And
Obama
Thought
Only
He
Could
Draw
A
Crowd
Hello
From
Knoxville
Sarah
Palin
Draws
a
crowd
of
60,000
Amazing
Just
Amazing
I
cannot
remember
when
a
candidate
has
electrified
a
crowd
or
party
the
way
Sarah
Palin
has
Its
just
amazing
I
don't
remember
reading
where
Joe
Biden
has
done
this
Read
below
The
Villages
a
vast
upscale
planned
community
north
of
Orlando
has
about
70,000
mostly
adult
residents
many
of
them
military
retirees
who
vote
reliably
Republican
in
statewide
races
Tens
of
thousands
inched
along
roads
into
the
picturesque
town
square
of
the
complex
where
they
stood
in
sweltering
heat
for
about
four
hours
as
local
GOP
officials
and
a
country
band
revved
up
the
crowd
Sa-Rah
Sa-Rah
they
chanted
at
every
mention
of
her
name
applauding
loudly
and
waiving
tiny
American
flags
that
were
distributed
along
with
free
water
bottles
by
local
volunteers
The
fire
chief
estimated
the
crowd
at
60,000
Admiring
throngs
mobbed
the
Palin
family's
arrival
and
departure
snapping
souvenir
pictures
Autograph
seekers
thrust
campaign
signs
caps
with
the
McCain-Palin
logo
and
copies
of
magazines
with
her
face
on
their
covers
and
the
Palins
responded
warmly
Palin
her
husband
and
three
of
their
children
arrived
in
Orlando
but
spent
a
family
day
at
Disney
World
she
said
as
she
introduced
her
entourage
to
the
enthusiastic
crowd
She
joked
about
similarities
and
differences
of
the
two
states
at
opposite
corners
of
America
but
was
all
business
when
she
focused
on
the
need
for
a
large
voter
turnout
in
a
hotly
contested
state
with
27
electoral
votes
Amazing
Just
amazing
Have
A
Great
Monday

Just
How
Scared
Are
The
Democrats
Hello
From
Knoxville
If
we
thought
that
the
Democrats
were
scared
of
Sarah
Palin
here's
the
proof
According
to
the
Obama
campaign
reported
raising
at
least
10
million
from
more
than
130,000
donors
today
after
Palin
the
Alaska
governor
addressed
the
Republican
National
Convention
in
St
Paul
Minnesota
And
do
you
want
to
know
why
they
are
afraid
of
Gov
Palin
Here
you
go
Gov
Sarah
Palin's
speech
Wednesday
night
at
the
Republican
National
Convention
drew
37
million
viewers
which
is
more
than
those
who
watched
Democratic
vice
president
Joe
Biden
or
potential
first
lady
Michelle
Obama
or
even
Hillary
Clinton
during
the
Democratic
National
Convention
in
Denver
According
to
Nielsen
ratings
Palin's
number
was
just
1.1
million
viewers
shy
of
Democratic
presidential
candidate
Barack
Obama's
record-breaking
speech
at
the
Democratic
meeting
Aug
28
according
to
the
most
recent
Nielsen
Media
Research
ratings
Women
viewers
outnumbered
men
on
Wednesday
night
19.5
million
to
16.4
million
consistent
with
the
pattern
since
last
week
On
day
three
of
the
Democratic
convention
when
Joe
Biden
accepted
the
nomination
for
vice
president
and
Bill
Clinton
stirred
the
audience
at
Pepsi
Center
12
million
adult
women
watched
compared
to
9.7
million
adult
men
During
day
one
of
the
Democratic
convention
Michelle
Obama
garnered
22
million
total
viewers
while
Sen
Hillary
Clinton
got
26
million
viewers
the
next
night
and
on
day
three
Biden
had
24
million
viewers
Palin's
address
is
rated
55
higher
than
Day
3
of
the
DNC
when
her
Democratic
counterpart
Joe
Biden
and
President
Clinton
took
the
stage
Let
me
close
by
saying
they
should
be
scared
Want
more
proof
why
they
are
scared
Ok
here
you
go
Sarah
Palin
electrified
the
Republican
convention
Wednesday
all
the
while
reading
off
a
faulty
teleprompter
and
an
outdated
draft
John
McCain
officials
told
FOX
News
on
Thursday
The
Alaska
governor
overcame
several
glitches
and
technical
problems
to
deliver
her
speech
without
getting
flustered
impressing
McCain
and
his
staff
and
allowing
them
to
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
Foremost
of
the
obstacles
Palin's
teleprompter
was
not
working
properly
When
she
took
the
podium
the
machine
rolled
so
quickly
it
often
skipped
the
first
line
or
two
of
every
paragraph
on
screen
The
operator
said
he
had
new
equipment
and
wasn't
sure
how
it
would
work
However
Palin
also
went
on
stage
with
a
slightly
outdated
hard
copy
of
her
speech
For
various
unexplained
reasons
she
and
her
closest
advisers
had
an
old
draft
on
hand
and
even
had
a
hard
time
furnishing
one
of
those
for
her
to
use
Several
of
the
drafts
were
scribbled
on
so
one
aide
gave
Palin
a
wrinkled
folded
copy
out
of
his
pocket
Officials
said
Palin
responded
in
mom-like
fashion
concluding
Well
I
suppose
I
could
put
a
book
on
it
and
smooth
it
out
a
little
During
one
part
of
her
speech
she
couldn't
see
the
teleprompter
because
signs
were
blocking
it
That
was
when
she
ad-libbed
a
line
about
the
difference
between
a
hockey
mom
and
a
pit
bull
lipstick
The
line
was
a
hit
with
the
audience
It
is
something
she
had
jokingly
said
to
staff
during
the
speech
prep
process
This
woman
is
just
good
Have
a
great
night

From
The
Hills
Of

She

of
Sarah

Sarah
Palin
The
Scared
Media
It's
Football
Time
In
Tennessee
If
you
watched
the
football
game
last
night
you
might
not
think
it's
football
time
in
Tennessee
Oh
well
there's
always
next
week
Now
to
the
topic
of
the
night
Sarah
Palin
and
the
scared
media
It's
no
secret
that
most
in
the
media
are
very
pro
democrat
The
percentage
of
those
in
the
media
voting
democrat
is
very
high
So
it
is
no
wonder
that
they
have
begun
attacking
Sarah
Palin
To
attack
the
candidate
is
one
thing
but
to
attack
their
family
is
another
By
now
you
know
that
Sarah
Palin's
seventeen
year
old
daughter
is
pregnant
You
may
also
have
heard
that
according
to
the
media
her
husband
has
a
2-decade-old
DUI
arrest
The
media
is
running
wild
with
the
story
This
is
all
you're
hearing
on
Fox
and
every
other
news
outlet
First
while
I
do
not
condone
this
kind
of
action
if
everyone
that's
had
sex
before
they
were
married
were
disqualified
from
holding
a
job
there
would
be
very
few
people
working
Lets
be
honest
I
am
a
conservative
Christian
I
believe
marriage
is
sacred
but
I
also
understand
that
people
are
humans
It's
going
to
happen
I
also
remember
in
the
bible
where
God
was
going
to
destroy
the
people
and
then
he
remembered
they
were
but
human
The
children
are
correcting
the
problem
They
plan
on
getting
married
I'm
also
sure
that
if
you
took
all
of
those
committing
adultery
out
of
congress
there
would
be
very
few
people
left
in
Washington
This
is
a
private
family
matter
and
should
be
left
at
that
It's
neither
mine
nor
your
business
This
does
not
disqualify
Sarah
Palin
from
becoming
the
Vice
President
of
the
United
States
Nor
does
having
a
husband
that
has
a
2-decade
old
DUI
arrest
People
make
mistakes
you
learn
and
grow
from
them
and
move
on
Sarah
Palin
has
the
democrat
leaning
media
running
scared
Why
Because
up
until
now
the
base
of
the
Republican
party
has
not
been
excited
about
this
election
Sarah
Palin
has
changed
that
The
democrat
media
was
hoping
this
wouldn't
happen
Much
to
their
dismay
IT
HAS
As
I
said
in
an
earlier
post
I
wasn't
to
excited
about
this
election
but
adding
Sarah
Palin
to
the
ticket
has
gotten
me
fired
up
and
ready
to
work
as
hard
as
I
can
to
get
John
McCain
elected
President
Sarah
Palin
is
going
to
make
an
awesome
Vice
President
To
their
credit
Barack
Obama
and
Joe
Biden
have
both
come
out
against
such
attacks
Barack
Obama
said
that
Palin's
family
and
her
daughter's
pregnancy
were
not
relevant
to
her
potential
performance
as
vice
president
I
think
people's
families
are
off
limits
And
people's
children
are
especially
off
limits
This
shouldn't
be
part
of
our
politics
Biden
taking
questions
Tuesday
afternoon
from
an
audience
at
a
senior
facility
in
Florida
when
ask
about
this
issue
said
The
press
has
been
asking
me
that
question
and
I
have
not
answered
it
for
two
reasons
First
of
all
I
don't
know
the
governor
There
is
no
reason
not
to
respect
her
and
believe
she's
qualified
to
be
the
vice
president
I'm
not
going
to
make
that
judgment
That's
for
you
all
to
make
With
regard
to
the
stuff
that
you're
talking
about
I
have
a
simple
proposition
children
are
off
limits
Children
are
off
limits
We've
all
been
through
things
with
our
children
Just
treat
people
with
common
decency
The
democrat
media
should
heed
the
words
of
Obama
and
Biden
and
BACK
OFF
Sara
Palin
America
Is
Excited
Have
A
Great
Night
Go
Vols
Keith
Tonight
at
the
RNC
Convention
here
is
What
Former
Tennessee
Sen
Fred
Thompson
had
to
say
about
Sarah
Palin
What
a
breath
of
fresh
air
Governor
Sarah
Palin
is
Thompson
said
in
St
Paul
She
is
from
a
small
town
with
small
town
values
but
apparently
that's
not
good
enough
for
those
folks
who
are
attacking
her
and
her
family
Some
Washington
pundits
and
media
big
shots
are
in
a
frenzy
over
the
selection
of
a
woman
who
has
actually
governed
rather
than
just
talked
a
good
game
on
the
Sunday
talk
shows
and
hit
the
Washington
cocktail
circuit
Thompson
said
I
say
give
me
a
tough
Alaskan
Governor
who
has
taken
on
the
political
establishment
in
the
largest
state
in
the
union
and
won
over
the
beltway
business-as-usual
crowd
any
day
of
the
week
It
is
pretty
clear
the
selection
of
Governor
Palin
has
got
the
other
side
and
their
friends
in
the
media
in
a
state
of
panic
She
is
a
courageous
successful
reformer
who
is
not
afraid
to
take
on
the
establishment
Sound
like
anyone
else
we
know

2008
Football
season
Monday
night
At
UCLA
If
you
have
ever
read
any
of
my
post
in
the
past
then
you
know
how
much
I
dislike
Michael
Moore
He
along
with
former
DNC
Chairman
Don
Fowler
have
hit
a
new
low
As
we
all
are
praying
for
the
best
in
New
Orleans
and
along
the
gulf
coast
as
hurricane
Gustav
approaches
Michael
Moore
along
with
Don
Fowler
seem
to
feel
its
funny
to
play
politics
with
peoples
lives
Michael
Moore
along
with
Don
Fowler's
recent
comment
should
be
denounced
by
Barack
Obama
Joe
Biden
an
Howard
Dean
the
present
DNC
Chairman
There
is
no
place
in
politics
for
such
comments
On
Friday
Michael
Moore
told
Keith
Obermann
on
MSNBC
I
was
just
thinking
this
Gustav
is
proof
that
there
is
a
God
in
heaven
To
just
have
it
planned
at
the
same
time
that
it
would
actually
be
on
its
way
to
New
Orleans
for
Day
One
of
the
Republican
convention
up
in
the
Twin
Cities
at
the
top
of
the
Mississippi
River
After
laughing
at
his
words
Moore
tried
to
back
off
of
his
comments
once
he
seen
he
had
put
his
foot
in
his
mouth
I
mean
I
certainly
hope
nobody
gets
hurt
I
hope
everybody's
taking
cover
Then
it
was
reported
that
Don
Fowler
while
on
a
flight
from
Denver
to
Charlotte
after
last
week
Democrat
convention
said
to
Congressman
John
Spratt
of
South
Carolina
So
you
see
it's
funny
That
New
Orleans
will
get
a
hurricane
That's
funny
because
it
is
due
to
hit
when
President
Bush
is
scheduled
to
speak
Isn't
that
cool
This
comment
was
made
after
Fowler
was
over
heard
making
fun
of
Sarah
Palin
calling
her
Dan
Quayle
on
steroids
This
truly
does
show
how
classless
Michael
Moore
and
Don
Fowler
are
According
to
Fowler
hurricane
Gustav
is
proof
that
God
is
on
the
democrats
side
Both
should
apologies
for
their
disturbing
comments
when
peoples
lives
and
the
destruction
of
their
property
are
at
stake
This
is
no
laughing
matter
Happy
Labor
Day

Statement
from
SCGOP
Chairman
Katon
Dawson
The
outrageous
behavior
of
two
of
the
Obama
campaign's
highest
profile
supporters
in
the
south
is
despicable
a
cynical
politization
of
life
and
death
I
call
on
Barack
Obama
to
immediately
denounce
Fowler
and
Spratt
and
demand
sincere
apologies
from
these
members
of
the
Democratic
leadership
Louisiana
Rep
Steve
Scalise
is
calling
on
liberal
filmmaker
Michael
Moore
to
apologize
I
demand
an
immediate
apology
from
Michael
Moore
to
the
people
of
south
Louisiana
for
his
offensive
and
inappropriate
comments
People
in
Louisiana
regardless
of
political
affiliation
are
making
plans
to
leave
to
protect
their
families
from
this
serious
storm
and
the
God
I
know
would
not
share
Michael
Moore's
glee
for
our
plight

Now
I
am
EXCITED
No
I
am
THRILLED
Hello
From
Tennessee
I
will
be
the
first
to
admit
that
I
wasn't
really
happy
or
excited
about
John
McCain
Excited
or
not
I
would
have
voted
for
him
in
November
because
the
only
other
option
is
unacceptable
After
a
week
of
listening
to
the
democrats
with
all
of
their
republican
bashing
I
was
kind
of
looking
forward
to
seeing
who
McCain
would
choose
as
his
running
mate
I
was
thinking
former
Massachusetts
Gov
Mitt
Romney
or
Minnesota
Gov
Tim
Pawlenty
or
maybe
Tom
Ridge
I
really
didn't
think
he
would
pick
Joe
Lieberman
When
I
first
heard
he
had
picked
Gov
Sarah
Palin
of
Alaska
I
was
kind
of
like
hum
not
so
sure
about
this
one
But
the
more
I
heard
the
more
I
begin
to
get
excited
Tonight
I
can
say
I
am
THRILLED
that
John
McCain
has
chosen
Gov
Palin
as
his
running
mate
I
understand
that
we
are
voting
for
a
President
and
not
a
Vice
President
I
also
understand
that
if
the
telephone
rings
at
3am
Senator
John
McCain
will
be
able
to
make
a
quick
decision
unlike
Senator
Barack
Obama
who
will
have
to
call
his
Vice
President
to
get
the
answer
Now
the
democrats
are
questioning
whether
or
not
Palin
is
ready
to
be
President
They
say
she
lacks
the
experience
to
be
President
Barack
Obama
does
The
Obama
campaign
said
Today
John
McCain
put
the
former
mayor
of
a
town
of
9,000
with
zero
foreign
policy
experience
a
heartbeat
away
from
the
presidency
But
what
they
didn't
say
is
she
is
also
Governor
of
the
state
of
Alaska
I
would
say
that
Gov
Palin
has
just
as
much
experience
and
more
to
be
President
as
Barack
Obama
does
What
experience
does
Barack
Obama
have
Hillary
Clinton
put
it
best
he
has
made
a
speech
Today's
announcement
seem
to
have
energized
Senator
McCain
and
the
Republican
party
I
can
honestly
say
that
I
feel
much
better
tonight
about
the
election
than
I
did
last
night
A
self-styled
hockey
mom
and
political
reformer
Palin
has
a
long
history
of
run-ins
with
the
Alaska
GOP
giving
her
genuine
maverick
status
and
reformer
credentials
that
could
complement
McCain's
image
Palin
has
a
record
of
bipartisan
reform
She
has
a
reputation
as
a
maverick
for
bucking
her
party's
establishment
and
Alaska's
powerful
oil
industry
Palin
campaigned
on
ethics
reform
in
the
2006
GOP
primary
to
defeat
incumbent
Gov
Frank
Murkowski
who
served
22
years
in
the
U.S
Senate
before
winning
the
governor's
seat
in
2002
Obama
campaign
also
said
today
Governor
Palin
shares
John
McCain's
commitment
to
overturning
Roe
v
Wade
the
agenda
of
Big
Oil
and
continuing
George
Bush's
failed
economic
policies
That's
not
the
change
we
need
it's
just
more
of
the
same
change
that's
why
Barack
Obama
chose
a
30
year
career
politician
in
Washington
to
be
his
running
mate
Wowwwww
now
that
is
change
I
wonder
if
the
Obama
campaign
is
running
scared
Also
very
interesting
is
the
remake's
that
Senator
Hillary
Clinton
had
regarding
the
chose
We
should
all
be
proud
of
Governor
Sarah
Palin's
historic
nomination
and
I
congratulate
her
and
Senator
McCain
While
their
policies
would
take
America
in
the
wrong
direction
Governor
Palin
will
add
an
important
new
voice
to
the
debate
Palin
mentioned
Clinton
by
name
in
her
acceptance
speech
Friday
saying
Hillary
left
18
million
cracks
in
the
highest
hardest
glass
ceiling
in
America
But
it
turns
out
the
women
of
America
aren't
finished
yet
and
we
can
shatter
that
glass
ceiling
once
and
for
all
As
one
reporter
said
today
Clinton's
statement
reacting
to
Palin
is
markedly
different
than
the
Obama
campaign's
initial
reaction
which
made
no
mention
of
the
historic
nature
of
the
Alaska
Republican's
VP
candidacy
instead
painting
her
as
woefully
inexperienced
to
be
commander-in-chief
The
Obama
campaign
later
released
a
joint
statement
from
both
the
Illinois
senator
and
his
running
mate
Joe
Biden
praising
Palin
for
making
history
I
bet
the
Obama
campaign
is
wondering
tonight
how
they
are
going
to
handle
Gov
Palin
I
think
Joe
Biden
is
about
to
get
a
run
for
his
money
Now
it's
time
to
get
excited
about
the
election
Have
a
great
night
Go

The
Republican
Party
NEEDS
NEW
LEADERSHIP
Hello
From
Tennessee
Summer
has
arrived
in
East
Tennessee
The
weather
is
hot
and
now
beings
a
very
long
5
months
until
the
general
election
in
November
But
before
we
get
there
and
before
we
get
started
on
this
long
road
let
me
kick
off
the
season
by
saying
the
Republican
Party
is
in
desperate
need
of
new
leadership
A
couple
of
weeks
ago
the
GOP
lost
a
seat
in
a
special
election
in
Mississippi
Everyone
started
using
the
word
blood
bath
for
the
GOP
in
November
I
agree
With
the
current
leadership
we
are
heading
for
a
blood
bath
However
there
is
still
time
to
turn
it
around
Instead
of
playing
defense
the
party
needs
to
play
offense
I
have
never
seen
a
more
scared
bunch
of
candy
leg
politicians
than
in
the
GOP
right
now
Everyone
is
running
away
from
the
president
until
it
comes
to
raising
money
for
them
Maybe
the
Republican
Party
needs
to
get
just
a
little
tough
I
believe
it
was
Rep
Davis
from
Virginia
who
made
the
comment
about
the
President
basically
saying
it
was
President
Bush's
fault
that
the
GOP
had
lost
seats
that
were
in
heavily
republican
districts
I
find
that
very
hypocritical
Coming
from
someone
who
is
a
member
of
congress
that
has
approval
ratings
lower
than
the
President
Rep
Davis
and
the
rest
of
the
so
called
GOP
leadership
should
take
a
long
look
in
the
mirror
It
is
true
that
President
Bush
is
very
unpopular
It
is
easy
to
blame
someone
eles
for
failure
than
to
accept
some
of
the
blame
yourself
The
leadership
and
those
running
for
congress
should
return
to
the
values
of
the
Republican
Party
Instead
of
running
scared
the
GOP
needs
to
stand
up
and
get
tough
Return
to
the
policies
of
lower
taxes
illegal
immigration
against
gay
marriage
for
the
family
The
democrats
winning
in
heavily
Republican
districts
are
running
as
conservative
democrats
If
the
GOP
would
to
return
to
our
values
then
they
could
defeat
the
democrats
come
November
We
need
real
leadership
We
deserve
better

The
Face
of
A
Miracle
Hello
From
Tennessee
Tonight
I
was
going
to
write
about
the
election
I
had
planned
on
starting
to
write
again
But
after
the
tornado's
moved
across
parts
of
our
great
state
Tuesday
night
the
story
below
is
a
reminder
that
there
are
more
important
things
in
life
than
politics
So
I
will
save
my
thoughts
on
Tuesdays
election
for
another
night
Please
read
the
story
below
and
keep
the
people
in
your
prayers
The
twisters
killed
32
people
in
Tennessee
13
in
Arkansas
7
in
Kentucky
and
5
in
Alabama
Keith
CASTALIAN
SPRINGS
Tenn
At
first
rescuers
thought
it
was
a
doll
Then
it
moved
In
a
grassy
pasture
strewn
with
toys
splintered
lumber
and
bricks
tossed
by
the
tornado's
widespread
wrath
11-month
old
Kyson
Stowell
was
lying
face
down
in
the
mud
150
yards
from
where
his
home
once
stood
It
looked
like
a
baby
doll
said
David
Harmon
a
firefighter
who
had
already
combed
the
field
once
looking
for
survivors
Then
he
checked
for
a
pulse
He
was
laying
there
motionless
and
he
took
a
breath
of
air
and
started
crying
The
field
had
already
been
combed
once
for
survivors
and
finding
anyone
alive
seemed
improbable
Hours
after
the
storm
there
was
devastation
everywhere
The
body
of
the
boy's
mother
was
found
in
the
same
field
houses
were
wiped
to
concrete
slabs
and
a
brick
post
office
was
blown
to
bits
But
except
for
a
few
scrapes
Kyson
was
fine
Kyson's
story
emerged
as
a
tale
of
hope
amid
spectacular
misery
as
residents
in
Tennessee
Kentucky
Mississippi
Alabama
and
Arkansas
tried
to
piece
their
lives
back
together
after
the
nation's
deadliest
twister
rampage
in
two
decades
killed
58
people
There
was
good
news
to
celebrate
Baby
Kyson
was
discharged
from
a
hospital
and
was
in
the
care
of
his
grandparents
He
had
scrapes
and
gashes
on
his
cheek
and
by
his
big
blue
eyes
but
otherwise
was
fine
Clinging
to
his
grandmother
he
fussed
a
little
something
he
normally
does
at
naptime
As
word
the
tornado
was
coming
spread
through
the
community
Tuesday
the
Stowells
called
their
their
23-year-old
daughter
Kerri
warning
her
to
take
cover
In
a
phone
call
with
her
fiance's
sister
Kerri
said
she
was
bracing
for
the
storm
in
the
bathtub
clutching
her
baby
to
her
side
The
phone
cut
out
as
Kay
Stowell
and
her
daughter
spoke
Then
came
an
ominous
voicemail
no
words
just
the
sound
of
wind
It
took
two
hours
for
the
Stowells
to
drive
around
the
downed
trees
and
power
lines
and
make
the
four-mile
trip
to
Kerri's
home
or
what
was
left
of
it
It
was
during
that
time
that
rescuers
Harmon
and
Karl
Wegner
decided
to
give
the
pasture
one
last
look
When
the
Stowells
made
it
to
the
scene
the
first
thing
Douglas
Stowell
saw
was
a
firefighter
holding
the
baby
Not
long
thereafter
another
emergency
worker
showed
Stowell
a
photo
of
a
body
found
nearby
He
confirmed
it
was
his
stepdaughter
If
it
had
been
both
of
them
I
couldn't
have
handled
it
he
said
Kerri
Stowell's
fiance
22-year-old
Charles
Scott
believed
she
tried
to
keep
her
son
safe
as
the
storm
closed
in
She
would
have
given
her
life
trying
to
protect
that
baby
he
said
The
family
has
set
up
a
trust
fund
to
pay
for
Kyson
Stowell's
college
education
Checks
may
be
sent
to
Sun
Trust
Bank
1605
21st
Ave

Or
call
615-340-0249
Please
Remember
the
People
of
Tennessee
in
your
prayers
Thank
God
that
in
the
mist
of
a
tragedy
there
is
hope
and
there
is
A
miracle

Time
to
write
again
Hello
from
the
hills
of
East
Tennessee
It
hot
dry
and
great
to
be
in
East
Tennessee
Its
been
a
while
since
I
last
updated
the
blog
It's
been
a
really
busy
spring
and
summer
The
kids
are
now
back
in
school
AND
I
AM
SICK
OF
PRESIDENTAL
DEBATES
Man
can't
they
wait
a
little
longer
Every
other
day
the
dem-o-rats
are
debating
with
nothing
new
to
say
Lets
run
raise
taxes
screw
the
people
and
tell
them
it's
what
they
want
But
now
I
have
made
my
choice
on
which
candidate
I
am
supporting
for
president
When
and
If
he
announces
I'm
with
Fred
I
will
make
this
bold
prediction
now
If
Fred
Thompson
runs
he
WILL
carry
his
home
state
of
Tennessee
unlike
the
last
candidate
who
called
Tennessee
home
Al
Gore
Fred
was
a
great
Senator
for
the
state
of
Tennessee
He
would
be
just
as
good
as
president
of
the
United
States
He
is
the
closest
thing
we
have
had
to
the
Great
Ronald
Reagan
in
several
years
So
I'm
with
Fred
It
must
be
sad
to
be
a
dem-o-rat
these
days
Look
at
their
candidate
Sorry
field
But
we
do
have
Fred
now
Things
are
looking
much
better
I
am
posting
a
link
to
his
website
at
the
top
of
my
blog
Now
that
the
presidential
campaign
is
getting
into
full
swing
I
should
be
doing
a
lot
of
posting
I
can
tell
you
now
it
is
going
to
be
fun
The
dem's
must
know
how
bad
they
really
suck
Their
approval
rating
is
below
the
presidents
LOL
Of
course
it
Bush's
fault
that
they
suck
The
first
woman
speaker
of
the
house
what's
her
name
You
know
the
one
that
made
history
Man
I
can't
think
of
her
name
Well
anyway
she
has
really
been
a
failure
This
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
do
nothing
congress
I
have
ever
seen
What
have
they
done
except
complain
and
bitch
about
Iraq
I
have
also
noticed
that
polls
are
turning
in
favor
of
the
President
The
surge
may
be
working
I
know
that
would
really
suck
for
the
democrats
and
the
press
But
being
who
they
are
living
a
miserable
life
I
am
sure
they
will
find
something
to
tare
down
It
must
really
suck
being
a
democrat
I
mean
look
at
them
they
really
are
not
happy
people
The
party
of
gloom
and
dome
They
never
smile
Even
last
November
when
they
won
the
election
they
smiled
for
a
few
moments
then
that
was
it
And
they
don't
really
get
it
I
mean
look
at
the
only
things
that
they
have
done
OOPS
sorry
there
is
nothing
They
don't
seem
to
get
it
that
people
DO
NOT
CARE
about
the
firing
of
8
US
attorneys
The
American
people
DON'T
care
about
it
People
are
not
standing
around
the
water
cooler
saying
oh
my
gosh
they
fired
an
attorney
The
American
people
DON'T
CARE
And
yet
the
dems
can't
seem
to
get
it
Yet
they
seem
to
forget
that
Clinton
fired
a
lot
more
Oh
and
I
forgot
they
bitched
about
the
president's
pardon
of
Scooter
Libby
who
should
have
never
been
convicted
in
the
first
place
He
should
have
NEVER
been
in
a
court
room
to
begin
with
I
mean
let's
face
it
WE
ALL
have
stretched
the
truth
a
little
bit
and
we
all
have
told
little
white
lies
We
are
human
The
money
that
was
WASTED
on
this
circus
should
be
taken
out
of
the
special
prosecutors
pay
For
the
democrats
to
be
bitching
about
his
pardon
is
a
joke
If
every
politician
in
American
was
to
be
tried
and
convicted
on
grounds
of
misleading
then
there
would
be
NO
politicians
in
America
today
Oh
and
I
forgot
the
dems
are
having
all
kinds
of
hearings
Hearings
to
prove
nothing
The
do
nothing
democrats
are
doing
nothing
Have
a
great
Saturday
