The
only
three

in

to

John

the

Washington

have
all
been
given
the

from
Barack

Now
they
will
all
have
to
fly
commercial
in
order
to
get
to
various
events
in
the
last
stretch
of
the

This

one

After
godless

Barack

he

Larry
Eagleburger
Doesn't
Like
Sarah
Palin
Lawrence
Eagleburger
served
as
Secretary
of
State
under
George
H.W
Bush
and
is
a
serious
well-regarded
Republican
statesman
so
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
he
is
secretly
in
the
tank
for
Barack
Obama
Eagleburger
endorsed
John
McCain
for
president
as
McCain
fondly
recalled
in
a
meandering
interview
with
Walter
Cronkite
this
past
weekend
and
yet
This
Eagle
Burger
obviously
harbors
very
sexist
feelings
toward
Sarah
Palin
because
he
had
not-very-supportive
things
to
say

OLD
MEN
SWEARING
Joe
Biden
Had
Salty
Words
For
Press
In
2004
Just
four
short
years
ago
it
was
the
Democrats
who
were
getting
called
out
in
the
press
for
constantly
changing
strategies
and
bickering
publicly
about
petty
nonsense
And
four
years
ago
Joe
Biden
took
a
brave
stand
and
asked
reporters
the
very
important
question
Who
gives
a
shit
Those
are
the
actual
words
out
of
his
mouth
Why
will
he
not
now
take
a
stand
for
his
great
friend
John
McCain
who
is
boldly
running
his
campaign
straight
out
of
the
Kerry
04
playbook

John

Many
