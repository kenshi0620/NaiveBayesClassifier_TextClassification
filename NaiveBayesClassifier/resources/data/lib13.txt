Jim
died
last
night

I'm

Who
do
you
talk
to
about
losing
your
best
friend
when
the
person
you
lost
is
your
best
friend
I
only
hope
he's
right
about
this
heaven
thing
and
that
angels
were
there
to
greet
him
at
the
door
His
friend
Susie
told
me
something
I
didn't
know
about
him
He
loved
The
Sound
of
Music
and
much
to
the
horror
of
the
onlookers
once
sang
the
entire
score
with
her
sitting
outside
Tangier
the
bar
where
they
met
each
week
for
Drinking
Liberally
I
kind
of
like
the
image
of
Jim
singing
and
dancing
until
he's
just
out
of
view
going
somewhere
else
to
sleep
Sweet
dreams
Jim
I
miss
you
so
much
already

OUT
OF
CONTROL
Out
of
Their
Leagues
But
in
Whose
What
is
obviously
most
incredibly
unbelievable
about
the
latest
Bush
administration
scandal
that
surrounding
the
proposed
Saturday
Night
Massacre
of
every
single
U.S
attorney
around
the
country
is
that
the
two
minds
behind
the
effort
the
utterly
incompetent
even
back
in
Austin
Alberto
Gonzales
and
the
quintessential
Avon
Lady
Harriet
Miers
were
considered
by
this
very
White
House
to
be
Supreme
Court
material
Unbelievable
And
yet
well
par
for
the
course
trite
as
that
sounds
are
the
first
words
that
come
to
mind
I
can
hear
the
words
about
Gonzales
already
resigned
in
disgrace
Then
again
I
used
that
same
phase
here
a
few
times
in
reference
to
former
Defense
Secretary
Donald
H
Rumsfeld
and
surprisingly
it
never
caught
on
despite
the
plain
merits
of
the
matter

HAPPY
BIRTHDAY
H.F
Thursday
Bulldog

I
know
you've
seen
this
photograph
here
several
times
but
it's
a
favorite
of
many
readers
and
this
is
a
special
occasion
the
I
don't
know
38th
maybe
birthday
of
my
friend
H.F
Actually
her
birthday
was
March
7
but
she
lives
in
Australia
so
what
with
the
time
change
and
the
International
Date
Line
that
means
it's
really
today
Unless
I'm
mixed
up
and
her
birthday
was
really
the
day
before
yesterday
which
seems
a
bit
more
likely
if
possibly
also
incorrect
Oh
what
the
heck
Either
way

NOW
AND
THEN
The
Importance
of
Being
a
Linguist
Today's
news
President
Bush
instructed
the
nation's
new
spy
chief
to
focus
on
finding
more
recruits
with
the
language
skills
and
cultural
background
to
collect
information
on
al-Qaeda
and
other
terrorist
groups
Yesterday's
news
Nine
Army
linguists
including
six
trained
to
speak
Arabic
have
been
dismissed
from
the
military
because
they
are
gay
The
soldiers
dismissals
come
at
a
time
when
the
military
is
facing
a
critical
shortage
of
translators
and
interpreters
for
the
war
on
terrorism
Will
anything
change
going
forward

MISS
A

Miss

You
spend
a
week
in
that
special
hell
on
earth
known

and
you
miss
so
much
By
the

when
you
hear

how
It's

kept
his
previously

trumpeted
anti-Semitism

John

This
woman
I
continue
for
reasons
unknown
to
call
Anna

though
her
name
is

then
blew
that
credibility
by
hauling
Camille

reading
The

by

and
so
far
it's
quite
good
Sen
Obama
is
obviously
a
very
thoughtful
man
and
he
writes
with
a
great
deal
of
civility
which
no

will
impress
the
punditocracy
I
haven't
encountered
any
revelations
or
much
about
him
I
didn't
already
know
In

the
most
surprising
thing
I've
learned
so
far
is
that
there's

QUOTE
OF
THE
WEEK
Tim
Gunn
Has
His
Priorities
Skewed
This
evening
I
was
listening
to
WHYY-FM
the
generally
excellent
NPR
affiliate
in
Philadelphia
a
station
that
loses
a
few
quality
points
for
playing
far
too
much
jazz
on
weekends
and
for
carrying
Garrison
Keillor's
Prairie
Home
Companion
even
though
another
local
outlet
WRTI-FM
plays
the
same
insipid
program
a
day
earlier
week
after
week
WHYY's
greatest
failing
in
my
opinion
is
paying
good
money
for
the
privilege
I
suppose
they
might
frame
it
that
way
of
broadcasting
Marketplace
a
production
of
American
Public
Media
hosted
by
Kai
Ryssdal
easily
the
most
god-awful
business
program
I've
ever
seen
or
heard
Today
though
Marketplace
offered
some
unintended
lucidity
and
levity
if
that's
the
word
during
reporter
Alisa
Roth's
report
NYC's
Fashion
Week
Looks
for
More
Weight
about
the
rag
trade's
sudden
realization
that
too
many
runway
models
just
might
possibly
be
quite
dangerously
thin
Roth
managed
to
score
some
sound
bites
from
Tim
Gunn
best
known
as
the
surly
patronizing
and
questionably
accomplished
advisor
to
the
contestants
on
Bravo
TV's
Project
Runway
The
transcript
is
not
online
but
the
audio
is
and
if
you
listen
you
will
catch
a
clearly
disturbed
Gunn
offering
this
observation
about
the
fashion
shows
which
I
captured
by
my
own
transcription
I
don't
want
to
sit
and
watch
a
runway
show
and
wince
and
recoil
because
that
model
on
the
runway
looks
like
she
should
be
in
a
hospital
bed
It's
really
unsettling
Hey
Tim's
with
the
program
Or
not
The
Principessa
of
Parsons
then
quickly
offered
this
And
worse
yet
it's
a
distraction
from
the
clothes
You
really
want
to
see
the
clothes
you
don't
want
to
see
the
elbow
and
knee
joints
There
were
no
other
direct
quotes
from
Gunn
but
Roth
tossed
in
a
few
additional
mal
mots
from
the
future
Liz
Claiborne
Inc
officer
Still
he
says
clothes
do
look
more
elegant
on
lithe
figures
than
those
with
bulging
bellies
and
double-wide
backsides
Okay
Tim
So
no
elbow
and
knee
joints
and
no
fatties
So
what
to
do
Roth's
report
then
had
Gunn
babbling
about
the
answer
to
the
problem
having
nothing
to
do
with
broccoli
when
models
typically
subsist
on
cigarettes
and
Champagne
What
Cocaine
is
out
now
but
by
then
I
was
so
disgusted
I
stopped
listening
You're
right
Tim
it's
not
about
the
girls
it's
about
the
clothes
We
can't
have
anything
distracting
from
the
frocks
can
we

The

this

an
unsigned
note
in
the

about
those
liberal
snobs
at
the
New

W]e
predicted
some
months
back
that
Mark
Steyn's
America
Alone
one
of
the
most
important
books
to
be
published
last
year
would
not
be
reviewed
in
the
Times
so
far
its
only
appearance
in
the
Times
has
been
on
its
bestseller
list
Well
Steyn's
pamphlet
may
have
been
on
the
list
at
some
point
but
it's
not
there
now
Regardless
any
idiot
even
one
not

could
have
made
the

prediction
with
perfect
accuracy

that

outfit
that
in

particular

didn't
even
have
the

to
determine
whether
Steyn
who
on
his
web
site
calls
himself
The
One-Man

Content
Provider
an
oblique
yet
still
emetic
reference
I
think
to
his
appreciation
for
the
low-brow
genre
known
as
Broadway

chose
a

matched

I'd
hate
for
you
to
think
that
I
regularly
dress
up
my
bulldog
Mildred
to
say
nothing
of
doing
that
all
the
time
She
wouldn't
stand
for
it
Nor
sit
either
because
that's
really
not
my
style
but
I
thought
we
were
due
for
sharing
another
shot
and
the
only
thing
I
can
find
right
now
is
this
photograph
of
her
wearing
a
pink
hat
and
I
can't
even
remember
the
occasion
A
birthday
maybe
I
know
Her
nose
is
dry
there's
acne
on
her
chin
and
all
in
all
she
doesn't
look
happy
This
is

that
my

is
dry
nor
my

acnefied

I

goes

with

I
know
it's
fashionable
these
days
on
the
right
left
and
center
to
bash
Carter
but
you've
got
to
give
the
man
credit
for
daring
to
raise
issues
that
Americans
with
narrow
even
mainstream-ish
reading
lists
are
unlikely
to
be
exposed
to
He's
hardly
a
radical
and
certainly
no
crank
quite
unlike
the
neocons
who
dominate
the
nation's
discourse
on
the
Israel-Palestine
conflict
and
Martin
Peretz's
paranoia
delusions
and
hyperventilating
notwithstanding
he's
plainly
not
an
anti-Semite
By
the
way
I'm
about
half-way
through
Carter's
new
book
Palestine
Peace
Not
Apartheid
which
is
far
better
and
more
reasonable
than
you
probably
have
been
led
to
expect
I
hope
someone
in
the
State
Department
took
at
least
a
cursory
glance
at
Carter's
article
On
the
subject
of
State
did
anyone
else
think
it
was
a
little
embarrassing
ridiculous
even
that
the
media
was
enthusiastically
promoting
Secretary
of
State
Condoleezza
Rice's
latest
junket
to
the
Middle
East
as
a
fact-finding
tour
I
mean
really
it's
2007
and
she's
just
now
doing
fact-finding
tours
What
does
she
have
a
book
report
due
next
week
Meanwhile
what's
going
on
at
the
State
Department
anyway
Anything
There
are
plenty
of
empty
offices
at
the
assistant
secretary
level
these
days
with
no
clear
indication
of
when
the
seats
might
be
filled
Of
course
sitting
there
these
days
is
tantamount
to
career
suicide
but
that's
another
story

QUOTE
OF

WEEK
On

Broadway
Theaters
Here's
Patti
LuPone's
observation
on
the
growing
prevalence
of
food
and
beverage
concessions
on
Broadway
as
quoted
in
today's
New

Times
Noises
Off
Playgoers
Sip
Munch
and
Crunch
by
Cara
Joy
David
Broadway
is
about
a
theatrical
experience
It's
not
about
pulling
out
Marie
Callender's
chicken
pot
pie
and
a
Sterno
Would
you
go
to
church
and
pull
out
a
ham
sandwich
I
don't
think
so
Then
why
would
you
do
it
at

I
might
add
here
that
I
once
sat
in
a
pew
behind
two
women
who
shared
a
snack
something
noisy
a
granola
bar
perhaps
during
the
homily
of
a
5:15
p.m
weekday
mass
at
Philadelphia's
St
John
the
Evangelist
Church
after
which
anon
and
all
that
believe
it
or
not
both
women
went
up
to
the
altar
and
took
the
Eucharist
which
as
any
halfway
decent
Catholic
knows
is
just
not
done
so
soon
after
eating

for
America

The

at

the

part
published
at
a
significantly
later

by
the

unoriginal
Mark
Steyn
Of

Steyn's
publisher
is
Regnery
the
vanity
publisher
of
the

Canadian
right
wing
so
maybe
it
doesn't
really

MEETING
MAUREEN
FAULKNER
Quite
the
Coincidence
Speaking
of
Daniel
Faulkner
the
Philadelphia
police
office
killed
by
a
since-convicted
cab
driver
25
years
ago
today
and
we
were
just
five
days
ago
tonight
after
work
I
went
to
meet
a
friend
and
while
waiting
who
of
all
people
was
in
the
same
establishment
but
Danny
Faulkner's
widow
Maureen
Faulkner
Mrs
Faulkner
is
I'm
guessing
a
handful
of
years
older
than
I
am
but
she
looks
in
person
considerably
younger
than
she
is
and
she
is
more
attractive
and
full
of
life
considering
what
she
was
put
through
when
she's
standing
a
few
feet
away
than
she
appears
in
most
photographs
not
that
those
snapshots
are
awful
or
anything
We
spoke
for
just
a
minute
or
so
a
conversation
I
would
prefer
to
keep
private
thankfully
I
caught
her
but
five
minutes
before
she
was
headed
out
the
door
Most
people
who
know
me
well
will
say
that
I
am
a
very
quick
and
reliable
judge
of
character
And
so
let
me
offer
this
after
our
brief
exchange
Maureen
Faulkner
is
gracious
warm
and
charming
and
most
grateful
for
the
support
of
those
of
us
who
are
certain
that
the
truth
with
respect
to
Officer
Faulkner's
murder
which
is
still
holding
the
upper
hand
despite
all
the
noise
and
nonsense
and
she
is
thankful
that
we
the
same
people
promise
to
ensure
this
continues
to
be
the
case
in
perpetuity
as
long
as
it
takes

NOT
SO
MUCH
ANYMORE
Jonathan
Saidel
is
Outta
Here
Do
you
remember
that
guy
his
name
was
something
like
Josh
or
Jon
or
Jeremy
or
Julian
and
he's
been
around
here
in
politics
in
Philadelphia
for
like
forever
though
you've
never
been
really
sure
what
his
job
is
or
was
or
what
if
anything
he
ever
really
accomplished
in
it
but
you
heard
he
was
progressive
and
maybe
sort
of
cool
even
though
he
had
some
really
questionable
allies
including
the
type
who
sit
on
their
seats
in
Congress
forever
and
for
no
discernable
reason
and
while
you
knew
he
was
a
Democrat
and
white
and
maybe
he
was
Jewish
but
you
weren't
sure
even
though
that
was
a
little
interesting
given
that
this
is
Philadelphia
and
all
and
then
that
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
he
said
he
was
running
for
mayor
and
he
hired
a
staff
and
opened
an
office
and
everything
to
do
just
that
Well
that
was
Jonathan
Saidel
and
all
that
above
is
just
no
so
much
anymore
thanks
I
think
if
I'm
getting
it
to

Robert
Brady
D
my
very
own
what-has-he-done-for-anyone-lately

who
we're
told
is
going
to
run
for
mayor
adding
to
the
existing
and
expected
crop
of
incredibly
disappointing
prospects
for
that
allegedly
august
office
As
the
race
is
shaping
up
so
far

may

STREET
WALKING
Quite
a
Coincidence
Earlier
today
I
was
walking
around
in
Center
City
and
I
happened
upon
the
block
of
Locust
Street
between
13th
and
12th
heading
east
where
I
saw
yet
again
the
commemorative
plaque
on
the
south
side
of
Locust
the
one
that
always
sends
a
chill
up
and
down
my
spine
It
was
kind
of
a
surprise
then
to
read
in
today's
Philadelphia
Inquirer
not
even
one
hour
later
reporter
Joseph
A
Gambardello's
update
of
the
infamous
1981
murder
that
is
the
reason
the
plaque
is
there
for
all
to
see
and
ponder

Gambardello's
article
begins
Google
Ed
Redacted
the
name
of
a
convicted
murderer
and
you'll
get
more
than
1
million

For
Police
Officer
Daniel
Faulkner
it's
only
22,800
Make
that
22,801
One
more
for
Faulkner's
side
According

Faulker's

Maureen
Faulkner
will
be
in
town
this
week
for
among

things
a
Mass
in

on

though

neglects
to
tell

where
There
will

It
never
ends
for
that
guy
does
it

even
though

helpfully
alerts

to
the

I
know

ALTMOUSE
New
to
the
Blogroll
There's
a
new
addition
to
the
blogroll
Altmouse
which
is
not
the
blog
of
Ann
Althouse
the
intellectually
challenged
and
unbearably
petulant
professor
of
law
toiling
somewhere
in
what
we
Easterners
used
to
call
the
Northwest
Territories
because
they
are
so
so
far
left
away
from
here
Granted
Altmouse
is
generally
until
just
recently
an
even
less
active
blogger
than
I
am
but
what
with
all
the
folderol
this
week
it
just
seems
so
very
apt
and
timely
I
suppose
having
chose
Altmouse
over
Althouse
for
the
blogroll
I've
displayed
unconscionable
partisanship
what
with
all
the
picking
and
choosing
involved
but
I
feel
that
I
have
made
the
right
choice
because
it
is
important
to
make
determinations
based
on
quality
and
quality
is
an
important
characteristic
of
almost
anything
something
that
we
must
look
for
in
persons
places
and
things
Nouns
And
string
String
is
a
noun
And
nouns
are
parts
of
speech
Parts
of
speech
are
to
be
respected
if
for
no
other
reason
that
there
are
so
many
of
them
Nouns
Verbs
Adjectives
There
are
even
things
called
adverbs
This
is
remarkable
And
there
is
no
reason
to
disagree
with
that
Ann
you
see
just
hates
it
when
people
talk
blog
about
her
behind
her
back
in
the
girls
room
blogosphere
and
then
don't
have
the
courtesy
to
link
to
her
site
when
they're
doing
it
Especially
people
like
Andrew
Sullivan
So
detestable
he
I
agree
and
notice
No
link
for
him
And
Ann's
readers
concur
because
Sullivan
is
you
know
teh
gay
Amazingly
Ann
has
the
nerve
to
cite
her
hero
Insta-Linker
Glenn
Rehnolds
in
support
of
her
stance
the
same
Glenn
who
whenever
he
has
written
about
me
has
not
only
not
linked
to
this
blog
but
hasn't
had
the
courtesy
to
spell
my
last
name
correctly
Figures
You
know
there
are
nine
whole
letters
and
four
entire
syllables
in
that
last
name
of
mine
So
complicated
So
difficult
So
foreign
No
wonder
some
people
call
him

Could

A

swing

Leach
based
on
208,483
votes

THE
OTHER
TNR
BLOG
They
Should
Have
Named
It
The
Crank
I'm
still
getting
a
big
kick
out
of
Martin
Peretz's
new
blog
The
Spine
what
with
all
the
gratuitously
snide
and
racist
remarks
directed
against
Arabs
here
is
a
fresh
one
Some
Arabs
are
rich
the
posts
that
reveal
an
astonishing
ignorance
of
the
topic
at
hand
e.g
the
history
of
Catholic
higher
education
in
America
and
the
near
illiteracy
displayed
in
so
many
posts
of
which
this
recent
item
about
Tom
Wolfe
is
an
excellent
example
I
am
one
of
those
who
believes
that
Tom
Wolfe
is
among
the
most
penetrating
and
understandably
literate
social
observers
and
social
commentators
of
the
age
Actually
you
have
to
go
back
to
Thorstein
Veblen
to
read
someone
so
evocative
of
the
realities--sometimes
grim
sometimes
silly--amidst
which
we
live
And
as
for
a
readability
comparison
you
may
have
to
go
back
to
the
English
novelists
of
the
nineteenth
century
It's
not
only
The
Bonfire
of
the
Vanities
which
in
its
day
touched
on
matters
that
were
taboo
is
correct
society
It's
also
his
occasional
journalism
a
journalism
that
does
evoke
someone
else
H.L
Mencken
There's
much
to
wade
through
there
understandably
literate
the
realities
amidst
which
we
live
a
readability
comparison
And
then
my
favorite
sentence
of
all
It's
not
only
The
Bonfire
of
the
Vanities
which
in
its
day
touched
on
matters
that
were
taboo
is
correct
society
Go
ahead
read
that
last
sentence
again
I
gave
it
three
tries
and
came
away
with
nothing
each
time

Good
old

Marty
then
follows
up
with
Carter's
Legacy
in
which
he
begins
You
may
think
that
I
am
obsessed
with
Israel
and
the
Middle
East
and
then
adds
But
have
you
noticed
Jimmy
Carter's
obsession
with
the
same
subjects
He's
not
only
obsessed
but
also
really
doesn't
know
what
he's
talking
about
Forgive
me
I
believe
he
feels
deep
rancor
towards
the
Jews
and
deeper
rancor
towards
Israel
And
those
feelings
give
him
all
the
knowledge
he
thinks
he
needs
Maybe
it
comes
from
his
mother
Or
maybe
it
comes
from
his
brother
But
wherever
it
comes
from
it
is
now
a
part
of
his
life
and
his
legacy
That's
how
he
will
go
down
in
history
as
a
Jew
hater
Speaks
for
itself
I
think
Or
rather
mumbles
along
with
a
certain
paranoid
incoherence

SUNDAY

Veterans
Day
Weekend
Edition
No
Bulge
No
Battle
So
the
father
of
a
couple
of
friends
Knute
they
call
him
is
a
veteran
of
the
Battle
of
the
Bulge
As
far
as
I'm
concerned
that's
about
as
esteemed
and
honorable
as
you
can
get
these

Naturally
then
I
agreed
to
attend
this
afternoon
the
annual
reunion/scholarship-fundraiser
event
of
the
Philadelphia-area
veterans
of
the
battle
held
at
this
place
that's
a
bar
restaurant
and
catering
hall
I
get
there
and
I
find
the
room
and
I
guess
because
there
are
other
events
going
on
the
woman
at
the
table
wants
to
make
sure
I'm
in
the
right
place
As
a
result
the
following
conversation
ensues

Excuse

WOOD
ON
SIEGEL
Inflicting
Justifiable
Pain
Disgraced
former
New
Republic
writer
and
sock-puppet-deploying
blogger
Lee
Siegel's
new
collection
of
essays
Falling
Upwards
Essays
in
Defense
of
the
Imagination
was
reviewed
in
the
New
York
Times
Sunday
Book
Review
section
with
Praise
and
Blame
by
Michael
Wood
professor
of
English
and
comparative
literature
at
Princeton
University
The
essay
is
worth
a
look
After
introducing
the
collection
Wood
writes
Much
of
this
argument
is
too
shallow
to
be
wrong
The
novel
is
collapsing
into
memoir
only
if
you
pay
no
attention
to
what
many
good
novelists
are
doing
and
a
person
who
thinks
best-selling
novels
like
The
Da
Vinci
Code
read
like
actual
histories
needs
to
read
a
little
more
history
The
attractive
opposite
of
the
contemporary
pecking
order
is
not
another
pecking
order
but
a
realm
where
pecking
is
not
the
main
issue
And
if
you
are
seeking
audacity
or
a
resistance
to
convention
perhaps
a
New
York
party
is
not
the
best
place
to
start
even
if
you
could
float
back
into
the
early
days
of
The
Partisan
Review
And
Wood's
review
scarcely
grows
kinder
from
there

a

ENTER
ON
SANSOM
STREET
Nobody
Will
See
You
There
If
you
find
yourself
completely
and
hopelessly
bored
and
alone
on
Tuesday
head
over
to
the
home
of
the
Union
League
of
Philadelphia
140
S
Broad
St
for
a
timely
program
sponsored
by
the
World
Affairs
Council
of
Philadelphia
Red
vs
Blue
Two
Leading
Thinkers
Discuss
a
Divided
America
a
chat
of
some
sort
involving
a
pair
of
Martin
Peretz
proteges
and
that's
not
a
compliment
Peter
Beinart
and
Andrew
Sullivan
a
couple
of
thinkin
guys
who
are
probably
just
as
happy
to
talk
about
anything
other
than
their
gung-ho
support
of
the
war
on
Iraq
The
W.A.C
says
the
program
will
be
moderated
by
Chris
Satullo
whom
the
council
indentifies
as
a
columnist
for
the
Philadelphia
Inquirer
even
though
he
is
the
newspaper's
editorial
page
editor
a
bit
of
a
step
up
even
if
in
that
slot
he
hasn't
yet
banged
out
an
impressive
bestseller
about
a
slobbering
dog
that
any
otherwise
sane
person
would
have
shipped
to
the
pound
round
about
week
three
As
for
the
potential
impact
on
your
wallet
think
nothing
of
it
For
both
the
dinner
and
the
program
the
evening
will
cost
a
mere
65
for
members
N.B
That's
over
and
above
the
sixty
bucks
minimum
you
shelled
out
last
year
to
join
the
frat
and
75
for
non-members
references
being
to
membership
in
W.A.C
I
assume
and
not
the
Union
League
If
you're
just
there
to
gawk
at
Peter
and
Andy
whether
on
a
full
stomach
or
not
it's
20
bucks
or
some
kind
of
pass
for
members
and
25
dollars
for
peon-type
non-members
Sounds
steep
Well
it's
going
to
be
an
evening
jam-packed
with
activities

the
W.A.C

this
imprezzzzzive

Adjournment
I
think
there
might
even
be

for
the

Finally
the
W.A.C
helpfully
advises
business
attire
required
and
warns
please
enter
through
Sansom
Street
which
I
think
is
the
club's
servants
entrance
I'm
sorry
I
won't
see
you
there
I
have
well
I
have
a
thing

Andrew
Cassel
the
economic
columnist
on

Philadelphia
Inquirer's
business
page
isn't
playing
Pollyanna
today
he's
just
really

oddly
apostrophed

where
we

this
A
wise
observer
of
financial
markets
once
observed
that
every
trade
involves
two
views
of
the
future
and
that
one
of
them
is
wrong
Think
about
it
If
I
buy
your
General
Widget
stock
I'm
betting
that
Widget
shares
will
be
worth
more
tomorrow
or
next
month
than
they
are
today
You
by
implication
are
betting
the
opposite
We
can't
both
be
right
This
is
just
silly
entirely
misguided
and
easily
refuted
You
see
I
might
be
very
happy
to
sell

my
shares
of
General
Widget
in
order
to
obtain
the
cash
I
want
to
purchase
shares
of
Consolidated
Doodad
not
because
I
think
the
price
of
General
Widget's
stock
is
going
to
be
worth
less
in
the
future
than
it
is
now
but
because
I
think
my
potential
gain
from
investing
in
Consolidated
Doodad
will
exceed
that
which
I
expect
to
earn
from
the
more
modest
anticipated

to
reverse

irrelevancy
but
New

like
to
know
whether
the
secret

still
harbors
the
religious
biases
that
shaped
and
arguably
have
defined

Allow
me
to
explain
I
received
this
book
in
a
Secret
Santa
exchange
I
thought
it
was
a
gag
gift
as
such
were
allowed
by
the
rules
with
appropriate
compensation
but
I
was
assured
by
the
game's
judge
that
it
was
in
fact
a
genuine
gift
All
the
worse
I
discovered
at
home
that
at
least
a
dozen
pages
were
dog-eared
by
a
previous
reader
Next
year

will
