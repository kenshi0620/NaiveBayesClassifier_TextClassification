It
has
been
a
wild
ride
these
last
5
yrs
and

months
Since

Numerous
Bloggers
have
honored
me
with
inclusion
in
their
Blog
Rolls
The
Blogosphere
has
grown
and
evolved
and
so
have
I
I
gave
birth
to
a
niche
Blog
in
2003
that
has
outstripped
its
parent
in
daily
traffic
and
popularity
and
helped
spur
the
growth
of
that
niche
ever
since
and
will
continue
to
do
so
Change
is
good
So
is
Evolution
I
became
a
Blogger
in
May
2002
and
over
the
years
writing
on
that
Blog
allowed
me
to
share
the
news
and
share
my
opinions
and
my
life
Thru
that
Blog
and
my
BikeBlog
I
re-discovered
a
talent
for
poetry
and
Creative
Writing
and
amateur
journalism
and
I
discovered
the
courage
to
change
my
life
for
the
better
a
journey
that
had
begun
in
1998
and
is
a
work
in
progress
In
the
past
9
months
I've
come
to
accept
that
there
are
far
more
people
with
larger
audiences
more
resources
and
more
time
on
their
hands
to
spread
the
word
and
fight
the
Blog
Fight
with
regards
to
issues
such
as
Illegal
Immigration
The
Muslim
Threat
the
2008
Election
and
the
future
of
America
incumbent
on
its
outcome
than
I
and
that
the
best
thing
for
me
and
my
growth
as
a
person
and
a
writer
was
to
move
on
I
have
been
something
of
a
Creationist
around
here
bringing
to
life
various
personalities
organizations
and
Concepts
in
addition
to
that
other
Blog
So
where
do
I
go
from
here
What
and
where
is
my
place
in
the
Blogosphere
of
today
To
what
few
regular
readers
I've
ever
had
I
can't
thank
you
enough
for
the
support
and
encouragement
and
even
opposing
opinions
you
have
shared
here
over
the
years
To
all
those
who
have
me
in
their
sidebar
I
can't
thank
you
enough
not
just
for
the
support
and
encouragement
you
have
shown
by
such
a
link
but
for
the
approval
of
and
recognition
of
the
quality
writing
and
the
thoughful
intelligence
and
humor
that
I
and
Nikita
too
hopefully
have
put
into
what
appeared
here
that
such
a
link
indicates
I
have
no
way
of
knowing
exactly
how
many
Blogrolls
I'm
on
so
have
no
hope
in
hell
of
lettting
all
of
you
know
that
I'm
moving
on
What
and
where
is
my
place
in
the
Blogosphere
of
today
How
different
from
SEJ
will
it
be
Will
you
know
it
when
you
stumble

Did

Ahmadangerousfanatic
was

a
forum
that
no-one
in
America
would
be
allowed
to
have
in

most
of

he
will
use
what

said

clips

in
reaction
to
some
of

advantage

is

benefits
of

open

he
and
others
in
the
Middle
East
do
not
allow
their
own
people
but
his
is
not
about
those
rights
being
extended
to
him
It
is
the
judgement
of
the
University
in
givng
him
a
forum
that
legitimzes
him
in
the
eyes
of
far
too
many
in
the
world
But
it
is
done
and
the
question
now
is
what
does
the
West
do
next
about
him
about
the
terror
threat
worldwide
and
letting
the
world
know
the
dangers
and
will
Columbia
now
allow
groups
like
The
Minutemen
to
speak
uninterrupted
and
protected
in
the
future
I
do
believe
that
this
Forum
served
a
useful
purpose
in
the
end
by
allowing
more
people
than
usual
to
hear
Ahmgonnaspeakeatcolumbia
express
himself
and
see
how
he
ignores
serious
debate
and
discussion
Just
imagine
how
his
being
denied
to
speak
would
have
been
spun
around
the
world
by
enemies
of
Democracy
and
Freedom
Bolinger's
opening
remarks
to
the
audience
and
especially
to
the
Iranian
Leader
were
strong
and
appropriate

BookCrossing

A
couple
of
my
fellow
BookCrossers
have
said
in
verse
what
BookCrossing
means
to
them
and
what
it
is
all
about
book
crossing
a
head
i
was
surfing
the
web
seeking
books
for
my
daughter
when
to
my
surprise
i
found
in
short
order
a
site
that
was
based
on
this
curious
thought
books
can
freely
be
given
not
merely
be
bought
at
first
blush
the
notion
stood
the
world
on
its
head
i
read
through
the
pages
with
some
sense
of
dread
for
surely
this
concept
would
create
a
schism
between
sharing
ideas
and
capitalism
it's
true
that
i
frequent
the
local
library
so
to
borrow
a
book
is
not
at
all
scary
but
this
seems
quite
different
releasing
a
tome
out
into
the
wild
quite
freely
to
roam
without
payment
or
credit
without
return
date
just
bound
to
the
mysteries
of
fortune
and
fate
with
no
strings
attached
just
a
simple
i.d
so
the
finder
might
tell
of
their
joined
destiny
and
if
they
so
choose
pay
back
kindness
in
kind
freeing
not
just
a
book
but
also
a
mind
twas
then
i
remembered
what
first
brought
me
here
my
searching
out
tales
for
my
daughter
to
hear
in
caring
for
her
i
have
learned
to
my
pleasure
that
life's
greatest
gift
is
a
love
without
measure
and
after
some
thought
i'm
compelled
to
agree
this
realization
should
hold
more
widely
whether
at
random
or
through
planned
exchange
by
chapter
and
verse
the
world
can
be
changed
so
now
into
action
this
thinking
is
led
and
i'm
sure
that
i
see
a
book
crossing
a
head
perhaps
one
fine
morning
i'll
set
out
to
free
em
beside
an
art
gallery
inside
a
museum
at
park
benches
cafes
on
playgrounds
at
schools
at
concerts
and
movies
and
even
bar
stools
to
all
the
book
crossers
those
likewise
inclined
i
hope
in
this
process
much
joy
you
will
find
just
say
to
a
skeptic
if
ever
they
see
ya
you're
simply
embracing
a
novel
idea
let
no
one
dissuade
you
if
this
you
believe
that
truly
tis
better
to
give
than
receive
and
hold
fast
this
adage
both
simple
and
true
do
unto
others
as
you'd
have
done
to
you

One
of
the
great
things
about
living
in
Orange
County
is
that
you
never
know
what
strange
things
you
may
stumble
upon
as
you
travel
around
its
cozy
confines
Last
night
at
915pm
I
approached
the
famous
Block
of
Orange
and
saw
a
sight
straight
out
of
a
Chabad
Telethon
You
know
the
scenes
I'm
talking
about
Normally
sober
serious
and
respectable
adults
many
of
them
older
than
I
am
dancing
joyously
to
a
catchy
tune
Well
um
what
I
witnessed
was
like
that
but
without
the
long
beards
funny
hats
and
great
music
plus
I
was
more
than
twice
the
age
of
just
about
everyone
present
D
As
I
approached
one
of
America's
iconic
dining
establishments
I
saw
what
seemed
like
at
least
100
young
people
singing
clapping
and
dancing
in
and
around
the
drive-thru
entrance
And
eating
donuts
lots
and
lots
of
donuts
They
all
appeared
to
be
caucasian
It
WAS
dark
howeer
and
I
didn't
attempt
a
head
count
so
that's
just
a
guess
too
and
that
just
made
me
more
curious
to
learn
what
had
set
them
off
There
they
were
flushed
with
the
pleasure
of
their
dancing
and
singing
but
what
were
they
singing
was
there
a
meaning
to
their
strange
dance
and
what
planet
did
they
come
from
anyway
After
asking
a
few
questions
of
several
people
who
were
not
caught
up
in
the
frenzy
I
finally
got
some
answers
As
I
watched
the
spectacle
unfolded
before
me
A
bunch
of
the
crowd
did
a
dance
involving
people
moving
forward
and
back
in
the
circle
they
were
in
as
everyone
else
clapped
and
hollered
Then
as
everyone
sang
2
sentences
they
turn
their
backs
to
the
person
next
to
them
or
behind
them
in
the
crowd
and
shake
their
behinds
however
much
they
can
before
turning
around
again
to
the
center
of
the
circle
all
the
while
laughing
and
singing
and
getting
generally
all
excited
Whenever
a
car
would
approach
the
crowd
would
part
and
to
loud
cheers
let
the
devotees
of
Krispy
Kreme
approach
their
shrine
to
worship
I

You

what
The

all
about

what

Okaayyyy
apparently
part
of
what

is
up
to
is
introducing
impressionable

unaccustomed
to
certain
delecacies
they
are
not
familiar
with
where

come

A
perusal
of

revealed
all
The
day
began
with
a
communal
breakfast
and
4
hours
in
Church
Then
came
a
communal
lunch
a
3
hour
event
of
some
sort
followed
by
pizza
washed
down
with
another
2
hours
in
Church
afterward
The
highlight
of
the
day
was
the
evening
nightcap
at
Krispy
Kreme
that
had
begun
at
around
845pm
and
lasted
until
11pm
Check
out
the

for
yourself
it's
all
there
Yes
they
danced
the
whole
time
there
from
what
I
later
learned
when
I
passed
by
after
an
evening
at
the
movies
at
1130pm
Little
did
they
know
that
a
local
Blogger
Yours
Truly
would
happen
upon
the
whole
jouyous
scene
and
snap
a
couple
of
pictures
for
a
story
D
I
watched
for
20
minutes
before
heading
off
to
the
watch
a
movie
People
like
me
coming
to
the
mall
or
leaving
came
by
to
observe
the
spectacle
and
I
got
a
chuckle
out
of
2
young
black
guys
who
shook
their
heads
in
disbelief
at
what
they
were
witnessing

his

shook
his

D
Krispy

no

made
a
killing
D
People

watch
certain

NYPD

Is
this
something
America
should
have
seen
coming
years
ago
I
think
so
Average
citizens
who
quietly
band
together
and
adopt
radical
ways
pose
a
mounting
threat
to
American
security
that
could
exceed
that
of
established
terrorist
groups
like
al-Qaida
a
new
police
analysis
has
concluded
The
New
York
Police
Department
report
released
Wednesday
describes
a
process
in
which
young
men
often
legal
immigrants
from
the
Middle
East
who
are
frustrated
with
their
lives
in
their
adopted
country
adopt
a
philosophy
that
puts
them
on
a
path
to
violence
The
report
was
intended
to
explain
how
people
become
radicalized
rather
than
to
lay
out
specific
strategies
for
thwarting
terror
plots
It
calls
for
more
intelligence
gathering
and
argues
that
local
law
enforcement
agencies
are
in
the
best
position
to
monitor
potential
terrorists

A

with

Bishop

told

Exposing
Peace
Moonbats
in
Santa
Monica
Yesterday
I
went
on
a
nice
long
bike
ride
along
the
coast
and
in
the
Santa
Monica
mountains
Tired
but
happy
I
pedaled
down
the
Bike
Path
along
the
beach
from
Doheny
Beach
to
the
Santa
Monica
Pier
and
upon
my
arrival
encountered
a
spectacle
that
every
Sunday
takes
up
a
good
chunk
of
sand
right
next
to
the
pier
itself
The
minions
of
the
World
Allied
Conspiratorial
Kongress
of
Idiotarians
Everywhere
better
known
as
W.A.C.K.I.E
with
the
complete
support
and
encouragement
of
those
running
the
show
in
the
Socialist
Society
of
Santa
Monica
use
a
public
space
frequented
by
families
with
children
to
spread
propaganda
and
misinformation
about
the
War
Against
Terror
and
Radical
Islam
and
the
ongoing
Liberation
of
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
Admittedly
this
is
a
very
moving
scene
to
witness
and
walk
through
and
at
1st
impression
a
nice
tribute
to
those
who
have
sacrificed
and
died
for
our
country
But
looks
can
be
deceiving
They
describe
their
mission
this
way
We
established
the
Arlington
West
Memorial
at
Santa
Monica
Beach
on
February
15
2004
and
have
maintained
this
weekly
memorial
honoring
those
killed
and
wounded
in
Iraq
with
thousands
of
white
crosses
pictures
of
those
killed
flowers
and
hundreds
of
memorabilia
left
by
family
and
friends
representing
the
loss
of
their
loved
ones
This
memorial
has
been
featured
in
news
stories
around
the
world
As
I
wandered
among
the
displays
of
the
names
of
the
dead
pictures
of
the
dead
and
wounded
about
war
resistance
and
military
service
avoidance
and
about
the
costs
and
blame
these
people
claim
and
the
table
full
of
related
merchandise
for
sale
and
info
for
free
I
overhear
people
espousing
their
misinformation
and
propaganda
in
friendly
earnest
reasonably
sounding
voices
to
the
gullible
and
already
ilinformed
moved
by
what
they
see
around
them
Some
of
the
people
they
talk
to
are
Vets
home
from
the
war
who
agree
with
them
already
for
some
misguided
reason
others
are
people
who
know
or
are
related
to
the
names
on
the
displays
and
are
easily
manipulated
by
their
emotions
Most
however
are
like
me
people
with
no
connection
to
those
fighting
for
their
country
There
is
a
display
where
you
can
Write
any
messsage
you
choose
in
honor
of
the
troops
who
gave
their
lives
and
even
make
a
little
sign
with
your
message
to
take
and
attach
to
one
of
the
crosses
to
join
other
items
of
tribute
some
left
by
family
and
friends
to
the
dead
I
pulled
out
my
pen
and
finding
ample
space
on
a
page
wrote
a
message
that
thanked
our
brave
soldiers
for
their
honorable
service
and
ultimate
sacrifice
in
the
fight
to
liberate
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
and
against
Radical
Islam
a
threat
to
Western
Civilization

none

all

one
would

I'd

D
The

doesn't
even
have

of

because

checked

the
following
We

We

FOR

We
run
to

we
pass

urgent

that
affects
one

the
mothers
and
fathers
the
6,000
human
beings
who
die
every
day
because
they
lack
safe

We
run
because
time
and
water
essential
to
our
existence
is
running
out
for
all
of
us
We
run
to
tell
a

with
suffering

ends
with
hope
We
run
to
include
you
in

You

is

we
will
have
joined
together
to
bring

to
bring
life
to

it

I
can't
go
anywhere
near
a
bookstore

a
Multi-Plex
due
to
the
whole
world
going
Potty
over
Potter
We
believe
that
he
she
um
whoever
revealed
the
facts
is
possibly
jealous
that
so
many

gots
the

for
J
K

not
their
works
said
Chief
Investigator
Jeri
Dalts
of
Huntington
Beach

The
fact
that
this
crime
is
still
unsolved
is
terrible
for
the
cause
of
Literary
Outreach
in
our
city
and
the
world
as
the
Summer
Reading
Season
heats
up
Though
a
clue
was
found
on

of

investigators
remain
clueless
with
no
way
of
identifing
the
perpetrator
I've
seen
book
and
movie
frenzies
like
this
before
said
Mrs
Mugglesworth
Of
course
I've
always
tried
to
just
ignore
it
and
was
always
successful
Until
this
month
According
to
experts
such
tragic
behavior
surrounding
the
publication
of
a
book
occurs
with
disturbing
regularity
It's
an
ancient
risk
that
the
Writers
and
Publishers
have
always
taken
said
Prof
Yor
Leig
Bingpuled
of
the
United
Nations
Office
for
the
Investigation
of
Book
Publishing
Scandals
and
other
Unexplained
Phenomena
The
revelation
has
left
many
of
the
Wizards
fans
young
and
even
younger
very
pissed
off
Our
God
J
K
Rowling
has
been
very
cross
all
week
said
a
local
4th
grader
who
wished
to
remain
un-named
because
she
was
ditching
school
today
to
be
in
line
for
the
midnight
release
of
the
book
on
the
scandal
Especially
at
the
New
York
Times
White
House
Spokesman
Tony
Snow
said
the
President
had
no
comment
Spokespersons
for
Democratic
Leaders
in
Congress
said
they
will
form
a
Committee
Pat
Robertson
on
the
700
Club
said
it
was
God's
Will
Republican
Leaders
are
hoping
Pat
will
just
shut
up
and
believe
that
the
whole
thing
will
just
blow
over
by
Saturday
night
Cindy
Sheehan
plans
to
read
the
whole
Potter
series
from
start
to
finish
over
the
summer
in
the
hopes
that
she
can
glean
some
nugget
that
could
help
her
in
her
possible
campaign
to
run
for
the
office
now
held
by
Nancy
Pelosi
I
know
that
this
reporter
speaks
for
many
Americans
when
I
say
I
have
not
read
the
books
but
thoroughly
LOVE
the
movies
D
I
also
wish
to
say
Kudos
to
Rowling
for
creating
a
series
that
has
helped
kids
discover
the
joys
of
reading
Now
the
big
question
is
not
where
the
next
Big
Thing
in
Young
Adult
Literature
will
come
from
but
whether
those
affected
for
all
these
years
by
this
series
will
expand
their
horizons
and
stick
with
reading
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
Some
say
that
there
are
indications
that
they
have
and
will
I
certainly
hope
so

In

it
behooves
our

to

Is
another
Grocery
Strike
in
the
Bag
Everyone
in
the
county
remembers
the
last
Grocery
Worker
Strike
and
how
much
fun
THAT
was
D
Now
comes
word
that
we
may
be
in
for
a
sequel
Thousands
of
grocery
store
workers
faced
the
possibility
of
a
second
strike
in
just
three
years
as
they
packed
into
union
halls
across
Southern
California
on
Sunday
to
vote
on
a
proposed
contract
The
United
Food
and
Commercial
Workers
which
represents
60,000
workers
forced
a
vote
after
six
months
of
contract
negotiations
that
failed
to
reach
an
agreement
with
Ralphs
Vons
and
Albertsons
Results
of
the
vote
will
be
released
today
and
the
walkout
could
begin
as
soon
as
Friday
At
issue
are
health
benefits
pensions
and
adding
a
lower
payment
scale
for
employees
who
say
they
haven't
had
a
raise
since
2002
A
representative
for
the
grocery
companies
called
the
vote
premature
and
said
store
officials
remain
hopeful
that
they
will
get
back
to
the
bargaining
table
this
week
As
everyone
knows
from
watching
the
antics
of
film
makers
in
Hollyweird
not
all
Sequels
are
equal
Some
should
never
have
been
made
Will
this
if
it
occurs
turn
out
to
be
a
blockbuster
or
a
bust

My
Father
the
Legal
Immigrant
On
Friday
Begin
With
Chapter
1
I
went
to
a
rally
against
the
ACLU
to
represent
my
Father
on
Father's
Day
Weekend
In
this
last
post
in
this
series
I
want
you
to
meet
a
man
who
LEGALLY
immigrated
to
the
United
States
and
is
my
answer
to
all
those
who
have
gotten
and
will
continue
to
get
angry
over
my
views
on
ILLEGAL
ALIENS
Gorge
Kundurdziev
was
born
in
a
small
town
in
the
Macedonian
part
of
Yugoslavia
in
1923
immigrated
to
the
United
States
in
1951/2
had
his
name
involuntarily
Americanized
to
GIorgio
Kundurazieff
in
the
process
married
in
1957
fathered
a
son
and
2
daughters
developed
the
Mental
Illness
known
as
Paranoid
Schizophrenia
a
chronic
mental
illness
in
1969
and
died
in
a
hospital
in
Los
Angeles
in
1988
What
happened
to
him
in
the
end
was
not
easy
to
watch
happen
and
we
could
only
wait
for
the
final
act
knowing
he
was
beyond
communicating
with
us
In
between
he
lived
a
complicated
and
difficult
yet
mostly
happy
life
The
2
photos
here
are
the
oldest
family
photos
our
family
has
of
him
The
bottom
one
is
of
him
and
his
Bulgarian
Army
buddies
early
in
WW2
That's
him
in
the
back
row
on
the
left
The
top
photo
was
taken
at
an
Eastern
Orthodox
Church
in
Glendale
Ca
in
about
1953
Dad
never
talked
much
about
his
life
before
America
The
memories
were
too
painful
I
suppose
Mom
always
said
he
was
in
the
Bulgarian
Airforce
then
in
the
Macedonian
Underground
against
Tito
America's
Commie
of
Choice
in
Europe
at
the
start
of
the
Cold
War
and
that
he
lost
his
left
eye
blowing
up
a
railroad
She
said
that
when
his
unit
was
betrayed
he
fled
the
country
and
spent
a
few
years
in
Refugee
Camps
before
immigrating
to
America
He
never
saw
his
parents
and
sisters
in
person
again
and
they
apparently
spent
some
time
in
Concentration
Camps
because
of
him
When
he
died
in
1988
I
was
able
to
get
his
complete
Immigration
Files
thru
a
Freedom
of
Immigration
Request
What
I
learned
there
was
startling
and
intriguing
While
his
Immigration
was
LEGAL
there
is
a
mystery
in
the
details
that
confuses
the
issue
of
the
life
he
led
during
and
immediately
after
the
war
He
spent
time
in
at
least
2
Refugee
Camps
between
1947
and
1951
and
apparently
made
quite
an
impression
on
some
people
somewhere
because
he
eventually
gained
a
sponsor
for
immigration
to
America
The
sponsor
was
part
of
the
American
Friends
Society
a
Quaker
Relief
Organization
While
Dad
never
made
it
into
High
School
he
was
fluent
in
the
languages
of
his
country
and
even
knew
some
Greek
Italian
and
German
Thus
thru
his
paperwork
I
know
what
day
and
year
and
who
in
what
camp
Americanized
his
name
D
Not
knowing
any
English
he
just
went
with
the
flow
apparently
D
I
know
the
boat
he
came
over
on
and
where
he
went
once
he
got
here
and
why
he
ended
up
in
California
When
you
supposedly
fought
in
the
underground
against
a
country
supported
by
the
people
you
hope
will
take
you
in
I
suppose
being
completely
upfront
with
the
US
Displaced
persons
Commission
about
your
recent
life
wouldn't
be
um
prudent
D
Dad
hated
Communism
and
was
a
proud
Macedonian
Nationalist
and
as
was
shown
in
the
90's
life
in
the
now
broken
up
Yugoslavia
is
all
bound
up
in
matters
of
history
culture
ethnicity
and
religion
All
Dad
knew
was
that
Freedom
and
the
chance
to
rebuild
his
life
lay
in
America
and
death
lay
behind
him
This
1st
page
details
the
story
he
gave
fighting
in
the
Bulgarian
Army
spending
time
in
a
Forced
Labor
Concentration
Camp
in
1945-6
where
he
lost
his
eye
beign
transported
to
a
hospital
then
home
to
recuperate
then
making
for
Greek
and
Italian
Refugee
Camps
in
1947
and
1948
As
the
2nd
page
attached
to
this
document
states
The

Unlike
more
than
12
million
folks
who

5
Signs
of
the
Times
On
Friday
Begin
With
Chapter
1
I
joined
in
the
sign
waving
and
slogan
chanting
with
enthusiasm
and
the
messages
being
sent
by
the
signs
were
intended
not
just
for
the
ACLU
but
for
our
leaders
in
all
levels
of
Government
who
seem
intent
on
ignoring
the
concerns
of
the
average
American
Citizen
with
regards
to
the
issue
of
Illegal
Immigration
and
securing
our
borders
from
intrusion
by
Illegal
Aliens
whether
they
be
workers
criminals
or
terrorists
A
Rainbow
Coalition
Standing
United
came
together
to
Push
our
leaders
in
government
to
stand
up
to
the
ACLU
NOW
and
get
a
Move
On
with
regards
to
seriously
doing
something
about
our
too
Liberal
Open
Borders
north
and
South
and
treatment
of
Illegal
Aliens
As
the
uproar
over
the
current
Illegal
Alien
Amnesty
Bill
shows
the
smell
of
discontent
among
Conservatives
and
other
concerned
citizens
is
in
the
Air
of
America
and
one
would
think
the
people
running
for
offices
from
City
Council
to
President
would
pay
heed
Yesterday
I
found
another
one
of
those
Census
Documents
the
Political
Parties
send
out
that
are
intended
to
make
you
think
you
are
specially
being
singled
out
for
opinion
but
are
really
just
thinly
disguised
pleas
for
money
So
here
I
am
among
a
select
group
of
Republicans
who
have
been
chosen
to
take
part
in
the
official
2007
census
of
the
Republican
Party
Why
is
there
only
1
question
about
Illegal
Immigration
Are
they
serious
Do
they
REALLY
need
to
even
ask
THIS
question
Of
course
I
damn
well
agree
that
WE
MUST
STOP
ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION
The
Party
is
seriously
divided
on
this
issue
and
the
Liberals
are
loving
it
As
the
Police
kept
watch
to
make
sure
we
didn't
get
all
rowdy-like
and
didn't
step
over
or
wave
anything
across
the
barrier
separating
us
from
impeding
the
flow
of
traffic
we
stood
around
chanting
and
waving
slogans
and
waving
the
American
Flag
as
well
