And
you
want
this
animal
to
be
President
Times
of
London
no
US
paper
investigates
the
Messiah
But
a
few
miles
from
where
the
Democratic
presidential
candidate
studied
at
Harvard
his
Kenyan
aunt
and
uncle
immigrants
living
in
modest
circumstances
in
Boston
have
a
contrasting
American
story
Zeituni
Onyango
the
aunt
so
affectionately
described
in
Mr
Obama's
best-selling
memoir
Dreams
from
My
Father
lives
in
a
disabled-access
flat
on
a
rundown
public
housing
estate
in
South
Boston
A
second
relative
believed
to
be
the
long-lost
Uncle
Omar
described
in
the
book
was
beaten
by
armed
robbers
with
a
sawed-off
rifle
while
working
in
a
corner
shop
in
the
Dorchester
area
of
the
city
He
was
later
evicted
from
his
one-bedroom
flat
for
failing
to
pay
2,324.20
arrears
according
to
the
Boston
Housing
Court
Unbelievable
Obama's
touching
tales
of
his
Kenyan
relatives
helped
to
make
him
a
millionaire
and
yet
some
of
those
actual
people
are
now
living
in
squalor
in
Boston
and
he's
never
visited
them
or
loaned
them
a
penny
But
sent
campaign
workers
to
tell
them
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
till
after
the
election
And
there
are
other
stories
like
this
that
have
leaked
out
He
has
brothers
living
in
poverty
in
Kenya--he
doesn't
care
And
he
visited
a
school
there
that
had
been
named
after
him
and
promised
to
help
it--but
never
did
a
thing
This
guy
is
an
obvious
scoundrel
A
fraud
and
a
sham
In
fact
I'm
starting
to
think
he's
a
sociopath
And
brain-dead
Democrats
are
going
to
vote
for
him
and
then
glow
with
smug
self-satisfaction
because
they
are
on
the
side
of
good
and
aren't
like
those
greedy
heartless
Americans

Opposed
to
Western/Judeo-Christian
civilization
From
Orrin
in
a
post
with
the
splendid
title
I
envy
him
this
sort
of
cleverness
Inherit
the
Windbags
about
conservatives
who
support
Obama
In
fact
the
only
real
difference
in
Obama's
policies
compared
to
McCain
is
precisely
that
he's
the
most
extreme
supporter
of
aggressive
social
experimentation
to
be
nominated
for
president
during
this
era
On
matters
of
abortion
infanticide
gay
rights
infant
stem
cells
euthanasia
etc
he
is
consistently
and
radically
Pro-Death
and
opposed
to
Western/Judeo-Christian
civilization
Edmund
Burke
would
have
no
trouble
recognizing
the
Jacobin
in
at
least
this
aspect
of
Mr
Obama's
politics
When
we
consider
then
what
sorts
of
Republicans
are
supporting
Mr
Obama
we
would
as
Mr
Powers
says
expect
to
find
the
old
Eastern
Establishment
secular
Darwinist
Right
Contrary
to
Mr
Powers
these
issues
are
pretty
much
the
same
and
Rockefeller
money
funded
the
more
openly
eugenic
experimentation
of
the
early/mid
20th
Century
That's
not
of
course
to
say
that
every
conservative
backing
Mr
Obama
is
doing
so
because
he'd
increase
abortion
and
fund
it
for
the
poor
but
it
is
fair
to
say
that
they
are
at
least
unbothered
by
the
prospect
In
fact
even
the
ostensibly
pro-life
Doug
Kmiec
was
willing
to
forgo
Communion
in
order
to
back
Barack
Obama
This
is
why
so
many
of
the
converts
cite
the
choice
of
Sarah
Palin
as
a
running
mate
The
choice
drove
home
the
reality
that
the
GOP
is
and
is
going
to
stay
the
party
of
the
religious
They
were
hoping
for
a
Joe
Lieberman
Colin
Powell
Mitt
Romney
or
Tom
Ridge
who
are
indifferent
to
or
supportive
of
abortion
Over
time
this
is
likely
to
be
a
more
permanent
divide
and
is
certain
to
impact
the
Democratic
Party
more
heavily
than
the
Republican
After
all
Darwinism
is
a
marginal
belief
in
America
while
Christianity
is
central
Eventually
one
would
expect
to
see
the
parties
divide
along
more
clearly
secular
vs
religious
lines
and
the
Democratic
hold
on
entire
tribes
loosen
a
process
that
will
be
accelerated
by
the
recognition
that
intellectual
elites
support
the
Democrats
in
no
small
part
because
of
population
control
It
just
fascinates
me
the
people
who
hate
Sarah
It's
so
revealing
The
feminists
who
fantasize
about
seeing
her
raped
or
murdered
for
example
Ladies
your
guilt
is
showing
Or
the
Colin
Powell
and
Christopher
Buckley
types
on
the
right
CONTINUE
READING
Opposed
to
Western/Judeo-Christian
civilization
And
this
is
all
extra
interesting
because
traditionally
the
V-P
is
someone
who
can
give
red
meat
to
the
base
allowing
the
presidential
candidate
to
act
presidential
and
move
to
the
center
This
is
normal
in
our
politics
So
why
should
Republican
centrists
and
libertarians
hate
Sarah
Why
The
real
battle
is
increasingly
about
who
we
are
What
is
America
and
who
are
Americans
This
is
because
old
habits
have
worn
off
Habits
of
religion
yes
but
also
patriotic
faith
and
faith
in
those
things
including
morality
that
ancestors
and
founders
have
handed
down
to
us---faith
that
those
traditions
should
be
revered
And
just---faith
in
America
When
I
was
growing
up
everybody
was
patriotic
I'd
say
that
when
Orrin
writes
the
GOP
is
and
is
going
to
stay
the
party
of
the
religious
we
should
think
of
the
religious
in
a
broad-brush
sort
of
way
It
could
include
those
who
cherish
the
Great
Books
of
Western
Civ
and
those
who
get
a
lump
in
their
throats
when
they
hear
the
Star
Spangled
Banner
at
the
ball
game
That
is
those
who
think
there
are
things
bigger
than
the
almighty
self
things
which
demand
an
attitude
of
humility
and
willingness
to
sacrifice
And
the
irreligious
should
include
many
people
who
still
go
to
church
but
recite
their
creed
in
the
spirit
of
participating
in
a
charming
old
folk-ritual
Or
who
call
themselves
people
of
the
Right
but
recoil
from
moral
responsibility
and
personal
humility
The
battle-lines
are
shifting
and
as
they
do
various
people
are
going
to
find
themselves
suddenly
stranded
in
no-man's-land
wondering
which
way
to
scurry
A
few
decades
ago
we
had
the
neo-cons
Democrats
who
noticed
that
the
Democrat
Party
had
drawn
away
from
them
like
the
tide
going
out...and
awkwardly
found
a
new
home
on
the
right
Perhaps
now
we
will
have
a
bunch
of
neo-libs
I'm
thinking
of
Sager
especially
The
libertarian
creep
of
the
world
I
should
fisk
this
piece
The
Rove
Realignment
Have
libertarians
been
driven
out
of
the
GOP
But
what's
the
use
He'll
never
get
it
Better
he
should
just
head
over
to
the
Party
of
Death
where
he
belongs
Close
it

A
propaganda
arm
of
the
left
going
down
in
flames
Ha

Thanks
to
AOG
A
fascinating
piece
at
Winds
of
Change
by
Tim
Oren
on
the
decline
of
the
newspaper
industry
The
Newspaper
Crash
of
2009
And
How
You
Can
Help
There
are
three
reasons
the
newspaper
industry
is
going
down
Perhaps
more
quickly
than
we
hoped
Besides
the
obvious
reason
that
who
wants
a
pile
of
inky
paper
when
you
can
read
blogs
1
The
subscription-based
economic
model
is
very
attractive
but
only
assuming
that
the
subscriber
base
is
stable
or
growing
If
it
is
shrinking
and
the
cost
of
acquiring
new
subscribers
is
growing
you
still
have
the
expenses
of
putting
out
the
paper
every
day
It's
not
like
a
factory
you
can
close
until
times
get
better
2
The
newspapers
have
heaps
of
debt
Often
including
billions
spent
to
aquire
subscribers
by
buying
other
papers
Now
is
not
a
good
time
to
be
trying
to
refinance
And
3
my
favorite
One
of
the
reasons
that
churn
is
up
for
the
newspapers
is
the
political
bias
I'm
with
Orson
Scott
Card
on
this
The
industry
has
abdicated
its
social
function
to
support
a
well-informed
electorate
and
become
a
propaganda
arm
of
the
left
In
so
doing
they
have
sullied
their
brands
and
lost
the
trust
of
their
readers
The
economic
consequences
of
this
default
of
their
value
proposition
are
now
becoming
apparent
The
Internet
and
an
economic
crisis
together
would
be
bad
enough
but
the
industry
has
only
itself
to
blame
for
the
egregious
behavior
on
display
for
the
last
few
years
and
at
its
worst
right
now
This
is
a
blog
and
I
make
no
vacuous
claims
to
freedom
from
bias
You
can
check
everything
said
above
from
public
records
but
I
do
have
a
dog
in
this
fight
These
people
deserve
to
lose
and
if
the
newspaper
industry
crashes
as
a
byproduct
of
the
economic
crunch
then
it's
a
silver
lining
for
a
dark
cloud
They
have
done
their
level
best
to
trash
the
political
system
of
my
country
and
I
will
dance
on
their
grave
when
they
go
Is
that
clear
enough
Amen

It
is
morally
wrong
to
say
we
have
a
right
to
health
care
Two
reasons
One
which
I
heard
Rush
elucidate
is
that
we
have
a
responsibility
to
maintain
our
own
health
and
we
have
a
moral
obligation
to
help
those
who
can't
help
themselves
Making
health
care
a
right
destroys
both
responsibility
and
obligation
and
damages
us
spiritually
The
other
I
just
noticed
by
Rand
Simberg
Does
Barack
Obama
agree
with
Marcy
Kaptur
that
we
need
a
Second
Bill
of
Rights
Sure
he
does
He
already
said
in
a
debate
that
we
all
have
a
right
to
health
care
No
I
don't
think
that
I
or
anyone
has
a
right
to
stuff
that
requires
taking
from
others
This
is
Eurosocialism
Of
course
I've
always
been
in
agreement
with
those
points
but
I
hadn't
ever
expressed
them
clearly

We
are
all
so
GOOD
Ron
comments
on
the
previous
post
You
know
I've
been
thinking
about
this
Obama
phenomenon
for
some
time
and
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
Where
did
he
come
from
and
how
in
the
world
did
he
get
such
a
following
in
such
a
short
period
of
time
It's
downright
spooky
Could
someone
out
there
explain
this
all
to
me
You
came
to
the
right
place
Ron
Random
Jottings
knows
all
tells
all
I
think
this
post
with
its
quote
by
Shannon
Love
gets
closest
to
explaining
A
bit
of
the
quote
I
think
that
politics
on
the
Left
has
become
a
social
process
i.e
a
means
of
group
identification
and
self-validation
Leftists
care
less
about
the
triumph
of
ideas
and
far
more
about
the
triumph
of
a
group
of
people
with
which
they
ego-identify
They
need
their
ego-identity
candidate
to
win
so
that
they
can
feel
good
about
themselves
The
character
and
policies
of
the
actual
candidate
does
not
matter
When
I
was
a
wee
lad
if
a
person
wanted
to
be
a
non-conformist
they
became
a
Beatnik
or
joined
some
similar
artsy
subculture
That
is
they
conformed
to
the
ways
of
a
group
that
was
non-conformist
The
idiocy
of
this
sort
of
thing
rarely
seems
to
be
noticed
then
or
now
I
remember
it
well
People
daringly
drank
French
wine
and
Italian
coffee
and
ate
Moussaka
And
looked
down
on
the
conformist
rabble
It's
similar
now
If
you
want
to
be
good
you
can't
just
like
you
know
be
good
No
way
You
have
to
join
a
group
that
is
perceived
to
be
good
In
popular
imagination
today
that
means
liberal
Democrat
The
fact
that
they
are
actually
evil
is
of
no
consequence
And
then
whenever
the
Democrat
candidate
wins
you
get
a
sort
of
validation
As
if
the
world
is
giving
you
an
accolade
for
being
good
Confirming
your
superiorty
as
it
were
Now
if
the
Dem
candidate
is
the
usual
white
middle-aged
career
pol
this
validation
is
sort
of
muted
It
lacks
pizazz
But
if
the
candidate
is
cool
and
handsome
and
youngish
and
well-dressed
all
qualities
one
would
like
to
have
rub
off
on
oneself)---wow
the
payoff
is
bigger
by
an
order
of
magnitude
AND
if
the
ego-identity
candidate
is.....brace
yourself
for
a
thrill
running
down
your
leg....if
he
is.....yes......African-American....a
magic
negro....the
coolest
thing....the
ego-validation
is
just
stratospheric
The
Dems
could
probably
run
a
cardboard
cut-out
of
Mr
Obama
and
have
a
good
chance
of
winning
Update
As
a
historical
note
I
remember
reading
somewhere
about
bohemian
non-conformist
types
in
New
York
around
maybe
1910
They
would
head
down
to
The
Village
which
was
then
Italian
and
be
really
artsy
and
different
by
eating......Spaghetti
I
laugh
every
time
I
think
of
that

That's

A

Now
Susie
you
know
that
27
of
those
points
will
have
to
be
given
to
those
who
are
less
fortunate
than
you
Other

don't

you
have
Your

will
be

But
but.....I
worked
HARD
And
those
other
kids
just
goofed
off
Teacher
Remember
how
I
told
the
class
how
Leader
Obama
has
taught
us
about
redistributive
change
You
are
supposed
to
be
happy
to
help
the
poor
and
those
harmed
by
white
racism
Clip
of
Obama
speaking
the
political
and
community
organizing
and
activities
on
the
ground
that
are
able
to
put
together
the
actual
coalitions
of
power
through
which
to
bring
about
redistributive
change
Father
But
what
about
our
Constitution
Teacher
Leader
Obama
wishes
to
preserve
our
sacred
Constitution
from
desecration
and
change
That's
why
he
has
had
it
revised
and
brought
up
to
date
Clip
of
Obama
speaking
The
Warren
Court
it
wasn't
that
radical
It
didn't
break
free
from
the
essential
constraints
that
were
placed
by
the
Founding
Fathers
in
the
Constitution
Teacher
Susie
your
mind
is
still
filled
with
white
ideas
about
personal
property
Next
week
we
will
begin
studying
Education
Leader
Ayers
new
book
Social
Justice
for
the
New
Millenium
and
you
will
start
to
understand
about
giving
to
people
in
accordance
with
their
needs

Defending
the
culture
IS
a
governing
philosophy
Orrin
Judd
Not
that
the
GOP
doesn't
need
some
re-focusing
but
what
the
Beltway
types
can
never
seem
to
grasp
is
that
defending
the
culture
is
a
governing
philosophy
indeed
the
philosophy
of
the
majority
And
what
the
Left
wants
to
do
is
destroy
the
culture
in
order
to
make
people
dependent
on
the
State
Exactly
And
Sarah
embodies
this
philosophy
That
is
she
doesn't
expound
it
she's
just
the
thing
itself
And
Palinmania
is
a
very
rational
response
to
her
A
matter
of
having
something
just
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
for
years
and
seeing
Sarah
and
saying
That's
IT
That's
what
I've
been
trying
to
say
and
never
could
quite
find
the
words
Of
course
you
want
to
jump
up
and
down
and
cheer
It's
frustrating
because
the
attacks
on
America's
traditional
culture
are
mostly
in
the
form
of
millions
of
tiny
cuts
by
millions
of
tiny
shit-stupid
ant
workers
Few
of
which
are
big
enough
to
make
a
fuss
about
And
if
you
were
to
do
so
you
would
at
most
push
them
back
a
few
feet
but
then
see
them
ooze
around
you
once
again
I
was
just
thinking
about
the
way
when
you
or
someone
you
know
is
in
the
hospital
you
get
a
visit
from
a
social
worker
whether
you
want
it
or
not
On
one
hand
is
a
trivial
thing
and
lots
of
people
may
benefit
from
it
On
the
other
hand
it's
a
clear
message
that
you
are
expected
to
rely
on
the
bureaucracy
not
on
the
support
of
family
or
church
or
such
old-fashioned
things
It's
something
that
to
me
has
a
nasty
smell
but
if
you
complained
you
would
just
be
thought
to
be
a
crank
I
don't
know
if
anything
can
really
be
done
My
guess
is
we
are
doomed
But
I
do
know
that
the
National
Review
types
don't
quite
get
it
and
Sarah
does
quite
get
it
So
she's
my
gal
and
I'm
sure
a
lot
of
other
grass-roots
Republicans
feel
the
same
And
even
if
the
struggle
is
hopeless
one
should
keep
fighting
anyway
One
is
either
a
man
or
a
horrid
vile
cowardly
collectivist
flubber-worm
I've
added
a
quote
to
the
top
of
the
sidebar
to
express
my
deep
and
bitter
feeling
on
this
Explanation
here
Well
it's
plenty
late
I
should
be
in
bed
But
I'll
post
this
pour
another
glass
of
Scotch
think
of
Scotland
and
Western
Civilization
on
the
skids
And
I'll
say
yet
another
prayer
to
Our
Lady
to
give
Sarah
strength
and
protect
her
from
the
hosts
of
Mordor
And
resolve
to
go
down
fighting

A
good
man
passes
One
of
my
favorite
bloggers
and
writers
Dean
Barnett
died
today
I've
quoted
him
here
many
times
I
feel
like
I've
lost
a
friend
though
I
never
met
him
You
might
want
to
read
these
tributes
by
Hugh
Hewitt
and
Dafydd
REVERSES
WHEN
mirth
is
full
and
free
Some
sudden
gloom
shall
be
When
haughty
power
mounts
high
The
Watcher's
axe
is
nigh
All
growth
has
bound
when
greatest
found
It
hastes
to
die
When
the
rich
town
that
long
Has
lain
its
huts
among
Uprears
its
pageants
vast
And
vaunts
it
shall
not
last
Bright
tints
that
shine
are
but
a
sign
Of
summer
past
And
when
thine
eye
surveys
With
fond
adoring
gaze
And
yearning
heart
thy
friend
Love
to
its
grave
doth
tend
All
gifts
below
save
Truth
but
grow
Towards

redistributive
change
Barack
Obama
just
a
few
years
ago
But
the
Supreme
Court
never
ventured
into
the
issues
of
redistribution
of
wealth
and
more
basic
issues
of
political
and
economic
justice
in
this
society
And
to
that
extent
as
radical
as
I
think
people
try
to
characterize
the
Warren
Court
it
wasn't
that
radical
It
didn't
break
free
from
the
essential
constraints
that
were
placed
by
the
Founding
Fathers
in
the
Constitution
at
least
as
it's
been
interpreted
and
the
Warren
Court
interpreted
it
in
the
same
way
that
generally
the
Constitution
is
a
charter
of
negative
liberties
And
one
of
the
I
think
tragedies
of
the
civil
rights
movement
was
because
the
civil
rights
movement
became
so
court-focused
I
think
there
was
a
tendency
to
lose
track
of
the
political
and
community
organizing
and
activities
on
the
ground
that
are
able
to
put
together
the
actual
coalitions
of
power
through
which
to
bring
about
redistributive
change
He's
a
Commie
who
wants
to
destroy
our
country
and
way
of
life
It's
that
simple
Hey
my
Lefty
readers
Obama
says
the
Warren
Court
didn't
break
free
from
the
essential
constraints
that
were
placed
by
the
Founding
Fathers
in
the
Constitution
in
favor
of
redistribution
of
wealth
That's
obviously
what
Obama
wants
Are
you
OK
with
this
or
not
Yes
or
no
Show
some
guts
and
honesty
for
once
scrubs
and
take
a
clear
stand

Be
thoughtful--listen
to
Oprah
Bookworm
writes
I
was
sitting
near
two
women
and
overheard
part
of
their
conversation
After
a
lengthy
back
and
forth
praising
Oprah
this
gem
came
out
Sarah
Palin
is
stupid
but
she
communicates
really
well
to
Americans
because
most
Americans
are
stupid
I
live
among
this
sort
of
people
that's
exactly
how
they
think
In
fact
a
lot
of
them
including
I'm
sure
these
two---this
is
Marin
County
are
Democrats
because
the
Dem
Party
is
somehow
in
the
popular
mind
associated
with
intelligence
They
would
never
dream
of
showing
intelligence
by
actually
thinking
Instead
they
will
buy
some
books
Oprah
recommends
and
put
them
on
the
coffee
table
to
show
that
they
are
thoughtful
My
experience
in
seven
years
of
blogging
is
that
Democrats
are
in
fact
really
stupid
Not
one
of
them
has
been
able
to
make
a
case
for
their
vague
slippery
ideas
And
notice
that
while
the
two
women
do
not
precisely
say
that
they
themselves
are
not
Americans
they
imply
it
I
hear
that
kind
of
thing
here
often
Americans
treated
in
a
vague
way
as
some
sort
of
foreign
species
You
won't
ever
be
able
pin
them
down
but
the
implication
is
always
there
But
if
there
were
an
invasion
of
terrorists
you
can
bet
the
sneering
metrosexuals
and
anti-war
types
would
be
howling
for
Americans
to
come
with
guns
and
bombs
to
save
them

Almost
the
opposite
of
abstraction
From
Saint
Thomas
Aquinas
by
GK
Chesterton
First
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
Greek
influence
continued
to
flow
from
the
Greek
Empire
or
at
least
from
the
centre
of
the
Roman
Empire
which
was
in
the
Greek
city
of
Byzantium
and
no
longer
in
Rome
That
influence
was
Byzantine
in
every
good
and
bad
sense
like
Byzantine
art
it
was
severe
and
mathematical
and
a
little
terrible
like
Byzantine
etiquette
it
was
Oriental
and
faintly
decadent
We
owe
to
the
learning
of
Mr
Christopher
Dawson
much
enlightenment
upon
the
way
in
which
Byzantium
slowly
stiffened
into
a
sort
of
Asiatic
theocracy
more
like
that
which
served
the
Sacred
Emperor
in
China
But
even
the
unlearned
can
see
the
difference
in
the
way
in
which
Eastern
Christianity
flattened
everything
as
it
flattened
the
faces
of
the
images
into
icons
It
became
a
thing
of
patterns
rather
than
pictures
and
it
made
definite
and
destructive
war
upon
statues
Thus
we
see
strangely
enough
that
the
East
was
the
land
of
the
Cross
and
the
West
was
the
land
of
the
Crucifix
The
Greeks
were
being
dehumanised
by
a
radiant
symbol
while
the
Goths
were
being
humanised
by
an
instrument
of
torture
Only
the
West
made
realistic
pictures
of
the
greatest
of
all
the
tales
out
of
the
East
Hence
the
Greek
element
in
Christian
theology
tended
more
and
more
to
be
a
sort
of
dried
up
Platonism
a
thing
of
diagrams
and
abstractions
to
the
last
indeed
noble
abstractions
but
not
sufficiently
touched
by
that
great
thing
that
is
by
definition
almost
the
opposite
of
abstraction
Incarnation
Their
Logos
was
the
Word
but
not
the
Word
made
Flesh
In
a
thousand
very
subtle
ways
often
escaping
doctrinal
definition
this
spirit
spread
over
the
world
of
Christendom
from
the
place
where
the
Sacred
Emperor
sat
under
his
golden
mosaics
and
the
flat
pavement
of
the
Roman
Empire
was
at
last
a
sort
of
smooth
pathway
for
Mahomet
For
Islam
was
the
ultimate
fulfilment
of
the
Iconoclasts
Chesterton's
book
is
very
worth
reading
by
the
way
If
you
want
an
introduction
to
Aquinas
you
simply
cannot
do
better
as
many
Aquinas
scholars
have
agreed
It
is
highly
readable
and
thought-provoking

This
is
not
a
parody
I
guess
Charlene
notes
a
letter
sent
to
Jerry
Pournelle
Orchestrated
Objective
Reality
Orch
OR
is
a
theory
of
consciousness
jointly
developed
from
independent
underpinnings
by
Sir
Roger
Penrose
and
anesthesiologist/neurologist
Sturart
Hameroff
To
summarize
the
core
theory
states
that
consciousness
arises
from
quantum
mechanical
effects
in
the
transmission
and
operation
of
nervous
tissue
probably
in
connection
with
quantum
coherence
in
spin
states
of
solvated
electrons
trapped
within
microtubules
embedded
in
the
connective
proteins
of
nerve
cells
which
they
argue
following
Penrose
allows
collapses
of
formative
quantum
events
into
a
final
objective
quantum
state
associated
with
completion
orchestration
of
the
thought
process
in
the
higher
structures
of
nerve
cells
on
the
time
scales
which
have
been
neurologically
associated
with
consciousness
In
other
words
the
human
mind
is
a
biological
quantum
computer
and
as
such
is
capable
of
leaping
past
inductive
and
deductive
logic
into
what
Penrose
described
as
computable
and
non-computable
insights
Needless
to
say
the
core
theory
is
itself
controversial
see
the
wiki
above
for
details
The
friend
who
introduced
me
makes
the
further
claim
which
does
not
appear
in
the
wiki
but
may
appear
in
some
of
the
ancillary
references
that
due
to
entanglement
it
is
thus
possible
that
thought
processes
affect
and
are
affected
by
events
in
the
broader
spacetime
in
the
vicinity
and
NOT
in
the
vicinity
of
the
person
thinking
Thus
the
further
postulate
he
espoused
is
that
the
power
of
positive
thinking
thus
has
a
quantum
mechanical
underpinning
in
terms
of
entanglement
of
certain
thought
processes
with
the
external
universe
to
directly
effect
events
This
ranges
from
variations
of
the
placebo
effect
self-healing
and
faith
healing
up
to
the
viability
of
the
so-called
Jedi
philosophy
Pournelle
responds
Chesterton
famously
said
that
when
a
man
ceases
to
believe
in
God
he
will
believe
in
anything
And
I
respond
If
I
told
this
guy
about
Christianity
he
would
say
that
I'm
trying
to
snow
him
with
mumbo-jumbo

She's
my
gal
What
was
that
famous
advertising
line
They
laughed
when
I
sat
down
at
the
piano...But
when
I
started
to
play
From
1925
Here's
a
link
From
CBS
News
Scott
Conroy
It
was
less
than
two
weeks
ago
when
Sarah
Palin
astonished
her
traveling
press
corps
by
lifting
the
curtain
literally
and
journeying
to
the
back
of
her
campaign
plane
to
answer
reporters
questions
for
the
first
time
after
40
days
on
the
campaign
trail
But
the
candidate
who
has
been
criticized
for
having
a
bunker
mentality
when
it
came
to
the
national
media
can
now
lay
legitimate
claim
to
being
more
accessible
than
either
Joe
Biden
or
Barack
Obama
In
the
past
two
days
alone
Palin
has
answered
questions
from
her
national
press
corps
on
three
separate
occasions
On
Saturday
she
held
another
plane
availability
and
on
Sunday
she
offered
an
impromptu
press
conference
on
the
tarmac
upon
landing
in
Colorado
Springs
A
few
minutes
later
she
answered
even
more
questions
from
reporters
during
an
off-the-record
stop
at
a
local
ice
cream
shop
By
contrast
Biden
hasn't
held
a
press
conference
in
more
than
a
month
and
Obama
hasn't
taken
questions
from
his
full
traveling
press
corps
since
the
end
of
September
John
McCain?who
spent
most
of
the
primary
season
holding
what
seemed
like
one
never-ending
media
availability?hasn't
done
one
since
Sept
23
She
won't
get
a
lot
of
credit
for
this---it's
the
job
of
the
press
to
be
useful
idiots
and
get
the
lefty
candidate
elected
But
I'm
smiling
right
now
thinking
it
was
less
than
a
month
ago
that
people
were
sneering
that
Sarah
couldn't
handle
the
press
And
now
she's
doing
it
as
Willie
Brown
said
like
she
was
just
BS-ing
on
the
street
with
the
meter
maid
Link
And
if
you
would
read
that
piece
by
Brown
you
will
notice
the
last
line
As
for
Palin
herself
she
is
going
to
be
very
very
effective
on
the
campaign
trail
especially
if
McCain's
people
can
figure
out
how
to
gently
keep
her
from
getting
into
confrontations
with
the
press
HA
HA
Way
past
that
Willie
Brown
I
put
my
chips
on
Sarah
from
day
one
and
vicariously
endured
the
abuse
and
lies
thrown
at
her
So
NOTICE
THIS
lefty
losers
Sarah's
the
real
deal
Obama's
the
clever
bullshitter
And
you
know
it
in
your
hearts
You
knew
it
from
the
beginning
that's
why
you
hated
her

I'm
proud
to
be
stupid
Orrin
Judd
on
the
stupid
party
Quoting
Joe
Knippenberg]....But
for
me
the
more
interesting
reason
is
the
one
to
which
the
late
William
F
Buckley
Jr
alluded
To
the
degree
that
intelligence
is
connected
with
proud
self-assertion
a
hubristic
belief
in
one's
own
capacity
to
understand
and
remake
the
world
it
tends
not
to
be
conservative
or
respectful
of
the
lessons
and
burdens
of
the
past
It
looks
forward
to
the
change
it
can
effect
as
it
rationalizes
and
humanizes
the
world
It
does
not
bow
before
anyone
least
of
all
a
creator
God
Nonetheless
there
are
some
smart
and
learned
people
who
don't
take
this
view
Orrin
While
he
objects
to
the
term
stupid
Mr
Knippenberg
points
to
the
reason
that
it
is
correct
to
consider
conservatism
the
Stupid
Party
If
Intellectualism
can
be
said
as
seems
fair
to
be
the
hubristic
belief
in
remaking
the
world
according
to
one's
own
rationalizations
then
conservatism
is
profoundly
anti-intellectual
Conservatism
which
accepts
Creation
as
a
gift
from
God
and
men
as
beholden
to
the
lessons
of
the
past
can
even
be
said
to
be
stupid
This
is
particularly
clear
in
the
sphere
of
morality
where
conservatism
proceeds
from
the
idea
that
as
Erik
Maria
Ritter
von
Kuehnelt-Leddihn
puts
it
in
Leftism
Man
is
A
person
with
an
intransferable
destiny
unique
created
in
the
image
of
God
responsible
to
God
endowed
with
an
immortal
soul
or
as
Jacques
Maritain
put
it
in
The
Person
and
the
Common
Good
The
human
person
is
ordained
directly
to
God
as
to
its
absolute
ultimate
end
Every
variation
of
Intellectualism
or
Leftism
as
Mr
Kuehnelt-Leddihn
would
have
had
it
is
just
a
form
of
rebellion
against
this
stupid
recognition
that
we
are
Created
by
and
responsible
to
God
rather
than
self-created
and
responsible
only
to
the
self
This
latter
bit
of
foolishness
reaches
its
apotheosis
in
Richard
Dawkin's
delusion
of
existence
being
the
product
of
selfish
genes
Mr
Dawkins
being
not
coincidentally
one
of
the
popularizers
of
the
term
Brights

Crooked
picture...unbearable
Kathy
Shaidle
If
you
vote
for
Obama
because
he's
black
you're
a
racist
a
moron
or
both
And
that
includes
Colin
Powell
I
agree
Actually
there
is
another
possibility
Perhaps
people
are
supporting
Obama
just
as
an
artistic
convention
If
you
look
at
advertising
or
television
or
movies
you
will
see
that
it
is
an
unwritten
law
that
any
group
pictured
that
has
more
than
X
number
of
people
must
have
someone
at
least
vaguely
dark-skinned/black
included
Imagine
you
worked
at
an
advertising
agency
and
you
were
mocking-up
an
ad
that
claimed
that
mathematicians
preferred
your
client's
brand
of
whisky
The
fact
that
mathematicians
are
overwhelmingly
white
or
asian
and
male
would
not
matter
in
the
slightest
The
picture
of
happy
carousers
would
still
have
its
quota
of
blacks
and
women
Perhaps
people
really
support
Obama
just
because
it's
a
compulsion
like
the
way
some
people
have
to
straighten
a
crooked
picture
on
the
wall

Ignore
this
stuff
it
doesn't
fit
the
template
Matthew
Hoy
Last
summer
the
global
warming
alarmists
were
predicting
an
ice-free
arctic
One
environmental
activist
vowed
to
kayak
to
the
north
pole
to
highlight
the
dangerous
global
warming
Well
the
arctic
didn't
become
ice-free
and
that
poor
kayaker
had
to
turn
back
Anthony
Watts
has
been
watching
the
numbers
and
after
a
record-low
sea
ice
coverage
in
2007
this
year
has
been
cooler
with
more
ice
than
last
In
the
past
few
weeks
ice
has
been
growing
at
a
near-record
rate
Funny
how
we
keep
hearing
such
stuff
Read
on
for
some
fancy
footwork
from
the
National
Snow
and
Ice
Data
Center
Kayaking
to
the
North
Pole
Reminds
me
of
a
funny
story
from
long
ago
here
in
the
SF
Bay
Area
Some
guy
announced
he
was
going
to
paddle
a
rubber
boat
across
the
Pacific
Ocean
to
visit
his
girlfriend
in
Vietnam
The
morning
news
had
him
leaving
Berkeley
crossing
the
bay
and
showed

on
the
previous

The

I
think
you're
wide
of
the
mark
John
The
coercion
in
the
case
of
gay
marriage
lies
not
in
the
marriage
itself
one
is
free
to
marry
or
not
marry
as
one
pleases
The
coercion
lies
in
teaching
things
to
kids
who
aren't
old
enough
to
make
sense
of
them
So
the
anecdote
about
the
cute
little
Hispanic
girl
isn't
an
argument
against
gay
marriage
it's
an
argument
against
government-run
schools
which
are
often
captured
by
people
who
really
shouldn't
be
trusted
with
the
power
to
ram
things
down
the
throats
of
unsuspecting
children
You've
just
pushed
the
underlying
problem
away
not
confronted
it
The
message
comes
from
a
hundred
directions
not
just
public
schools
And
private
schools
want
to
push
the
same
message
at
least
here
in
SF
Coming
soon
to
a
town
near
you
Hollywood
and
Internet
too
In
our
world
we
have
a
LOT
of
people
who
want
to
change
the
world
into
something
very
different
And
it's
hard
to
discuss
this
because
we
are
using
different
terminology
In
your
terms
that
goal
is
some
sort
of
socialism
Something
like
the
Euro-socialist
welfare
state
You
see
the
growth
of
the
state
as
the
problem
and
you
are
right--that's
a
large
part
of
the
plan
Though
notice
that
there
no
longer
seems
to
be
any
worship
of
the
state
as
there
was
in
fascist
and
communist
regimes.No
demands
for
sacrifice
for
the
state
In
my
terms
the
goal
is
to
free
themselves
of
anything
that
the
individual
can
feel
as
being
bigger
than
the
self
That's
the
nihilism
I
keep
harping
about
The
goal
is
making
oneself
God
I
would
say
that
gay
marriage
and
socialism
and
radical
feminism
and
the
welfare
state
are
exactly
the
same
problem
in
different
dress
They
all
have
the
same
underlying
goal
We
are
allies
in
a
vast
struggle
with
people
who
are
foes
of
libertarianism
conservatism
democracy
religion
and
tradition
But
their
tactics
are
like
the
peddling
of
a
dangerous
and
seductive
addictive
drug
One
whose
harms
only
show
up
slowly
and
whose
pleasures
are
immediate
Not
like
the
old
socialist
revolutions---there's
no
Comintern
anymore
For
want
of
common
terms
I'll
call
the
problem
the
Drug
Libertarianism
doesn't
have
a
good
answer
Less
government
doesn't
get
rid
of
the
problem
The
front
line
is
everywhere
not
just
government
Art
architecture
literature
journalism
entertainment
all
are
war
zones
All
are
being
churned
and
transformed
like
a
WWI
battlefield
The
meanings
of
the
very
words
we
speak
are
being
morphed
sometimes
deliberately
And
recently
we've
seen
capitalist
bastions
on
Wall
Street
turn
out
to
be
Democrat
strongholds
Actually
the
battleground
is
every
person
Libertarianism
says
to
let
people
choose
but
the
very
essence
of
the
people
who
do
the
choosing
is
what
is
being
struggled
over
and
changed
Changed
by
this
Drug
that
gives
people
the
power
to
be
like
gods
To
be
in
control
of
themselves
and
others
I'm
sure
most
libertarians
would
agree
that
this
drug
should
be
resisted
BUT
the
ideas
that
help
fight
against
the
drug
did
not
come
from
libertarianism
You
have
inherited
those
ideas
as
part
of
the
package
of
Western---especially
Jewish
and
Christian---civilization
CONTINUE
READING
Rambling
answer
to
libertarian
comment
Libertarianism
piggy-backs
on
a
great
inheritance
of
Western
ideas
and
virtues
And
you
are
assuming
that
most
people
here
have
a
good
stock
of
those
And
that
therefore
you
can
give
people
lots
of
free
choice
and
expect
good
things
But
libertarianism
has
no
answer
to
the
problem
of
when
those
ideas
themselves
slip
away
or
grow
dim
I
think
that
is
happening
To
fight
this
insidious
Drug
we
can't
just
rely
on
a
diminishing
stock
of
inherited
virtue
My
evidence
can
be
expressed
in
one
word
Europe
We've
been
watching
Europe
ratchet
down
down
down
for
the
last
century
at
least
And
to
me
one
of
the
most
salient
features
of
this
decline
is
that
at
any
particular
moment
people
assume
that
ordinary
European
people
will
stay
the
same
They
assume
that
the
German
will
always
be
hard-working
That
the
Englishman's
home
will
be
his
castle
That
the
Spaniard
will
be
Catholic
and
the
Italian
will
have
a
big
extended
family
with
lots
of
pasta-munching
bambinos
That
the
Frenchman
will
fight
for
La
Patrie
But
all
those
assumptions
have
been
WRONG
If
you
bet
any
chips
on
the
character
the
inherited
ideas
and
culture
on
the
virtues
of
Europeans
you've
lost
your
bet
And
this
wasn't
like
a
fight
between
good
guys
and
bad
guys
It
was
a
matter
of
people
being
hollowed
out
Of
virtue
just
draining
away
mysteriously
A
telling
statistic
By
the
year
2050
60
of
Italians
will
not
know
what
it
is
like
to
have
a
brother
or
a
sister
or
an
aunt
or
an
uncle
or
a
nephew
or
a
niece
Italy
is
in
demographic
collapse
now
and
will
soon
be
in
population
collapse
It
is
economically
stagnant
and
produces
no
exciting
new
ideas
or
inventions
But
who
is
the
bad
guy
Who
forced
this
upon
the
Italians
No
one
they
chose
it
What
does
libertarianism
offer
here
How
does
it
explain
this
I
think
you
are
carrying
a
knife
to
a
shotgun
fight
You
are
unarmed

The
Church
is
on
the
firing
line
This
new
age
will
have
the
merit
of
discarding
that
hypocrisy
by
which
the
modern
world
evoked
the
forms
without
the
substance
of
Christianity
In
so
doing
the
post-Christian
man
will
have
to
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
to
live
without
Christ
is
a
hard
choice
with
serious
even
brutal
consequences
The
believer
too
will
be
faced
with
the
increasingly
inescapable
realization
the
faith
itself
is
a
hard
choice
On
the
one
hand
this
brave
new
post-Christian
world
will
have
little
place
in
it
for
him
On
the
other
hand
he
will
discover
in
all
their
fullness
the
demands
his
faith
makes
upon
him
when
he
has
to
live
it
without
the
external
affirmations
afforded
him
within
a
Christian
culture
He
may
indeed
discover
for
the
first
time
as
Guardini
suggests
what
it
really
means
to
be
a
Christian
At
the
same
time
it
may
well
be
that
the
massive
failure
of
Christendom
itself
as
Percy
puts
it
is
already
creating
the
only
conditions
in
the
West
at
least
within
which
a
genuine
renewal
of
faith
can
take
place
During
a
conversation
I
had
with
Walker
Percy
a
few
months
before
his
death
he
commented
that
in
his
judgement
the
Church
is
in
a
better
position
today
than
she
has
been
in
centuries
He
thought
the
identification
of
culture
and
faith
was
disastrous
for
the
Church
in
many
ways
He
cited
Kierkegaard's
observation
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
become
a
Christian
in
Christendom
That
is
people
within
a
Christian
culture
are
inclined
to
believe
they
automatically
become
Christians
simply
by
virtue
of
having
been
born
into
that
culture
Today
people
can
see
that
no
such
identification
exists
and
that
a
choice
must
therefore
be
made
He
believed
a
new
consciousness
is
emerging
and
thus
the
realization
that
the
Church
and
the
culture
are
at
odds
is
a
key
perhaps
even
the
key
element
of
this
new
consciousness
As
a
result
the
Church
is
on
the
firing
line
and
that
as
Percy
saw
it
is
exactly
where
she
properly
belongs

The
New
Progressive
Person
This
post
at
The
Corner
by
Maggie
Gallagher
focused
my
previously-amorphous
thoughts
on
one
of
the
reasons
I
think
libertarianism
is
profoundly
unwise
Any
libertarian
will
understand
that
trying
to
force
people
to
act
contrary
to
the
market
is
asking
for
trouble
If
say
his
city
government
decided
to
issue
voluntary
guidelines
on
what
were
fair
wages
for
various
jobs
alarm
bells
would
go
off
in
his
head
He
would
NOT
say
It's
voluntary
so
what
do
I
care
Because
he
knows
darn
well
that
coercion
is
the
next
step
And
since
enforcing
such
a
thing
would
be
like
herding
cats
there
would
have
to
be
a
LOT
of
cowboys
with
a
LOT
of
coercive
power
to
move
the
herd
Just
collecting
the
needed
information
would
require
massive
government
intrusion
on
people's
lives
Note
The
libertarian
could
be
a
she
but
I'm
flouting
the
voluntary
guidelines
for
non-sexist
language
BUT
the
same
libertarian
on
questions
like
Gay
Marriage
seems
to
be
incapable
of
understanding
that
trying
to
go
against
human
nature
is
equally
a
task
that
requires
coercion
Government
coercion
It's
like
trying
to
force
water
to
run
uphill
To
say
that
Gay
Marriage---or
any
marriage---is
just
a
private
matter
is
a
cowardly
absurdity
The
Soviet
Union
had
this
idea
that
their
totalitarian
state
was
going
to
create
The
New
Soviet
Man
Who
would
be
naturally
socialist
so
that
further
coercion
would
not
be
necessary
No
libertarian
thinks
that
will
ever
work
But
the
same
libertarian
seems
blind
to
the
fact
that
Gay
Marriage
inevitably
entails
people
trying
to
create
The
New
Progressive
Person
The
latest
Protect
Marriage
Yes
on
8
television
ad
in
California
shows
an
incredibly
cute
8
year
old
Hispanic
girl
bringing
the
book
King
and
King
home
to
her
mother
saying
Guess
what
I
learned
in
school
today
I
can
marry
a
princess
The
anti-Prop
8
pro
gay
marriage
crowd
is
running
ads
charging
this
whole
idea
that
public
schools
will
teach
gay
marriage
is
just
a
lie
The
latest
press
release
from
the
Protect
Marriage
Yes
on
8
campaign
in
California
rather
cleverly
points
out
the
same
groups
now
charging
it's
a
lie
public
schools
will
teach
about
gay
marriage
whether
parents
like
it
or
not
were
just
in
court
in
Massachussetts
filing
amicus
briefs
arguing
parents
don't
have
any
right
to
opt
their
children
out
of
the
pro-gay
marriage
curriculum
Just

NOTE
I
haven't
had
the
time
psychic
energy
to
move
my
pre-August

archives
yet
Go
Here
for
exciting
earlier
episodes
starting
in
November

2001
me
quit
blogging
With
so
many
members
of
the
human
race
needing
to
be
mocked
and
vilified

That
which
does
not
kill
us
makes
us
angry
Dave
Trowbridge
From
all
that
terror
teaches
From
lies
of
tongue
and
pen
From
all
the
easy
speeches
That
comfort
cruel
men
From
sale
and
profanation
Of
honor
and
the
sword
From
sleep
and
from
damnation
Deliver
us
good

an
imaginary
consolation

I
love
what
is
delicate
Luminous
brave
what
belongs
to
the
sunlight
That's
what
I
crave
Sappho
What
thou
lov'st
well
remains
the
rest
is
dross
What
thou
lov'st
well
shall
not
be
reft
from
thee
Ezra
Pound
Every
high
civilization
decays
by
forgetting
obvious
things

CHESTERTON
A
good
man
would
rather
know
his
infirmity
than
the
foundations
of
the
earth
or
the
heights
of
the
heavens

Andrewes
