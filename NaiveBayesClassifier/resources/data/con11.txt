Cover-Up
UPDATE
Jeffrey
Goldberg
asks
in
that
ultra-Conservative
rag
The
Atlantic
What
is
the
LA
Times
Hiding
Good
question
I
don't
think
it's
entirely
necessary
for
me
to
explain
once
again
why
I
believe
that
Rashid
Khalidi
is
not
a
danger
to
the
Republic
I
also
don't
think
I
have
to
rehearse
the
controversial
idea
that
Barack
Obama
was
not
in
fact
the
Hyde
Park
chapter
president
of
the
PFLP-GC
That
was
Rahm
Emanuel
But
there's
a
video
out
there
of
Obama
saying
kind
things
about
Khalidi
and
on
the
general
principle
that
information
in
an
open
society
shouldn't
be
kept
secret
and
that
the
voters
should
make
up
their
own
minds
about
whether
or
not
they
trust
certain
candidates
this
video
should
be
set
free
But
a
pro-censorship
organization
called
the
Los
Angeles
Times
which
has
the
tape
in
its
possession
is
hiding
it
for
reasons
it
won't
fully
explain
And
it's
looking
more
and
more
ridiculous
each
passing
day
I
understand
that
the
tape
was
leaked
to
the
Times
by
a
source
or
sources
unknown
and
that
an
agreement
was
struck
with
that
source
to
keep
the
tape
hidden
but
the
tape
has
been
described
in
a
Times
story
already
and
it
quite
obviously
contains
no
state
secrets
I
also
suspect
that
the
tape
could
be
posted
in
such
a
way
as
to
obscure
its
origins
The
Times
however
won't
discuss
in
detail
why
it's
keeping
the
tape
from
its
readers
and
the
newspaper's
readers
representative
Jamie
Gold
has
lined
up
against
the
readers
and
argued
against
the
release
of
the
tape.It
no
longer
IS
an
open
society
when
newspapers
determine
what
secrets
can
be
kept
i.e
ANYTHING
that
casts
dispersions
on
Barack
Obama
and
what
secrets
are
things
the
public
needs
to
know
e.g
how
we
are
tracking
terrorists
phone
calls
and
money
All
the
animals
are
equal
but
some
are
more
equal
than
others
never
rang
so

Former
ACORN
Staffer
Testifies
to
Obama
Connection
Whoa
From
the
Pittsburgh
Tribune-Review
HARRISBURG
A
former
staffer
for
an
affiliate
of
the
Association
of
Community
Organizations
for
Reform
Now
testified
today
that
the
organization
was
provided
a
donor
list
from
the
presidential
campaign
of
Barack
Obama
in
late
2007
for
fundraising
efforts
Anita
Moncrief
a
former
Washington
D.C
staffer
for
Project
Vote
which
she
described
as
a
sister
organization
of
ACORN
said
her
supervisor
told
her
the
list
of
campaign
contributors
came
from
the
Obama
campaign
Moncrief
said
she
has
a
copy
of
a
development
plan
that
outlines
how
Obama
contributors
who
had
maxed
out
under
federal
contribution
limits
would
be
targeted
to
give
to
Project
Vote
and
that
it
was
her
job
to
identify
such
contributors
So
much
for
the
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
ACORN

WASHINGTON

Sen
Barack

is
allowing
donors
to
use
largely
untraceable
prepaid

that

Faced
with

the

has
also
chosen
not
to
use
basic
security
measures
to
prevent
potentially
illegal
or
anonymous
contributions
from
flowing
into
its

aides
acknowledged
Instead
the

is
scrutinizing
its

for
improper

after
the

Around
Bill
Whittle
is

The
Drudge
Report
this
morning
led
off
with
a
link
to
audio
of
Barack
Obama
on
WBEZ
a
Chicago
public
radio
station
And
this
time
Barack
Obama
was
not
eight
years
old
when
the
bomb
went
off
Speaking
on
a
call-in
radio
show
in
2001
you
can
hear
Senator
Obama
say
things
that
should
profoundly
shock
any
American
or
at
least
those
who
have
not
taken
the
time
to
dig
deeply
enough
into
this
man's
beliefs
and
affiliations
Abandon
all
hope
ye
who
enter
here
Barack
Obama
in
2001
You
know
if
you
look
at
the
victories
and
failures
of
the
civil-rights
movement
and
its
litigation
strategy
in
the
court
I
think
where
it
succeeded
was
to
vest
formal
rights
in
previously
dispossessed
peoples
So
that
I
would
now
have
the
right
to
vote
I
would
now
be
able
to
sit
at
a
lunch
counter
and
order
and
as
long
as
I
could
pay
for
it
I'd
be
okay
but
the
Supreme
Court
never
entered
into
the
issues
of
redistribution
of
wealth
and
sort
of
more
basic
issues
of
political
and
economic
justice
in
this
society
And
uh
to
that
extent
as
radical
as
I
think
people
tried
to
characterize
the
Warren
Court
it
wasn't
that
radical
It
didn't
break
free
from
the
essential
constraints
that
were
placed
by
the
Founding
Fathers
in
the
Constitution
at
least
as
it's
been
interpreted
and
Warren
Court
interpreted
it
in
the
same
way
that
generally
the
Constitution
is
a
charter
of
negative
liberties
It
says
what
the
states
can't
do
to
you
says
what
the
federal
government
can't
do
to
you
but
it
doesn't
say
what
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government
must
do
on
your
behalf
And
that
hasn't
shifted
and
one
of
the
I
think
the
tragedies
of
the
civil-rights
movement
was
because
the
civil-rights
movement
became
so
court-focused
uh
I
think
that
there
was
a
tendency
to
lose
track
of
the
political
and
community
organizing
and
activities
on
the
ground
that
are
able
to
put
together
the
actual
coalitions
of
power
through
which
you
bring
about
redistributive
change
And
in
some
ways
we
still
suffer
from
that.A
caller
then
helpfully
asks
The
gentleman
made
the
point
that
the
Warren
Court
wasn't
terribly
radical
My
question
is
with
economic
changes
my
question
is
is
it
too
late
for
that
kind
of
reparative
work
economically
and
is
that
the
appropriate
place
for
reparative
economic
work
to
change
place
Obama
replies
You
know
I'm
not
optimistic
about
bringing
about
major
redistributive
change
through
the
courts
The
institution
just
isn't
structured
that
way
snip
You
start
getting
into
all
sorts
of
separation
of
powers
issues
you
know
in
terms
of
the
court
monitoring
or
engaging
in
a
process
that
essentially
is
administrative
and
takes
a
lot
of
time
You
know
the
court
is
just
not
very
good
at
it
and
politically
it's
just
very
hard
to
legitimize
opinions
from
the
court
in
that
regard
So
I
think
that
although
you
can
craft
theoretical
justifications
for
it
legally
you
know
I
think
any
three
of
us
sitting
here
could
come
up
with
a
rationale
for
bringing
about
economic
change
through
the
courts
THE
FIRST
CIRCLE
OF
SHAME
There
is
nothing
vague
or
ambiguous
about
this
Nothing
From
the
top
The
Supreme
Court
never
entered
into
the
issues
of
redistribution
of
wealth
and
sort
of
more
basic
issues
of
political
and
economic
justice
in
this
society
And
uh
to
that
extent
as
radical
as
I
think
people
tried
to
characterize
the
Warren
Court
it
wasn't
that
radical
If
the
second
highlighted
phrase
had
been
there
without
the
first
Obama's
defenders
would
have
bent
over
backwards
trying
to
spin
the
meaning
of
political
and
economic
justice
We
all
know
what
political
and
economic
justice
means
because
Barack
Obama
has
already
made
it
crystal
clear
a
second
earlier
It
means
redistribution
of
wealth
Not
the
creation
of
wealth
and
certainly
not
the
creation
of
opportunity
but
simply
taking
money
from
the
successful
and
hard-working
and
distributing
it
to
those
whom
the
government
decides
deserve
it
This
redistribution
of
wealth
he
states
essentially
is
administrative
and
takes
a
lot
of
time
It
is
an
administrative
task
Not
suitable
for
the
courts
More
suitable
for
the
chief
executive
Now
that's
just
garden-variety
socialism
which
apparently
is
not
a
big
deal
to
may
voters
So
I
would
appeal
to
any
American
who
claims
to
love
the
Constitution
and
to
revere
the
Founding
Fathers
I
will
not
only
appeal
to
you
I
will
beg
you
as
one
American
citizen
to
another
to
consider
this
next
statement
with
as
much
care
as
you
can
possibly
bring
to
bear
And
uh
to
that
extent
as
radical
as
I
think
people
tried
to
characterize
the
Warren
Court
it
wasn't
that
radical
It
didn't
break
free
from
the
essential
constraints
that
were
placed
by
the
Founding
Fathers
in
the
Constitution
at
least
as
it's
been
interpreted
and
the
Warren
Court
interpreted
it
in
the
same
way
that
generally
the
Constitution
is
a
charter
of
negative
liberties
it
says
what
the
states
can't
do
to
you
says
what
the
federal
government
can't
do
to
you
but
it
doesn't
say
what
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government
must
do
on
your
behalf
The
United
States
of
America
five
percent
of
the
world's
population
leads
the
world
economically
militarily
scientifically
and
culturally
and
by
a
spectacular
margin
Any
one
of
these
achievements
taken
alone
would
be
cause
for
enormous
pride
To
dominate
as
we
do
in
all
four
arenas
has
no
historical
precedent
That
we
have
achieved
so
much
in
so
many
areas
is
due
due
entirely
to
the
structure
of
our
society
as
outlined
in
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
The
entire
purpose
of
the
Constitution
was
to
limit
government
That
limitation
of
powers
is
what
has
unlocked
in
America
the
vast
human
potential
available
in
any
population
Barack
Obama
sees
that
limiting
of
government
not
as
a
lynchpin
but
rather
as
a
fatal
flaw
One
of
the
I
think
the
tragedies
of
the
Civil
Rights
movement
was
because
the
Civil
Rights
movement
became
so
court-focused
uh
I
think
that
there
was
a
tendency
to
lose
track
of
the
political
and
community
organizing
and
activities
on
the
ground
that
are
able
to
put
together
the
actual
coalitions
of
power
through
which
you
bring
about
redistributive
change
And
in
some
ways
we
still
suffer
from
that
There
is
no
room
for
wiggle
or
misunderstanding
here
This
is
not
edited
copy
There
is
nothing
out
of
context
for
the
entire
thing
is
context
the
context
of
what
Barack
Obama
believes
You
and
I
do
not
have
to
guess
at
what
he
believes
or
try
to
interpret
what
he
believes
He
says
what
he
believes
We
have
in
our
storied
history
elected
Democrats
and
Republicans
liberals
and
conservatives
and
moderates
We
have
fought
and
will
continue
to
fight
pitched
battles
about
how
best
to
govern
this
nation
But
we
have
never
ever
in
our
232-year
history
elected
a
president
who
so
completely
and
openly
opposed
the
idea
of
limited
government
the
absolute
cornerstone
of
makes
the
United
States
of
America
unique
and
exceptional
If
this
does
not
frighten
you
regardless
of
your
political
affiliation
then
you
deserve
what
this
man
will
deliver
with
both
houses
of
Congress
a
filibuster-proof
Senate
and
to
quote
Senator
Obama
again
a
righteous
wind
at
our
backs
That
a
man
so
clear
in
his
understanding
of
the
Constitution
and
so
opposed
to
the
basic
tenets
it
provides
against
tyranny
and
the
abuse
of
power
can
run
for
president
of
the
United
States
is
shameful
enough
We're
just
getting
started
THE
SECOND
CIRCLE
OF
SHAME
Mercifully
shorter
than
the
first
and
simply
this
I
happen
to
know
the
person
who
found
this
audio
It
is
an
individual
person
with
no
more
resources
than
a
desire
to
know
everything
that
he
or
she
can
about
who
might
be
the
next
president
of
the
United
States
and
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
I
know
that
this
person
does
not
have
teams
of
highly
paid
professionals
does
not
work
out
of
a
corner
office
in
a
skyscraper
in
New
York
does
not
have
access
to
all
of
the
subtle
and
hidden
conduits
of
information
who
possesses
no
network
television
stations
owns
no
satellite
time
does
not
receive
billions
in
advertising
dollars
and
has
a
staff
of
exactly
one
I
do
not
blame
Barack
Obama
for
believing
in
wealth
distribution
That's
his
right
as
an
American
I
do
blame
him
for
lying
about
what
he
believes
But
his
entire
life
has
been
applying
for
the
next
job
at
the
expense
of
the
current
one
He's
at
the
end
of
the
line
now
I
do
however
blame
the
press
for
allowing
an
individual
citizen
to
do
the
work
that
they
employ
standing
armies
of
so-called
professionals
for
I
know
they
are
capable
of
this
kind
of
investigative
journalism
It
only
took
them
a
day
or
two
to
damage
Sarah
Palin
with
wild
accusations
about
her
baby's
paternity
and
less
time
than
that
to
destroy
a
man
who
happened
to
be
playing
ball
when
the
Messiah
decided
to
roll
up
looking
for
a
few
more
votes
on
the
way
to
the
inevitable
coronation
We
no
longer
have
an
independent
fair
investigative
press
That
is
abundantly
clear
to
everyone
even
the
press
It
is
just
another
of
the
facts
that
they
refuse
to
report
because
it
does
not
suit
them
Remember
this
America
The
press
did
not
break
this
story
A
single
citizen
on
the
Internet
did
There
is
a
special
hell
for
you
journalists
out
there
a
hell
made
specifically
for
you
narcissists
and
elitists
who
think
you
have
the
right
to
determine
which
information
is
passed
on
to
the
electorate
and
which
is
not
There
is
a
bit
more
but
you
get
the
idea
And
speaking
of
the
death
of
journalism
Especially
pay
attention
to
this
Andrew
McCarthy
story
of
an
LA
Times
refusing
to
release
before
the
election
anyway
a
tape
it
has
of
Obama
sharing
a
toast
with
PLO
Supporters

asks
a
question
that
clearly
shows

assessment
of
the
media
is
spot
on
Let's
try
a
thought
experiment
Say
John
McCain
attended
a
party
at
which
known
racists
and
terror
mongers
were
in
attendance
Say
testimonials
were
given
including
a
glowing
one
by
McCain
for
the
benefit
of
the
guest
of
honor
who
happened
to
be
a
top
apologist
for
terrorists
Say
McCain
not
only
gave
a
speech
but
stood
by
in
tacit
approval
and
solidarity
while
other
racists
and
terror
mongers
gave
speeches
that
reeked
of
hatred
for
an
American
ally
and
rationalizations
of
terror
attacks
Now
let's
say
the
Los
Angeles
Times
obtained
a
videotape
of
the
party
Question
Is
there
any
chance
any
chance
the
Times
would
not
release
the
tape
and
publish
front-page
story
after
story
about
the
gory
details
with
the
usual
accompanying
chorus
of
sanctimony
from
the
oped
commentariat
Is
there
any
chance
if
the
Times
was
the
least
bit
reluctant
about
publishing
remember
we're
pretending
here
that
the
rest
of
the
mainstream
media
y'know
the
guys
who
drove
Trent
Lott
out
of
his
leadership
position
over
a
birthday-party
toast
would
not
be
screaming
for
the

of
the

UPDATE
More
from

on

cover-up
The

Times
is
holding
a
video
that
shows
Barack
Obama
celebrating
with
a
group
of
Palestinians
who
are
openly
hostile
towards
Israel
Barack
Obama
even
gives
a
toast
to
a
former
PLO
operative
at
this
celebration
If
the
American
public
saw
this
radical
side
of
Barack
Obama
it
is
unlikely
he
would
ever
be
elected
president
But
the

Washington
Post
reports
on
Obama
Campaign
Credit
Card
Fraud--but
somehow
Avoids
the
CRITICAL
Quesion
Although
the
Washington
Post
is
now
reporting
about
the
Obama
Campaign's
unbridled
unchecked
credit
card
donations
from
all
of
the
above
it
still
is
obviously
missing
the
whole
point
this
not
only
invites
fraud
it
IS
fraud
Ed
Morrissey
comments
Mosk
never
thinks
to
ask
the
one
question
that
has
already
occurred
to
conservative
bloggers
What
makes
the
Obama
campaign
different
from
online
retail
operations
After
all
we
have
spent
almost
15
years
buying
and
selling
products
and
services
on
the
Internet
and
retailers
know
how
to
protect
themselves
and
their
customers
They
employ
a
system
that
compares
the
billing
information
on
the
order
to
the
information
in
the
credit-card
system
and
when
they
don't
match
the
sale
gets
denied
Credit-card
companies
have
gone
an
extra
step
in
recent
years
by
adding
a
security
code
to
protect
against
fraudulent
use
The
McCain
campaign
apparently
uses
these
systems
to
prevent
fraud
Why
doesn't
Team
Obama
That's
the
pertinent
question
Systems
have
existed
for
years
to
prevent
exactly
the
kind
of
fraud
that
has
occurred
in
Obama's
fundraising
Why
did
Team
Obama
deliberately
avoid
using
them
Perhaps
the
FEC
could
discover
the
answer
to
that
question
if
they
were
inclined
to
do
their
jobs
It
seems
very
clear
that
someone
at
Team
Obama
didn't
want
to
stop
credit-card
fraud
as
long
as
it
helped
them
raise
funds
That's
a
story
that
the
Tanning
Bed
Media
ought
to
cover
and
probably
won't

No
NOT
too
much
of
a
Stretch
Glenn
Reynolds
crafts
a
similie
emphasis
mine
SIX
ALABAMA
COUNTIES
have
more
registered
voters
than
voting-age
people
Plus
this
Well
considering
a
dog
here
in
Pike
County
received
a
personally
addressed
voter
registration
form
this
month
from
the
Alabama
Democratic
Party
we'd
have
to
say
there's
legitimate
cause
for
concern
What's
the
big
deal
We've
had
yellow
dog
Democrats
in
the
South
for
years
But
I
wonder
if
the
voting
system
is
like
the
credit
system
with
same-day
registration
and
limited
ID
requirements
kind
of
like
those
no
doc
loans
and
questionable
voting
machines
being
like
the
dubious
credit-rating
schemes
As
with
the
credit
system
lots
of
insiders
are
making
out
too
well
from
the
current
system
to
want
to
fix
it
but
when
the
inevitable
crash
comes
the
rest
of
us
will
pay
the
price
Or
is
that
analogy
too
much
of
a
stretch
And

there
is
the

of
the

Plan--using

GREG
MANKIW
FOCUSES
ON
WHAT'S
IMPORTANT
Here
is
a
question
that
you
may
have
been
thinking
about
How
do
the
different
candidates
tax
plans
affect
Greg
Mankiw's
incentive
to
work
If
there
were
no
taxes
so
t1=t2=t3=t4=0
then
1
earned
today
would
yield
my
kids
28
That
is
simply
the
miracle
of
compounding
Under
the
McCain
plan
t1=.35
t2=.25
t3=.15
and
t4=.15
In
this
case
a
dollar
earned
today
yields
my
kids
4.81
That
is
even
under
the
low-tax
McCain
plan
my
incentive
to
work
is
cut
by
83
percent
compared
to
the
situation
without
taxes
Under
the
Obama
plan
t1=.43
t2=.35
t3=.2
and
t4=.45
In
this
case
a
dollar
earned
today
yields
my
kids
1.85
That
is
Obama's
proposed
tax
hikes
reduce
my
incentive
to
work
by
62
percent
compared
to
the
McCain
plan
and
by
93
percent
compared
to
the
no-tax
scenario
In
a
sense
putting
the
various
pieces
of
the
tax
system
together
I
would
be
facing
a
marginal
tax
rate
of
93
percent
The
bottom
line
If
you
are
one
of
those
people
out
there
trying
to
induce
me
to
do
some
work
for
you
there
is
a
good
chance
I
will
turn
you
down
And
the
likelihood
will
go
up
after
President
Obama
puts
his
tax
plan
in
place
Perhaps
this
will
lead
a
lot
of
people
to
go

UPDATED/BUMPED
MAYBE
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
POST
OF
THE
YEAR
AYERS
DISCUSSED
REDUCATION
AND
MASS
MURDER
OF
POLITICAL
ENEMIES
UPDATE
I
bumped
this
above
the
Ashley
Todd
story
because
the
information
about
Ayers
is
something
that
everyone
should
read
Read
the
entire
report
it
is
chilling
and
a
reminder
that
sociopaths
don't
change
their
stripes
as
they
get
older
Ayers/Dohrn
stating
in
2001
that
they
would
do
it
again
and
didn't
do
enough
These
people
have
not
changed
their
beliefs--and
they
were
Obama's
mentors
Mark
Levin
also
began
his
show
with
this
yesterday
As
a
side
item
here
is
a
video
of
Obama
talking
about
redistributing
wealth
although
this
vid
not
exactly
breaking
news
it
in
1995
watch
here
Note
that
this
video
was
filmed
in
the
same
timeframe
when
Obama
was
actively
collaborating
with
Ayers
and
Dohrn
in
distributing
over
50
million
in
Annenberg
dollars
to
friends
in
the
Chicago
area
it
also
should
be
noted
that
Obama
announced
his
initial
political
campaign
from
the
living
room
of
Ayers
and
Dohrn
While
we
are
on
the
subject
of
the
Weather
Underground
This
is
the
man
who
took
Barack
Obama
personally
under
his
left
wing
emphasis
mine
via
Bob
Owens
Just
a
Little
Genocide
I
asked
well
what
is
going
to
happen
to
those
people
we
can't
reeducate
that
are
diehard
capitalists
and
the
reply
was
that
they'd
have
to
be
eliminated
And
when
I
pursued
this
further
they
estimated
they
would
have
to
eliminate
25
million
people
in
these
reeducation
centers
And
when
I
say
eliminate
I
mean
kill
Twenty-five
million
people
I
want
you
to
imagine
sitting
in
a
room
with
25
people
most
of
which
have
graduate
degrees
from
Columbia
and
other
well-known
educational
centers
and
hear
them
figuring
out
the
logistics
for
the
elimination
of
25
million
people
And
they
were
dead
serious
This
was
the
testimony
of
FBI
informant
Larry
Grathwohl
in
the
1982
documentary
No
Place
to
Hide
The
25
people
plotting
the
extermination
of
the
25
million
Americans
who
would
bitterly
cling
to
the
American
way
of
life
The
Weather
Underground
led
by
Bill
Ayers
and
Bernadine
Dohrn
The
genocide
of
25
million
Americans
for
daring
to
cling
to
the
American
way
of
life
was
just
part
of
their
reeducation
plan
for
a
communist
America
I
do
not
expect
you
to
take
my
word
for
it
Watch
the
documentary
clip
above
And
if
there
are
those
of
you
who
don't
trust
Grathwohl
despite
the
lives
he's
saved
foiling
at
least
two
Weathermen
attempts
at
mass
murder
you
can
simply
see
what
Ayers
and
Dohrn
wrote
in
their
own
words
Zombie
has
found
an
extremely
rare
out
of
print
edition
of
Prairie
Fire
the
communist
manifesto
authored
by
Ayers
and
Dohrn
as
they
bombed
their
way
across
America
Read
the
report
for
yourself
You
will
want
to
take
Bob's
advice
trust
me
And
then
you
will
want
to
consider
THESE
are
the
people
who
took
Barack
Obama
under
their
wing
and
who
launched
his
first
political
campaign
from
their
LIVING
ROOM
The
question
should
not
only
be
what
did
Barack
Obama
know
about
Ayers--it
should
also
be
why
did
Ayers
and
Dohrn
take
such
a
personal
interest
in
Barack
Obama
Barack
Obama
in
my
opinion
really
IS
a
Communist
No
Obama
has
not
openly
advocated
genocide--but
his
political
mentors
did
Does
this
not
at
the
very
least
call
for
a
SERIOUS
examination
of
the
judgment
of
this
man
Not
to
mention
his
20-year
association
with
the
Rev
Wright
his
associations
with
Farrakhan's
Million
Man
March
and
his
dealings
with
the
corrupt
Rezko

that
report

B
on

UPDATE
It
appears
this
may
be
a
false
Police
report
Neil
Boortz
is
reporting
that
the
Police
did
not
take
this
photograph
and
they
did
not
find
any
video
tape
of
a
6'4
African-American
man
holding
her
up
at
that
ATM
machine
as
Ms
Todd
had
alleged
It
appears
that
she
may
have
had
many
of
us
fooled
The
police
are
asking
Todd
to
take
a
polygraph
and
are
saying
there
are
some
inconsistencies
This
is
truly
pathetic
and
disgusting
if
indeed
this
is
a
put-up
job
She
is
young
but
whoever
is
in
on
this
should
be
in
jail--(IF
guilty
Not
only
does
it
play
right
in
to
the
Carville-DNC
narrative
that
there
may
be
rioting
if
Obama
loses
hidden
message
vote
for
the
real
thugs...or
else
but
it
is
extremely
damaging
to
the
McCain
campaign
at
a
very
critical
weekend
juncture
As
to
rioting
etc
I
will
only
say
the
following
I
have
seen
and
heard
references
all
week
from
police
department
personnel
who
believe
that
there
could
be
unrest
in
big
cities
no
matter
who
wins
If
Obama
wins
it
could
turn
into
a
celebratory
riot
e.g
like
when
sports
teams
in
urban
areas
win
championships
If
Obama
loses--regardless
of
what
the
African-American
community
does
or
does
not
do--I
do
think
there
is
a
high
likelihood
in
some
large
urban
areas
Put
it
this
way
I
have
already
voted
and
I
do
not
intend
to
be
cruising
the
streets
of
downtown
Dallas
that
night
Police
are
definitely
beefing
up
their
street
presence
for
that
day
and
night
nationwide
But
I
think
it
is
shameful
for
the
DNC
to
be
parroting
this
argument
it
reeks
of
implied
threats
and
intimidation
in
order
to
suppress
the
McCain
vote
It
also
is
a
rather
neo-rascist
suggestion
playing
on
traditional
stereotypes
and
fears
of
the
African
American
community
I
do
not
discount
that
there
might
be
some
unrest--police
spokespersons
have
made
reference
to
email
traffic
being
intercepted
by
authorities
from
hard-left
organizers
working
to
create
violent
disturbances
if
the
Dems
lose
But
for
the
Democrats
like
Carville
this
week
loudly
proclaiming
rioting
and
unrest
if
the
election
is
close
and
McCain
wins
is
to
me
hypocritical
neo-racist
and
borders
on
intimidation
intended
to
suppress
the
Republican
turnout
We
all
know
what
lies
beneath
this
implication
But
to
me
the
real
story
is
the
hard-Left
organizing
that
is
going
on
to
actually
make
this
happen
Arguably
some
of
these
groups
are
getting
funding
from
the
same
big
money
sources
Soros
et
al
who
are
supporting
Obama
PS
this
to
people
who
actually
CARE
about
this
country
and
what
happens
to
it
YOU
OWE
IT
TO
THOSE
TROOPS
FIGHTING
FOR
OUR
RIGHT
TO
VOTE
to
go
cast
that
vote
If
the
Iraqis
facing
possible
death
threats
for
voting
in
their
election
can
stun
the
world
with
their
turnout
you
have
very
little
excuse
not
to
go
exercise
your
duty
as
a
citizen
here
If
you
have
fears
about
election
day
then
vote
early
Today
for
example
But
do
not
allow
these
thugs
and
their
mouthpieces
to
keep
you
away
from
that
duty
and
sacred
right
It
may
be
the
very
last
time
your
vote
carries
this
much
weight
in
preventing
State
Socialism
and
destroying
our
economy

A
20-year-old
woman
who
was
robbed
at
an
ATM
in

was
also
maimed
by

apparently
because

said
According
to

partners
at

Ashley
Todd
of
College
Station
Texas
was
using
an
ATM
at

and
Pearl
Street
just
before
9
p.m
Wednesday
when
a
man
approached
her
and
put
a
knife
to
her
throat
Police
spokeswoman
Diane
Richard
said
the
robber
took
60
from
Todd
then
became
angry
when
he
saw
a
McCain
bumper
sticker
on
the
victim's
car
The
attacker
then
punched
and
kicked
the
victim
before
using
the
knife
to
scratch
the
letter
B
into
her
face
Richard
said
The
Tribune-Review
reported
that
Todd
who
isn't
familiar
with
the
area
drove
to
a
friend's
house
and
together
the
pair
located
the
Citizens
Bank
ATM
at
Liberty
and
Pearl
where
the
attack
happened
and
called
police
Via

Charlie

both

The

and
Ashley
called
the

at
9:30
PM
ET
Initially
she
was
robbed
ran
away
after
the
robbery
and
the
robber
followed
her
to
her
car
At
that
point
he
became
enraged
at
the
bumper
sticker
and
began
beating
her
and
scratched
the
B
into
her
face
Ashley
went

after
initially
refusing
medical
attention
last
night
and
had

Eilon
spoke

She

She

Both
Eilon
and
Smith
expressed
revulsion
over
an
attack
on
a
young
woman
just
getting
involved
in
politics
but
they
consider
this
the
act
of
a
lone
lunatic

About
Time
Gingrich
compares
MSM
to
Pravda
and
Communists
I
must
say
I've
never
heard
Gingrich
come
out
so
forcefully
against
Big
Media
This
is
so
true
and
so
spot
on
but
I
admit
that
I
was
surprised
at
the
forcefulness
of
his
argument
Via

Hoft

I

HUGE--Obama
Campaign
Nabbed
Committing
Web-Based

Whoa
Obama
is
redistributing
wealth
already--to
himself
No
wonder
he's
raised
so
much
money
despite
the

have
being
so
tight
THIS
IS
CRIMINAL
PROSECUTABLE
The

Ace

forgive
me
for

this

it

will
have

there

NOTING
FICTITIOUS
CONTRIBUTORS
This
story
is
getting
some
notice
Mark
Steyn
cautions
though
Stop
donating
just
to
test
it
out
It's
clear
it's
deliberately
set
up
to
facilitate
campaign
donation
fraud
from
both
people
going
over
the
limit
and
of
course
Saudis
Pakistanis
and
Gazans
donating
illegally
Testing
it
at
this
point
just
puts
more
money
in
this
cocksucker's
pocket
Hot
Air
too
Draw
up
the
impeachment
papers
If
Obama
wins
we
should
be
ready
This
is
the
deliberate
evasion
of
campaign
finance
rules
It's
shocking
the
media
never
checked
before
and
apparently
isn't
even
checking
now
Note
This
is
quite
deliberate
The
Address
Verification
System
has
to
be
specifically
disabled
to
allow
this
fraud
Having
worked
for
companies
that
process
credit
cards
online
it
is
necessary
to
go
through
and
manually
disable
the
safeguards
that
they
put
in
place
to
verify
a
person's
address
and
zip
code
with
the
cardholder's
bank
But
international
banks
don't
currently
have
the
same
safeguards
that
banks
in
the
US
have
which
also
works
in
the
One's
favor
So
most
likely
they've
disabled
the
necessary
safeguards
for
US
cards
which
their
merchant
bank
would
be
angry
about
if
they
found
out
since
it
exposes
them
to
risk
as
well
as
international
cards
which
is
an
even
greater
risk
because
there's
no
way
to
verify
the
information
electronically
for
most
countries
so
they
could
just
say
they're
in
the
US
with
phony
info
and
the
card
will
still
process
online
The
One
could
then
just
claim
that
they
said
they
were
from
America
Senator
Clinton's
website
worked
with
a
reputable
company
that
had
the
same
safeguards
in
place
for
her
online
donations
seems
like
someone
just
doesn't
like
to
play
by
the
rules
that
credit
card
companies
have
put
in
place
What
if
for
some
kooky
reason
their
off
the
rack
software
didn't
have
this
most
basic
check
available
They
could
easily
do
that
through
the
coding
on
their
website
and
an
organization
like
a
campaign
would
have
the
resources
to
do
it
If
I
had
to
guess
it
would
probably
cost
200-400
dollars
to
get
a
programmer
to
add
that
functionality
to
a
payment
gateway
if
their
system
didn't
have
that
in
place
already
But
then
you
can't
have
someone
donating
millions
of
dollars
in
100
dollar
increments
under
different
names
and
we
can't
have
that
now
can
we
Huusker
explains
the
system
that
Obama
disabled
Intentionally
It's
called
the
Address
Verification
System
AVS
When
you
submit
a
credit
card
to
the
processor
for
authorization
you
get
back
one
of
four
responses
zipcode
match
address
match
both
match
or
neither
match
AVS
is
automatic
and
can't
be
turned
off
You
can
however
override
it
in
special
circumstances
It
looks
like
Obama's
web
site
has
the
AVS-override
turned
on
permanently
Is
there
any
legitimate
reason
to
do
this
No
Visa/MC
banks
hate
it
when
merchants
blow
off
AVS
as
it
increases
the
risk
of
chargebacks
which
are
a
hassle/expense
for
the
bank
to
handle
Consequently
they
demand
a
much
higher
discount
rate
to
take
cards
with
AVS-overrides
If
a
merchant's
chargeback
rate
goes
above
1
the
banks
will
wallop
the
merchant
with
research
fees
Merchants
with
high
chargeback
rates
like
porn
sites
can
end
up
paying
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
extra
monthly
fees
in
order
to
be
able
to
continue
to
accept
cards
on
top
of
huge
discounts
on
each
transaction
But
Obama
isn't
getting
many
complaints
because
those
donating
illegally
are
of
course
winking
coconspirators
in
the
scam
They're
certainly
not
demanding
the
banks
reimburse
them
so
no
one
is
the
wiser

figure

its

Courtesy
of

this

The
listed

wasn't
even
close
to
my
real

While
I
hate
to
think
I'm
giving
any
money
at
all
to
these
bastards
its
worth
it
to
prove
once

for

that
they
are

will
verify

my

say
again
Try
entering
false

when
ordering

You

And
yet
Barack
Obama
has
overridden
this
basic
security
feature
in
order
to
allow
the
world
to
donate
to
him
and
to
rack
up
millions

millions
in
illegal
over-the-limit
donations

didn't

for

or
even
a

from

Hillary

did
of
course
Because
they
were
interested
in
following
the
law
Obama
wasn't
He
didn't
even
bother
alerting
foreign

that
it
was

them
to

Wink
TIP
From
an
anonymous
source
with
very
good
access
to
what's
going
on
The
media
refuses
to
do
anything
with
this
because
despite
all
the
reports
of
Good
Will
and
asdf
and
other
clearly
fake
names
such
previously
donating
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
the
campaign
they
refuse
to
acknowledge
that
any
of
these
donations
are
fraudulent
in
the
first
place
So
getting
to
the
second
point
that
Obama's
site
has
been
deliberately
crippled
to
switch
off
the
most
basic
address
verification
check
is
impossible
They
insist
this
is
all
on
the
level
and
each
and
every
one
of
Obama's
donors
is
real
Including
Good
Will
occupation
Loving
You
asdf
Mickey
Mouse
and
now

Hank
Rearden

and

Despite
the
fact
that
this
has
all
already
been
exposed
by
no
lesser
Obama
Campaign
Organ
than
the
New

Times

Gee
I
wonder
why
everyone
is
so
convinced
that
a
single-digit
race
is
all
over
The
media
coverage
of
the
race
for
president
has
not
so
much
cast
Barack
Obama
in
a
favorable
light
as
it
has
portrayed
John
McCain
in
a
substantially
negative
one
according
to
a
new
study
of
the
media
since
the
two
national
political
conventions
ended
Press
treatment
of
Obama
has
been
somewhat
more
positive
than
negative
but
not
markedly
so
But
coverage
of
McCain
has
been
heavily
unfavorable
and
has
become
more
so
over
time
In
the
six
weeks
following
the
conventions
through
the
final
debate
unfavorable
stories
about
McCain
outweighed
favorable
ones
by
a
factor
of
more
than
three-to-one
the
most
unfavorable
of
all
four
candidates
according
to
the
study
by
the
Pew
Research
Center's
Project
for
Excellence
in
Journalism
Who
knew
Not
only
that
but
for
all
of
the
ridiculous
yes
I
said
ridiculous...and
I
mean
ri-diculous
speculation
that
Sarah
Palin
is
actually
a
drag
on
the
McCain
ticket
Glenn
Reynolds
demonstrates
that
Joe
Biden
is
not
exactly
feeling
the
love
from
the
top
of
his
ticket
WHO'S
HIDING
NOW
It
might
be
surprising
to
some
to
learn
that
Sarah
Palin
is
now
talking
to
her
national
press
corps
more
often
than
Joe
Biden
While
the
once
silent
Palin
has
taken
questions
from
reporters
that
travel
with
her
three
times
in
the
last
week
Biden
has
not
offered
the
same
type
of
access
to
reporters
who
cover
his
every
move
on
the
campaign
trail
in
almost
two
months
Plus
this
Biden
has
also
not
taken
questions
from
voters
in
a
town
hall
style
setting
since
Sept
10
in
Nashua
New
Hampshire
when
he
told
a
supporter
that
Hillary
Clinton
might
have
been
a
better
pick
for
vice
president

would
be
tested
by
an
international
crisis
within
his
first
six
months
in

focusing
instead
on
criticizing
Sen
John

It
sounds
like
the
press
is
getting
a
bit
testy
about
the
cocooning
here
Listen
folks
it
is
pretty
damn
simple
they
are
trying

convince
you
that
it
is
over
It
isn't
They
are
lying
they
are
trying
to
keep
you
home
if
you
intend
to
vote
for
McCain
They
are
working
with
the
Democrats
to
FIX
this
election
as
they
have
been
doing
all
year
It
is
FAR
from
over
Don't
wait
for
election
day
when
all
the
thugs
will
be
out
go
do
your
duty
to
save
OUR

from

this

Why
are

still

to

This

This

Optimism
for
Right-leaning
Blogs
Glenn
found
this
today
Probably
very
good
advice
Would
you
want
to
be
a
blogger
much
less
a
how
shall
I
put
it
right-wing
blogger
after
the
revolution
Of
course
you
would
There
would
be
nothing
cooler
funner
or
for
most
of
us
nothing
that
would
be
a
better
way
to
participate
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
and
perhaps
make
a
difference
in
opposition
to
what
could
be
the
most
left-wing
administration
in
history
The
frisson
of
danger
only
makes
it
ginchier
because
in
fact
as
conservatives
we
have
confidence
in
our
Constitution
and
fundamentally
the
institutions
that
make
it
work
and
survive
notwithstanding
our
frequent
disappointments
Unlike
left-wing
crybabies
who
threaten
always
with
no
intention
to
follow
through
to
run
for
friendlier
peoples
paradises
if
this
or
that
Republican
is
elected
we
are
here
we
aren't
going
anywhere
and
we
aren't
trading
in
our
bloggin
pajamas
until
they
blade
it
off
our
cold
green
corpses
Good
Now
what
are
you
going
to
do
make
sure
it
never
comes
to
that
Now
given
your
faith
in
the

how
are
you
going

act
to

I
may
use
the

I

in

The
MBA
is
to
some
extent
the
institutionalization
of
a
dynamic
that
is
anathema
to
many
bloggers
Joining
organizations
agreeing
to
standards
not
standardization
bestowing
a
limited
quantum
of
representative
proxy
and
interacting
cooperatively
with
people
like
the
MSM
the
courts
and
others
whom
many
bloggers
consider
sacred
cows
There
will
always
be
the
ACLU
the
EFF
and
many
fine
organizations
not
all
of
which
are
conservatives
first
choice
of
whom
they'd
want
to
call
in
an
emergency
and
individuals
who
are
out
there
fighting
the
good
fight
But
right
now
the
MBA
is
the
only
grouping
of
bloggers
across
the
spectrum
that
is
in
a
position
and
is
formed
for
the
sole
purpose
of
protecting
the
rights
bloggers
have
to
the
full
extent
of
the
law
to
express
themselves
in
their
chosen
medium
to
the
full
extent
of
their
constitutional
rights
to
do
so
If
you're
as
afraid
of
an
Obama
Administration
and
how
it
might
go
for
bloggers
as
some
of
you
say
you
are
which
is
a
lot
more
afraid
than
I
am
notwithstanding
the
scare
links
in
my
first
paragraph
you'll
consider
joining
the
MBA
or
perhaps
replicating
what
it
has
done
in
a
manner
consistent
with
your
own
tastes
while
you
can
If
you're
not
afraid
but
like
me
you
have
your
concerns
there's
no
rush
But
you
should
check
us
out
Just
in
case.My
fears
about
all
this
are
not
completely
mollified
I
think
a
Pelosi
led
supermajority
will
try
to
muzzle
every
single
bit
of
dissent
that
it
can
get
its
tyrannical
hands
on
Still
I
probably
will
take
a
bit
of
a
break
after
the
election
anyway
especially
if
Obam-munism
wins
not
out
of
fear
but
out
of
sheer
frustration
and
a
need
to
recharge
the
batteries
But
I
am
sure
I
won't
be
able
to
stay
away
for
too
long

UPDATED
A
Plea
to
my
fellow
Citizens
Why
Obama
Should
NOT
be
President
now
or
ever
UPDATE
Edited
for
clarity
and
grammar
OK
for
whatever
reason
I
feel
another
vent
coming
on
so
buckle
your
belts
I
am
going
to
let
it
fly
Mary
Katherine
Ham
and
Guy
Benson
with
help
from
Ed
Morrissey
have
assembled
a
spectacular
montage
of
videos
mostly
of
Obama's
own
words
broken
down
by
category
and
issues
This
is
one
of
the
most
impressive
comprehensive
arguments
I
have
ever
seen
in
any
campaign
ever
And
it
is
DEVASTATING
They
have
obviously
spent
a
lot
of
time
putting
all
this
together
and
it
is
quite
extensive
I
agree
with
Uncle
Jimbo
at
Blackfive
when
he
suggests
that
if
Big
media
had
done
the
job
it
is
supposed
to
do
and
had
actually
tried
to
remain
objective
for
American
elections
had
it
done
a
thorough
job
in
vetting
BOTH
candidates
then
Obama
would
be
likely
be
facing
a
landslide
loss
And
is
objectivity
not
after
all
what
we
have
always
been
told
was
the
legitimate
role
of
the
free
press
in
a
free
democracy
Here
is
a
Cynical
Lesson
if
you
can
just
appear
cool
calm
and
collected--no
matter
how
radical
totalitarian
despotic
Marxist
and
sociopathic
your
actual
words
and
beliefs
may
be--many
Americans
can
be
tricked
hypnotized
bamboozled
to
cast
their
vote
for
you
Glibness
trumps
Intelligence
every
time
Obviously
as
even
Sarah
Palin
has
proven
by
her
astounding
SNL
numbers
being
telegenic
has
become
a
more
important
factor
for
an
American
election
than
what
candidates
actually
stand
for
certainly
it
is
the
prime
factor
to
many
otherwise
intelligent
and
good-natured
people
Of
course
the
media
counts
on
this
inability
to
discern
truth
As
I
have
thought
from
the
beginning
of
this
long
campaign
this
tendency
argumes
that
Republicans
would
have
been
far
better
off
with
a
Romney
a
Gingrich
a
Thompson
even
a
Giulianni--than
with
the
less
telegenic
McCain
despite
his
many
years
of
dedication
and
service
Because--you
see--things
like
character
and
honesty
no
longer
matter
to
most
Americans
These
days
it's
just
about
whether
you
look
good
on
The
View
or
Oprah
But
even
given
this
tragic
fact
of
life
in
our
culture
I
remain
convinced
that
if
these
two
candidates
had
been
truly
vetted
by
its
own
media
mouthpieces
we
would
not
have
reached
the
stage
of
crisis
where
we
are
today--poised
to
elect
a
telegenic
smooth-talking
Marxist
nightmare
Even
posts
like
this--assuming
people
would
actually
follow
the
clips
and
links
above
and
view
this
compilation
of
OBAMA'S
OWN
VIDEO
CLIPS--could
help
I
am
convinced
the
polls
would
be
vastly
different
than
we
are
seeing--even
given
that
the
current
polls
are
heavily
weighted
to
a
Democrat
bias--if
only
the
people
knew
what
Obama
was
really
about
If
the
seditious
news
media
actually
cared
more
about
its
role
in
ensuring
the
proper
function
of
American
democracy
if
the
media
had
not
so
disastrously
dropped
the
ball
if
it
had
provided
to
the
electorate
all
the
information
it
needed
rather
than
to
decide
that
IT
not
the
American
people
should
influence
and
determine
the
results
of
elections--well
then
even
a
telegenic
and
cool
character
like
Obama
would
not
stand
a
snowball's
chance
in
hell
given
his
predisposition
to
lie
on
demand
In
my
view
Barack
Obama
is
a
greater
danger
to
America
and
to
what
made
us
great--to
what
made
us
the
most
wealthy
generous
self-sacrificing
and
egalitarian
society
in
human
history
to
the
Constitution
that
men
died
for
that
gave
us
the
freedoms
we
take
for
granted
to
the
jobs
we
take
for
granted
to
the
LIFE
we
take
for
granted--than
Al
Qaeda
ever
will
be
If
we
elect
this
man
I
am
convinced
that
history
will
bear
me
out
on
this
But
here
is
the
good
news
It
is
not
too
late
to
prevent
an
unimaginable
catastrophe
not
only
for
Americans
but
for
the
hopes
of
freedom
the
poor
and
the
oppressed
throughout
the
world
Here
is
my
plea--If
you
are
even
thinking
about
voting
for
Obama
first
do
just
this
Read
the
whole
thing
watch
every
video
Then
go
read
this
and
this
again
Go
read
THIS--all
of
it--BOTH
parts
And
then
sit
there
and
try
and
tell
me
with
a
straight
face
why
anyone
who
is
not
insane
should
cast
a
vote
for
this
man
And
yes
I
am
saying
exactly
what
I
think
and
exactly
how
I
feel
about
this
man
and
how
dangerous
a
Democrat
sweep
would
be
to
everything
we
care
about
Because
if
I
don't
say
it
now
I
may
very
well
lose
the
right
to
even
speak
up
at
all
after
the
election
I
truly
do
not
believe
this
to
be
hyperbole
or
an
exaggeration
you
need
only
look
at
the
lengths
Obama's
campaign
and
his
willing
sycophants
in
Big
Media
have
gone
to
in
order
to
smear
and
destroy
the
lives
of
decent
average
Americans
like
Joe
the
Plumber
to
get
a
clear
and
disturbing
preminition
of
at
what
Obama
and
the
hard-Lefites
in
Congress
might
try
actually
try
to
do
to
dissent
with
the
full
powers
of
the
Presidency
Hell
I
think
Stalin
probably
took
criticism
better
than
this
guy
does
The
thought
of
this
man
as
Commander
and
Chief
is
more
horrifying
to
me
than
was
watching
those
planes
hit
the
WTC
We
are
under
attack
Only
it
is
the
worst
kind
of
attack
it
is
like
HIV
a
hidden
virulent
insidious
betrayal
of
our
core
principles
from
within
The
previously
healthy
white
blood
cells
of
our
society
have
been
tricked
by
a
corrupt
decrepit
monstrous
philosophy--disguised
as
an
easy
way
out
for
the
terminally
lazy
We
might
as
well
be
living
Christmas
Eve
1776
And
like
Washington's
Army
camped
across
the
Delaware
River
in
the
cold
and
fog
about
to
embark
on
a
raid
that
would
change
history--we
still
have
a
glimmer
of
hope
today
But
hope
is
not
enough
It
is
time
to
ACT
No
matter
how
hard
it
is
to
do
no
matter
how
it
may
turn
your
stomach
go
cast
your
vote
TODAY
for
John
McCain
Sarah
Palin
and
every
Republican
Senator
Congressman
Judge
and
City
Council
member
on
your
ballot
It
is
time
for
those
who
love
this
country
to
again
cross
the
Delaware
Otherwise
the
very
idea
of
preserving
protecting
and
defending
the
Constitution
the
United
States
of
America
could
all
be
gone
poof
just
like
that
And
the
sequence
of
events
that
initiated
the
downfall
of
this
magnificent
country
will
have
reached
critical
mass
on
YOUR
watch
The
shame
will
not
be
mine--it
will
be
YOURS
and
it
will
be
triggered
by
the
blind
obedience
to
the
suggestions
of
the
self-important
corrupted
media
you
so
foolishly
followed
off
the
cliff
like
sheep
If
you
vote
for
Barack
Obama
if
you
actually
took
the
trouble
read
and
view
all
this
information
followed
all
the
links
and
watched
all
the
videos
and
yet
can
still
somehow
in
your
twisted
mind
justify
voting
for
this
man
then
you
will
have
to
live
for
the
rest
of
your
life
with
the
consequences
of
your
choice
If
you
have
any
conscience
at
all
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
Justice
or
Karma
the
decision
to
help
this
man
to
steal
our
country
out
from
under
us
will
haunt
you
for
the
rest
of
your
natural
lives
And
it
will
be
punishment
well
deserved
It
doesn't
have
to
be
this
way
Please
don't
kill
our
country
There
is
still
time

The
Manifesto
of
the
SILENCED
Majority
I
hope
that
Doug
Ross
will
forgive
me
for
posting
his
absolutely
brilliant
list
of
points
here
in
their
entireity
Personally
I
think
this
thing
needs
to
go
viral
as
soon
as
possible
The
Manifesto
of
the
Silenced
Majority
We
believe
that
Barack
Obama
is
a
brilliant
orator
and
a
man
possessed
of
more
charisma
than
any
politician
since
JFK
But
we
also
believe
that
his
philosophy
of
spreading
the
wealth
around
is
an
ill-disguised
form
of
socialism
that
undermines
everything
America
holds
dear
We
believe
that
a
tax
cut
on
95
of
working
Americans
when
only
63
of
Americans
pay
taxes
is
nonsensical
We
believe
that
the
Obama
campaign's
obfuscated
funding
for
ACORN
originally
described
as
event
planning
undermines
the
integrity
of
our
elections
and
calls
into
question
the
legality
of
his
tactics
We
believe
that
Barack
Obama's
plan
to
form
a
civilian
national
security
force
that's
just
as
powerful
just
as
strong
just
as
well-funded
as
our
military
is
ill-considered
at
best
We
believe
that
the
Obama
campaign's
efforts
to
intimidate
WGN
on
two
separate
occasions
when
it
interviewed
his
political
foes
endangers
free
speech
We
believe
that
Obama's
choice
of
Joe
Biden
as
VP
runs
counter
to
his
twin
aspirations
of
hope
and
change
We
believe
that
a
man
who
could
not
otherwise
receive
a
security
clearance
should
not
serve
as
Commander-in-Chief
We
believe
that
Obama's
20-year
relationship
with
his
pastor
who
he
once
described
as
his
spiritual
adviser
displays
a
basic
affinity
for
a
racist
ideology
that
runs
counter
to
everything
his
candidacy
should
stand
for
We
believe
that
most
of
Obama's
senate
experience
has
been
spent
running
for
office
from
the
time
he
was
sworn
in
as
a
U.S
senator
to
the
time
he
formed
a
presidential
exploratory
committee
he
logged
only
143
days
in
the
senate
We
believe
that
Obama
does
voters
a
disservice
by
hiding
his
chairmanship
of
the
Chicago
Annenberg
Challenge
a
165
million
dollar
effort
to
improve
Chicago's
schools
when
he
used
that
service
as
his
central
experience
in
2000
during
his
first
run
for
Congress
We
believe
that
Obama
made
a
series
of
very
poor
choices
by
serving
on
boards
and
sharing
an
office
with
Bill
Ayers
for
three
years
Ayers
organization
killed
three
police
officers
bombed
numerous
government
facilities
and
nearly
detonated
a
nail
bomb
at
a
Fort
Dix
Officer's
Dance
We
believe
that
no
matter
Obama's
relationship
with
Bill
Ayers
his
evasive
and
ever-morphing
answers
about
their
work
together
smack
of
a
coverup
We
believe
that
anyone
no
matter
their
position
on
abortion
who
supports
killing
an
infant
that
survived
a
botched
abortion
is
on
the
wrong
side
of
any
moral
code
We
believe
that
Obama's
advisers
and
contributors
from
Tony
Rezko
to
Valerie
Jarrett
to
Allison
Davis
cost
taxpayers
millions
in
development
fees
for
failed
and
often
uninhabitable
apartment
complexes
We
believe
that
Obama's
Illinois
state
senate
experience
was
insubstantial
it
was
by
his
own
description
a
part-time
position
and
he
maintained
two
offices
one
at
the
state
senate
and
one
at
his
law
firm
We
believe
that
Obama's
state
senatorial
experience
was
further
diluted
by
his
129
present
votes
which
as
NPR
observes
There's
a
saying
in
Springfield
that
there's
a
reason
why
the
present
button
is
yellow
but
I
don't
think
that
Barack
Obama
was
necessarily
a
coward
for
voting
present
on
those
bills
We
also
believe
that
Obama's
experience
as
a
community
organizer
and
as
a
trainer
for
ACORN
are
not
qualifications
for
the
presidency
We
believe
that
the
candidate
has
not
been
forthcoming
with
his
background
and
the
key
influencing
forces
during
his
formative
years
We
therefore
believe
that
Barack
Obama
is
ill-prepared
and
ill-suited
for
the
Presidency

OF
THE
DAY
Tito
Munoz
and
An
Army
of
Joes
The
pen
may
indeed
be
mightier
than
the
sword
but
Byron
York's
laptop
is
dripping
pure
gold
tonight
However
the
gold
mine
is
a
man
named
Tito
Munoz
a
legal
immigrant
construction
worker
attending
a
Woodbridge
Virginia
McCain
rally
If
you
read
anything
today
read
this
one
because
it
provides
a
pulse--a
steady
beat
of
something
that
is
only
now
bubbling
to
the
surface
thanks
to
a
plumber
named
Joe
thanks
to
a
Presidential
candidate
who
can't
hide
his
Marxist
tendencies
and
thanks
to
journalists
like
David
Corn
who
just
can't
help
themselves
from
stepping
in
it
Only
this
time
it's
like
adding
gasoline
to
a
flame
As
the
people
here
in
Woodbridge
saw
it
Joe
was
a
guy
who
asked
Barack
Obama
an
inconvenient
question
and
for
his
troubles
suddenly
found
himself
under
investigation
by
the
media
In
the
audience
Saturday
there
were
plenty
of
people
who
were
mad
about
it
There
was
real
anger
at
this
rally
but
it
wasn't
as
some
erroneous
press
reports
from
other
McCain
rallies
have
suggested
aimed
at
Obama
It
was
aimed
at
the
press
And
that's
where
Tito
Munoz
came
in
After
McCain
left
as
the
crowd
filed
out
Munoz
made
his
way
to
an
area
near
some
loudspeakers
He
attracted
a
few
reporters
when
he
started
talking
loudly
in
heavily-accented
English
about
media
mistreatment
of
Wurzelbacher
It
was
clear
that
Spanish
was
Munoz's
native
language
and
he
later
told
me
he
was
born
in
Colombia
When
I
first
made
my
way
over
to
him
Munoz
thought
I
was
there
to
give
him
the
third
degree
Are
you
going
to
check
my
license
too
he
asked
me
Are
you
going
to
check
my
immigration
status
I'm
ready
I
have
everything
here
Whatever
you
want
I
have
it
I
have
my
green
card
I
have
my
passport
I
was
a
little
surprised
Did
Munoz
really
bring
his
papers
with
him
to
a
McCain
rally
I
asked
Yeah
I
have
my
papers
right
here
he
said
I'm
an
American
citizen
Right
here
right
here
With
that
he
produced
a
U.S
passport
turned
it
to
the
page
with
his
picture
on
it
and
thrust
it
about
an
inch
from
my
nose
Right
here
he
said
In
your
face
Munoz
said
he
owned
a
small
construction
business
I
have
a
license
if
you
guys
want
to
check
he
said
Someone
asked
why
Munoz
had
come
to
the
rally
I
support
McCain
but
I've
come
to
face
you
guys
because
I'm
disgusted
with
you
guys
he
said
Why
the
hell
are
you
going
after
Joe
the
Plumber
Joe
the
Plumber
has
an
idea
He
has
a
future
He
wants
to
be
something
else
Why
is
that
wrong
Everything
is
possible
in
America
I
made
it
Joe
the
Plumber
could
make
it
even
better
than
me
I
was
born
in
Colombia
but
I
was
made
in
the
U.S.A
The
scene
turned
into
a
mini-fracas
when
David
Corn
of
Mother
Jones
defended
press
coverage
Munoz
was
having
none
of
it
Why
he
asked
would
the
press
whack
Joe
the
Plumber
when
it
didn't
want
to
report
on
Obama's
relationship
with
William
Ayers
the
former
Weather
Underground
bomber
How
come
that's
not
in
the
news
all
the
time
Munoz
said
How
come
Joe
the
Plumber
is
every
second
I'm
talking
about
NBC
MSNBC
CBS
ABC
and
CNN
A
black
woman
with
a
strong
Caribbean
accent
jumped
in
the
fray
Tell
me
she
said
to
Corn
why
is
it
you
can
go
and
find
out
about
Joe
the
Plumber's
tax
lien
and
when
he
divorced
his
wife
and
you
can't
tell
me
when
Barack
Obama
met
with
William
Ayers
Why
Why
could
you
not
tell
us
that
Joe
the
Plumber
is
me
I
am
Joe
the
Plumber
Munoz
chimed
in
You're
attacking
me
Wait
a
second
Corn
said
Do
you
pay
your
taxes
Yes
I
pay
my
taxes
the
woman
said
Then
you're
better
than
Joe
the
Plumber
Corn
said
That
set
off
a
general
free-for-all
I'm
going
to
tell
you
something
Munoz
yelled
at
Corn
I'm
better
than
Obama
Why
Because
I'm
not
associated
with
terrorists
And
so
it
went
I
walked
away
for
a
few
minutes
to
strike
up
a
conversation
with
the
woman
who
had
jumped
into
the
debate
Her
name
was
Connie
and
she
said
she
had
been
born
and
raised
in
Antigua
in
the
West
Indies
I
immigrated
to
the
United
States
over
20
years
ago
she
told
me
It's
my
home
America
has
become
my
home
I
came
here
freely
of
my
own
free
will
because
I
loved
it
and
I
loved
what
it
had
to
offer
and
I
don't
want
to
see
it
ruined
I
asked
her
whether
it
was
difficult
as
a
black
person
to
support
McCain
at
a
time
when
probably
90
to
95
percent
of
black
voters
support
Obama
I
have
always
been
a
conservative
she
told
me
I'm
mad
I
was
extremely
upset
to
see
the
way
the
media
went
after
Sarah
Palin
and
Joe
the
Plumber
To
see
the
drive-by
media
and
the
Obama
campaign
attack
two
ordinary
Americans
simply
because
one
of
them
managed
to
get
Barack
Obama
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
shameful
and
disgraceful
Meanwhile
the
great
debate
was
continuing
with
Tito
the
Construction
Worker
and
David
the
Journalist
trading
points
Much
of
it
wasn't
terribly
informative
but
there
was
one
lovely
moment
when
a
shouting
match
turned
into
a
lesson
on
the
fundamental
meaning
of
American
constitutional
rights
and
the
immigrant
was
the
teacher
Let
me
talk
Munoz
said
to
Corn
I
know
the
Constitution
and
I
know
my
First
Amendment
I'm
not
the
state
Corn
said
I
can't
take
that
right
away
from
you
No
no
Munoz
shot
back
Even
the
state
the
state
cannot
take
that
right
away
Right
right
Corn
quickly
agreed
Nobody
can
take
that
away
Munoz
said
And
indeed
they
can't
I've
got
news
Joe
the
Plumber
has
hit
a
nerve
and
geiger
counters
are
going
off
all
over
This
thing
isn't

Transformational
Hell
Pol
Pot
was
Transformational
If
this
is
the
transformation
we
are
going
to
get
with
Obama
ah
no
thank
you
via
Roger
Kimball
I
agree
with
Gen
Powell
that
Obama
would
be
a
transformational
figure
But
what
sort
of
transformation
are
we
talking
about
The
United
States
is
the
richest
freest
most
powerful
nation
in
history
What
would
it
look
like
after
Obama
abetted
by
a
Pelosi-Reid
Congress
got
done
with
their
transformation
Yes
that's
right
Virginia
it
would
be
poorer
markedly
less
free
and
less
powerful
How
exactly
In
a
recent
editorial
The
Wall
Street
Journal
toted
up
some
of
the
ways
the
country
would
be
likely
to
change
were
Obama
elected
with
the
expected
left-wing
filibuster-proof
super-majority
Caveat
emptor
this
election
is
no
ordinary
choice-among-basically-similar
political
moderates
It
is
a
choice
between
a
liberal
idiosyncratic
Republican
and
an
activist
left-wing
crusader
As
the
Journal
noted
this
would
be
one
of
the
most
profound
political
and
ideological
shifts
in
U.S
history
Liberals
would
dominate
the
entire
government
in
a
way
they
haven't
since
1965
or
1933
In
other
words
the
election
would
mark
the
restoration
of
the
activist
government
that
fell
out
of
public
favor
in
the
1970s
Some
particulars
On
health
care
you
could
look
forward
to
HillaryCare
with
a
vengeance
Think
socialized
medicine
Worse
care
for
a
higher
price
Think
Canada
6
months
to
schedule
an
operation
more
bureaucracy
worse
nursing
more
incompetent
doctors
On
the
economy
Say
hello
to
more
and
more
onerous
regulation
The
danger
the
Journal
noted
is
that
Democrats
could
cause
the
economic
downturn
to
last
longer
than
it
otherwise
will
by
enacting
regulatory
overkill
like
Sarbanes-Oxley
Something
more
punitive
is
likely
as
well
for
instance
a
windfall
profits
tax
on
oil
and
maybe
other
industries
Unions
Look
for
a
big
resurgence
in
economy-blighting
unions
Taxes
Say
hello
to
taxes
taxes
and
more
taxes
Taxes
according
to
the
Journal
will
rise
substantially
the
only
question
being
how
high
We
know
for
starters
that
Obama
wants
to
raise
The
top
income
tax
rate
Dividend
taxes
Capital
gains
taxes
And
he
wants
to
abolish
the
cap
on
the
money
the
government
takes
from
you
for
Medicare
and
Social
Security
All
of
this
would
not
only
drastically
increase
the
cost
of
new
business
initiatives
in
the
United
States
it
would
also
put
a
huge
burden
on
millions
of
ordinary
taxpayers
Free
speech
Remember
that
We've
already
had
a
taste
of
how
Obama
deals
with
speech
he
doesn't
like
he
tries
to
shut
it
down
When
Stanley
Kurtz
went
on
Milt
Rosenberg's
Extension
720
radio
show
in
Chicago
Obama's
minions
followed
Obama's
order
to
get
in
the
face
of
opponents
and
flooded
the
phone
lines
with
protests
There
have
been
a
lot
of
disgusting
things
about
this
campaign
The
hysterical
attack
on
Sarah
Palin
and
her
family
was
a
new
low
But
for
my
money
the
very
worst
episode
so
far
has
been
the
attack
on
Samuel
Joe
the
Plumber
Wurzelbacher
Joe
asked
Obama
an
embarrassing
question
More
to
the
point
he
elicited
a
momentary
lapse
into
candor
from
Obama
a
moment
moreover
that
was
caught
on
tape
broadcast
and
rebroadcast
and
that
John
McCain
seized
or
at
least
maneuvered
with
rhetorical
paws
in
his
last
debate
with
Obama
It's
not
that
I
want
to
punish
you
for
your
success
Obama
said
it's
just
that
I
want
to
spread
the
wealth
around
Joe
the
Plumber
assumed
that
the
money
he
made
was
his
money
That
was
hist
first
mistake
Obama-Pelosi-Reid
do
not
like
private
property
except
their
own
they
think
the
government
should
take
more
and
more
of
it
and
spread
it
around
Poor
Joe
Talk
about
the
politics
of
personal
destruction
Turns
out
the
Clintons
were
rank
amateurs
at
that
game
The
roof
fell
in
on
Joe
The
Obama
smear
machine
went
to
work
Did
you
know
that
when
he
lived
in
Arizona
in
2000
his
driver's
license
was
suspended
Did
you
know
that
he
isn't
a
licensed
plumber
What
He
works
for
a
licensed
plumber
and
doesn't
need
a
license
for
the
sort
of
residential
work
he
does
Don't
confuse
the
story
Did
you
know
that
he
owes
back
taxes
OK
it's
a
pittance
but
hey
we're
trying
to
assassinate
someone's
character
here
Joe
isn't
running
for
anything
He
is
an
ordinary
working
stiff
He
was
throwing
a
football
around
in
his
yard
with
his
son
when
Obama
walked
by
and
he
took
the
opportunity
to
ask
a
sharp
question
The
candidate
gave
an
answer
that
was
just
a
little
too
candid
Result
Joe
must
be
publicly
pilloried
and
the
focus
must
be
moved
firmly
from
Obama's
answer
to
Joe's
alleged
misdemeanors
A
few
days
ago
Joe
spoke
to
Mike
Huckabee
on
Fox
TV
I
asked
a
question
When
you
can't
ask
a
question
to
your
leaders
anymore
that
gets
scary
That
bothers
me
As
well
it
should
It
should
bother
you
Dear
Reader
too
Voting
Rights
See
Acorn
Think
same-day
ID-free
voter
registration
Can
you
make
an
X
Terrific
here's
a
ballot
In
essence
an
Obama
administration
would
do
for
voter
registration
what
Barney
Frank
and
Fannie
Mae
did
for
the
housing
market
Gall
alert
if
there
were
a
geiger
counter
for
chutzpah
Obama's
reading
would
be
off
the
chart
There
has
been
a
lot
of
damaging
news
about
Acorn's
activities
recently
damaging
I
mean
to
Obama
since
the
organization
is
essentially
a
shill
for
the
left-flank
of
the
Democratic
party
Obama's
response
Ask
that
a
special
prosecutor
investigate
the
McCain
campaign
and
the
Bush
administration
to
discovery
where
these
smears
are
coming
from
Andrew
McCarthy
has
the
whole
sorry
story
here
All
of
this
should
make
me
unhappy
and
it
does
But
I
have
not
yet
despaired
For
one
thing
as
James
Piereson
put
it
in
the
current
Weekly
Standard
It
Ain't
Over
Till
It's
Over
If
you
trust
the
celebrity
buzz
Michelle
should
be
over
at
1600
Pennsylvania
Avenue
right
now
measuring
the
curtains
and
talking
to
the
chef
about
stocking
up
on
lobster
and
caviar
But
the
President
of
the
United
States
is
not
not
yet
appointed
by
acclamation
Even
now
he
is
elected
by
more
or
less
democratic
franchise
And
therein
glows
the
proverbial
silver
lining
As
Piereson
points
out
while
the
buzz
is
Obama-philic
the
polls
tells
a
different
story
and
so
does
history
Yes
Obama
is
ahead
in
the
polls
but
modestly
so
4-7
points
Piereson
reminds
us
of
how
Humphrey
and
Ford
fought
against
much
larger
leads
in
1968
and
1976
and
came
within
an
ace
of
winning
the
White
House
And
even
more
telling
was
the
1948
election
in
which
Thomas
Dewey
was
the
sure
thing
and
Harry
S
Truman
came
from
behind
and
cinched
the
race
Will
McCain
pull
off
a
Truman
surprise
I
hope
so
As
I
say
I
think
Colin
Powell
was
right
to
call
Obama
a
transformational
figure
He
together
with
a
large
left-wing
majority
in
Congress
would
transform
America
from
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
into
another
socialist
swamp
the
land
of
the
taxed
and
the
home
of
regulated
With
a
filibuster-proof
Senate
and
House
supermajority
led
by
Pelosi
Reid
and
the
other
Lefitst
Oligarchs
pulling
his
strings
Soros
Big
Labor
and
the
Green
wackos
Barack
Obama
would
make
Jimmy
Carter
seem
like
Ronald
Reagan
in
comparison
There
is
still
time
to
prevent
a
real-life
catastrophe
if
not
an
existential
crisis
for
the
US--but
not
much
P.S
Joe
Biden
may
have
been
STUPID
today
but
I
think
he
was
absolutely
right
about
how
the
rest
of
the
world
will
view
an
Obama
Presidency
Question
would
Hamas
Ahmadinejad
Hamas
Putin
Khadaffi
Kim
Jong
Il
and
Farrakhan
have
endorsed
Obama
if
he
were
truly
viewed
by
them
as
the
Strong
Horse
You
know
the
answer
they
all
believe
he
is
weak
naive
and
they
know
he
is
the
most
inexperienced
Presidential
candidate
in
US
history

Another
Day
Another
Lie
Proven
Seriously
maybe
we
should
start
a
Lie
of
the
Day
segment
Ed
Morrissey
has
today's
proof
It's
not
the
crime
it's
the
cover-up
In
the
midst
of
Barack
Obama's
continuing
insistence
that
William
Ayers
was
just
some
guy
in
the
neighborhood
and
just
some
guy
on
two
non-profit
boards
with
whom
Obama
worked
for
almost
a
decade
people
asked
why
Obama
then
gave
Ayers
a
promotional
blurb
for
his
book
A
Kind
and
Just
Parent
The
Children
of
Juvenile
Court
Team
Obama
spokesmen
Bill
Burton
and
Robert
Gibbs
categorically
denied
it
Oops
Maybe
it's
another
State
Senator
Barack
Obama
You
know
another
one
who
would
have
worked
closely
enough
with
an
unrepentant
terrorist
to
get
an
advance
look
at
his
new
book
and
to
write
promotional
material
for
its
sales
One
who
partnered
with
Ayers
on
a
multimillion-dollar
school
reform
project
that
ended
up
a
failure
One
who
owed
Ayers
after
the
unrepentant
terrorist
help
launch
his
career
in
a
fundraiser
in
the
Ayers/Dohrn
household
You
know
there
has
to
be
at
least
a
dozen
Barack
Obamas
who
fit
that
description
On
a
more
serious
note
this
wouldn't
be
an
issue
if
the
Obama
campaign
would
stop
lying
about
the
nature
of
his
relationship
with
Ayers
They've
continually
fibbed
about
it
when
the
public
record
is
pretty
clear
that
they
formed
a
political
alliance
meant
to
boost
Obama's
electoral
career
Their
inability
to
be
honest
about
this
relationship
is
what
makes
these
lesser
revelations
more
significant
than

would
have
no
meaning
at
all
absent
the

that
Team

lied
about
it

Sacramento

post
Sunday
October
19
Filed
by
Mark
Williams
in
Raton
New
Mexico
with
the
Stop
Obama
Tour
We
learned
at
this
morning's
Stop
Obama
Rally
here
that
the
McCain/Palin
Straight
Talk
Express
came
through
town
yesterday
It
arrived
with
a
window
shattered
by
a
22
caliber
weapon
It
had
also
been
hit
by
an
unknown
number
of
paint
balls
from
a
paint
ball
gun
or
guns
There
were
reportedly
no
injuries
and
neither
candidate
was
on
board
One
local
man
who
saw
the
damage
and
spoke
with
the
McCain/Palin
staffers
said
the
attack(s
had
occured
in
southern
New
Mexico
that
same
day
The
Express
is
traveling
the
country
independent
of
the
candidates
handing
out
campaign
materials
Sarah
Palin
is
stumping
in
of
all
places
Roswell
New
Mexico
today
and
then
roughly
back
the
way
we
came
with
an
event
at
the
Henderson
Nevada
Pavilion
tomorrow
and
a
stop
in
Elko
Nevada.AND...LAST
BUT
NOT
LEAST
drum
roll
we
have
Joe
Biden
stating
the
obvious
my
paraphrase
not
only
do
Republicans
see
Obama
as
a
weak-kneed
wimp
on
Foreign
Policy--so
would
our
enemies--AND
SOON
Biden's
actual
quote
in
red
Jennifer
the
presumptive
vice-messiah's
comments
at
a
Seattle
fundraiser
he
apparently
didn't
realize
that
journalists
were
present
are
very
very
interesting
I
think
that
Biden
actually
said
more
than
a
lot
of
people
think
he
said
It
will
not
be
six
months
before
the
world
tests
Barack
Obama
like
they
did
John
Kennedy
The
world
is
lookingWatch
we're
gonna
have
an
international
crisis
a
generated
crisis
to
test
the
mettle
of
this
guy
It
is
rather
unwise
to
air
such
predictions
about
your
running
mate's
presidency
two
weeks
before
the
election
but
that's
what
you
get
when
you
bring
Joe
Biden
onto
the
campaign
Lawyers
call
this
assuming
the
risk
The
really
interesting
part
is
what
followed
I
can
give
you
at
least
four
or
five
scenarios
from
where
it
might
originate
And
he's
gonna
need
help
And
the
kind
of
help
he's
gonna
need
is
he's
gonna
need
you
not
financially
to
help
him
we're
gonna
need
you
to
use
your
influence
your
influence
within
the
community
to
stand
with
him
Because
it's
not
gonna
be
apparent
initially
it's
not
gonna
be
apparent
that
we're
right
Oh
well
THAT's
a
relief
Pollack
continues
Biden
is
saying
two
things
about
an
Obama
presidency
first
that
Obama
will
be
tested
by
America's
rivals
and
second
that
Obama's
response
to
such
a
test
will
likely
be
unpopular
with
the
American
people
Presumably
Biden
does
not
believe
that
the
reason
for
that
unpopularity
will
be
because
Obama
is
too
decisive
or
too
tough
with
our
enemies
it
will
be
because
Obama
is
perceived
as
too
soft
and
indecisive
in
a
crisis
This
is
the
moment
when
Biden
is
asking
Obama
supporters
to
stand
with
him
even
if
he
appears
to
be
channeling
Jimmy
Carter
Biden
says
that
it
will
not
be
apparent
initially
that
we're
right
But
does
he
think
that
the
passage
of
time
has
vindicated
Jimmy
Carter
This
guy
is
a
Gaffe
GOD
With
Biden
providing
at
least
2-3
of
these
per
week
who
needs
campaign
cash
No
wonder
they
are
putting
the
Cone
of
Silence
increasingly
around
both
Obama
and
Biden
Is
NO
ONE
paying
attention
UPDATE
Based
on
user
comments
I
have
added
a
link
to
this
update
BY
Williams
of
his
OWN
story
which
I
did
accurately
quote
see
previous
link
emphasis
below
is
mine
I
spoke
with
the
Secret
Service
agent
in
charge
of
the
investigation
They
cannot
confirm
the
citizen
report
of
gunfire
hitting
the
McCain
bus
McCain
was
not
on
board
although
I
seriously
doubt
that
they
would
advertise
it
if
true
Given
the
current
volatile
atmosphere
of
hate
and
division
being
stirred
and
exploited
by
the
unholy
Left
I
would
expect
that
such
an
incident
would
not
exactly
be
reported
in
a
press
release
That
said
we
have
a
good
relationship
with
the
Men
in
Black
including
an
off
the
record
relationship
with
some
and
I
am
not
inclined
to
question
their
word
Since
first
reporting
the
citizen
account
I
and
others
have
been
busy
chasing
the
story
down
and
so
far
have
not
been
able
to
debunk
or
confirm
the
story
Several
bloggers
and
one
traditional
media
have
also
been
chasing
the
story
down
and
have
come
up
empty
The
real
story
emerging
here
is
in
the
comment
sections
following
the
orginial
story
and
follow
ups
both
on
this
site
and
at
MarkTalk
Some
of
the
comments
that
make
it
through
moderation
are
bad
enough
but
those
that
do
not
make
it
are
terrifying
My
original
report
has
brought
out
the
Radical
Left
Thugs
and
exposed
the
domestic
insurgency
for
what
it
is
While
there
have
been
some
vile
and
racist
comments
directed
at
Obama
they
are
out
numbered
5-1
by
bile
spewing
Leftists
vomiting
hate
for
America
and
her
people
Denigration
of
John
McCain
and
his
service
are
the
least
of
the
offensive
posts
and
the
Obamaites
are
doing
their
best
to
live
up
to
Obama's
religious
mentor
Rev
Wright
and
damning
America
Thank
you
to
all
of
the
concerned
true
Americans
who
have
taken
it
upon
themselves
to
follow
up
on
this
story
and
who
have
tired
to
ferret
out
more
As
I
say
on
the
radio
when
stories
are
breaking
you
are
our
best
eyes
and
ears
The
Mainstream
Media
have
proven
themselves
an
adjunct
to
the
Obama
campaign
and
cannot
be
trusted

Interesting
Video
on
the
subject
Is
Obama
Eligible
to
become
President
We've
discussed
this
rumor
at
least
once
already
and
I
would
guess
that
the
chances
that
a
Federal
Judge
in
Philly
would
dismiss
this
case
are
pretty
high
although
the
lawyer
promises
appeals
BUT
it
is
a
quite
interesting
case
nevertheless
It
may
not
matter
what
does
matter
when
it
comes
to
our
Constitution
these
days
but
count
me
in
among
the
believers
Nutty
Read
on
The
most
interesting
aspect
to
me
is
this
presumably
Obama
could
easily
prove
this
speculation
to
be
false
simply
by
providing
a
legitimate
birth
certificate
and
also
official
records
from
his
days
in
Indonesia
or
the
documents
when
he
returned
to
the
US
The
reason
I
believe
the
sensational
charges
ARE
true
is
simple
why
wouldn't
Obama
simply
produce
the
documents
which
he
claims
would
exhonerate
him
from
these
allegations--that
is
unless
he
had
something
to
hide
Obama
has
not
produced
birth
certificates
medical
records
OR
his
college
records
Again
why
not
Obama's
decision
to
litigate
this
case
instead
of
merely
providing
a
legitimate
birth
certificate
etc
is
evidence
enough
for
me
Why
would
he
and/or
the
Dems
go
to
that
expense
And
the
fact
that
DNC
dollars
are
being
spent
on
this
case
is
even
more
fishy
why
drain
DNC
funds
to
defend
this
in
an
Election
Year
when
all
Obama
has
to
do
to
make
this
go
away
for
good
is
to
provide
documents
proving
he
is
an
American
citizen
Unless...he
isn't
Like
I
said
I
don't
consider
the
chances
of
this
legal
action
being
successful
to
be
very
high
although
if
it
happens
before
the
election
it
could
pave
the
way
for
Hillary--she
certainly
would
mollify
all
those
Dems
and
Independents
who
still
rightly
do
not
trust
Obama
or
have
doubts
about
him
If
the
first
judge
throws
it
out
and
the
Circuit
Court
refuses
Cert
then
it
would
be
extraordinary
for
the
USSC
to
take
this
up
especially
after
what
happened
in
Florida
in
2000
Still
I
do
think
there
is
something
to
these
charges
simply
because
Obama
could
easily
end
all
this
nuttiness
and
EXPENSES
just
by
coughing
up
all
the
documents
that
support
his
case
McCain
has
provided
all
of
the
above
despite
his
being
born
in
a
US
territory
Panama)--a
fact
that
the
Democrats
tried
earlier
in
the
year
to
litigate
Obama
really
does
not
need
all
this
distraction
when
he
can
easily
produce
the
documents
that
is
unless
he
can't...or
unless
there
is
something
in
them
he
very
much
wants
to
keep
hidden
That
is
what
I
believe
to
be
the
case

what
the

Those

about
all

come
up
against
the
kind
of

by
Camp
Obama
charted
here
by
Michael
Barone
Stanley
Kurtz
appeared
on
Milt
Rosenberg's
WGN
radio
program
in
Chicago
Mr
Kurtz
had
been
researching
Mr
Obama's
relationship
with
unrepentant
Weather
Underground
terrorist
William
Ayers
in
Chicago
Annenberg
Challenge
papers
in
the
Richard
J
Daley
Library
in
Chicago
papers
that
were
closed
off
to
him
for
some
days
apparently
at
the
behest
of
Obama
supporters
Obama
fans
jammed
WGN's
phone
lines
and
sent
in
hundreds
of
protest
e-mails
The
message
was
clear
to
anyone
who
would
follow
Mr
Rosenberg's
example
We
will
make
trouble
for
you
if
you
let
anyone
make
the
case
against
The
One
Other
Obama
supporters
have
threatened
critics
with
criminal
prosecution
In
September
St
Louis
County
Circuit
Attorney
Bob
McCulloch
and
St
Louis
City
Circuit
Attorney
Jennifer
Joyce
warned
citizens
that
they
would
bring
criminal
libel
prosecutions
against
anyone
who
made
statements
against
Mr
Obama
that
were
false
I
had
been
under
the
impression
that
the
Alien
and
Sedition
Acts
had
gone
out
of
existence
in
1801-'02
Not
so
apparently
in
metropolitan
St
Louis
Similarly
the
Obama
campaign
called
for
a
criminal
investigation
of
the
American
Issues
Project
when
it
ran
ads
highlighting
Mr
Obama's
ties
to
Mr
Ayers
No
such
threats
of
course
will
be
made
against
this
new
book
whose
publication
is
tactfully
timed
for
next
year
so
as
not
to
frighten
the
horses
Race
Course
Against

Supremacy
by
none
other
than
William

and
Bernardine

Meanwhile
it
turns
out
that
not
only
did
Obama
do
favours
for
convicted
Chicago
fraudster
Tony
Rezko
but
as
this
story
reports
Alexi
Giannoulias
who

bankrolled
Michael
Jaws
Giorango
a
Chicagoan

last

after

Steyn
Joe
the
Plumber
and
the
95
Percent
Tax
Cut
Myth
Mark
Steyn
is
deadly
as
usual
today--perhaps
even
deadlier
emphasis
mine
Give
a
man
enough
rope
line
and
he'll
hang
himself
There
was
His
Serene
Majesty
President-designate
Barack
the
Healer
working
the
crowd
at
some
or
other
hick
burg
and
halfway
down
the
rope
up
pops
a
plumber
to
express
misgivings
about
the
incoming
regime's
tax
plans
Supposedly
under
the
Obama
tax
plan
95
per
cent
of
the
American
people
will
get
a
tax
cut
You'd
think
that
at
this
point
the
natural
skepticism
of
any
sentient
being
other
than
six-week-old
puppies
might
kick
in
but
apparently
not
If
you're
wondering
why
Obama
didn't
simply
announce
that
under
his
plan
112
per
cent
of
the
American
people
will
get
a
tax
cut
well
they
ran
it
past
the
focus
groups
who
said
that
that
was
all
very
generous
but
they'd
really
like
it
if
he
could
find
a
way
to
stick
it
to
Dick
Cheney
Rush

Karl
Rove
and

So
95
per

inclinations

the

I
just

that

there's

You
will

Joe

it
around
just
fine
but
everyone
knows
trickle-down
economics

So
President-presumptive
Obama
kindly
explained
the
new
exquisitely
condescending
talking-down

Put
that

readers
I'm
hearing
from
looked
beyond
some
of
the
rot
around
her
there
and
focused
on
Palin
Here's
one
I
watched
Governor
Palin
on
SNL
last
night
Though
I
was
uncomfortable
with
all
the
slams
against
her
as
she
stood
and
sat
there
during
the
skits
I
came
away
with
even
more
admiration
for
her
She
can
stand
with
those
that
are
vehemently
opposed
to
her
yet
show
grace
humor
and
strength
That
is
exactly
the
kind
of
strength
poise
and
conviction
of
values
that
we
desperately
need
in
the
highest
office
of
our
land
By
the
way
am
I
wrong
to
think
Josh
Brolin
was
the
worst
commercial
for
his
movie
unless
you
have
Bush
Derangement
Syndrome
I
realize
I
am
not
the
target
audience
for
the
movie
but
you'd
think
they'd
take
my
ten
dollars
anyway.UPDATE

Sarah
Palin's
appearance
on
Saturday
Night
LIve
last
night
gave
the
show
its
highest
ratings
in
fourteen
years
It's
more
evidence
of
the
extraordinary
level
of
interest
in
Alaska's
governor
On
the
campaign
trail
she
has
repeatedly
drawn
crowds
numbering
in
the
tens
of
thousands
while
her
mere
existence
seems
to
be
an
affront
to
liberals
everywhere
What
is
it
about
Palin
that
draws
such
attention
She's
new
and
exotic
Alaska
is
a
genuinely
fascinating
place
She's
really
good
looking--poor
Tina
Fey
came
off
much
the
worse
last
night
Palin
exudes
a
certain
self-confidence
it
was
obvious
that
she
is
not
much
impressed
let
alone
intimidated
by
a
bunch
of
entertainers
Not
that
she
should
be
she
is
the
most
popular
governor
in
America
while
they
are...celebrities
But
for
whatever
reason
not
all
politicians
treat
entertainers
with
the
same
easy
confidence

on
Democrat
Agenda
Nationalizing
Your
401K
I
saw
this
today
in
the
Wall
Street
Journal
Only
it
is
not
as
bad
as
it
sounds...it's
much
worse
And
then
there
was
THIS
Because
the
Socialists
running
Congress
are
doing
such
an
exemplary
job
with
managing
your
Social
Security
and
Medicare
and
determining
which
poor
people
should
get
housing
loans
they
could
never
repay
the
same
Democrats
have
now
set
their
sights
on
your
401K
THIS
IS
NOT
A
DRILL
if
they
get
the
plurality
they
hope
to
get
in
November
look
for
this
to
happen
sooner
rather
than
later
perhaps
even
before
January
Read
and
weep--or
else
get
off
your
lazy
butts
and
throw
these
Marxist
vermin
out
on
their
collective
asses
where
they
belong
The
choice
is
yours
emphasis
mine
House
Education
and
Labor
Committee
Chairman
George
Miller
D-CA
is
holding
a
hearing
today
entitled
The
Impact
of
the
Financial
Crisis
on
Workers
Retirement
Security
In
reality
it's
a
dog-and-pony
show
to
advocate
for
the
nationalization
of
401(k
plans
The
theory
is
that
workers
are
too
stupid
to
manage
them
ourselves
so
we
need
to
have
the
government
do
it
for
us
Don't
believe
me
Here's
what
Dr
Teresa
Ghilarducci
one
of
the
star
witnesses
had
to
say
Going
forward
I
propose
Congress
establish
universal
Guaranteed
Retirement
Accounts
and
the
federal
government
deposit
600
inflation
indexed
in
those
Guaranteed
Retirement
Accounts
every
year
for
every
worker
Every
worker
not
in
an
equivalent
defined
benefit
plan
would
save
5
of
their
pay
into
their
Guaranteed
Retirement
Account
to
which
the
government
pays
a
3
inflation-indexed
guaranteed
return
Workers
would
earn
pension
credits
based
on
these
accumulations
Slowly
but
surely
your
country
your
wealth
and
your
freedom
is
being
stolen
out
from
under
your
noses
A
few
of
us
see
what
is
happening
sadly
the
majority
do
not
Short
of
an
out-and-out
revolution
waking
up
enough
of
our
citizens
to
what
is
happening
is
our
only
hope
How
many
modern

Paul
Revere's

The
British

coming
but
the
Marxists
are
already
here
and
they
are
about
this
steal
this
thing
out

The

you

Two
if
by

you
just

But
it
is
time
to
get
busy
not
just
with
the
like
minded
but
also
with
newspapers
and
other
periodicals
It
is
time
to
threaten
sponsors
to
stop
buying
their
products
who
advertise
on
propaganda
networks
like
CNN
and
MSNBC
It
is

It
is

to
give
money
until
it
hurts--because
it
is
going
to
hurt
a
lot
worse
if
these
Thugocrats
get
their
way
In
just
three
weeks
can
be
the
beginning
of
losing
your
right
to
have
your

counted
accurately
losing
your
weapons
and

and
even
your

who

and
talk
about

even

ALL
The

It

In
Case
you
Missed
This
Charles
Krauthammer
on
why
Obama's
past
is
fair
game
Obama's
political
career
was
launched
with
Ayers
giving
him
a
fundraiser
in
his
living
room
If
a
Republican
candidate
had
launched
his
political
career
at
the
home
of
an
abortion-clinic
bomber
even
a
repentant
one
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
run
for
dogcatcher
in
Podunk
And
Ayers
shows
no
remorse
His
only
regret
is
that
he
didn't
do
enough
Why
are
these
associations
important
Do
I
think
Obama
is
as
corrupt
as
Rezko
Or
shares
Wright's
angry
racism
or
Ayers's
unreconstructed
1960s
radicalism
No
But
that
does
not
make
these
associations
irrelevant
They
tell
us
two
important
things
about
Obama
First
his
cynicism
and
ruthlessness
He
found
these
men
useful
and
use
them
he
did
Would
you
attend
a
church
whose
pastor
was
spreading
racial
animosity
from
the
pulpit
Would
you
even
shake
hands
with
let
alone
serve
on
two
boards
with
an
unrepentant
terrorist
whether
he
bombed
U.S
military
installations
or
abortion
clinics
Most
Americans
would
not
on
the
grounds
of
sheer
indecency
Yet
Obama
did
if
not
out
of
conviction
then
out
of
expediency
He
was
a
young
man
on
the
make
an
unknown
outsider
working
his
way
into
Chicago
politics
He
played
the
game
with
everyone
without
qualms
and
with
obvious
success
Obama
is
not
the
first
politician
to
rise
through
a
corrupt
political
machine
But
he
is
one
of
the
rare
few
to
then
have
the
audacity
to
present
himself
as
a
transcendent
healer
hovering
above
and
bringing
redemption
to
the
old
politics
of
the
kind
he
had
enthusiastically
embraced
in
Chicago
in
the
service
of
his
own
ambition
Second
and
even
more
disturbing
than
the
cynicism
is
the
window
these
associations
give
on
Obama's
core
beliefs
He
doesn't
share
the
Rev
Wright's
poisonous
views
of
race
nor
Ayers's
views
past
and
present
about
the
evil
that
is
American
society
But
Obama
clearly
did
not
consider
these
views
beyond
the
pale
For
many
years
he
swam
easily
and
without
protest
in
that
fetid
pond
Until
now
Today
on
the
threshold
of
the
presidency
Obama
concedes
the
odiousness
of
these
associations
which
is
why
he
has
severed
them
But
for
the
years
in
which
he
sat
in
Wright's
pews
and
shared
common
purpose
on
boards
with
Ayers
Obama
considered
them
a
legitimate
indeed
unremarkable
part
of
social
discourse
Do
you
Obama
is
a
man
of
first-class
intellect
and
first-class
temperament
But
his
character
remains
highly
suspect
There
is
a
difference
between
temperament
and
character
Equanimity
is
a
virtue
Tolerance
of
the
obscene
is
not

whole

Preview
of
a
Thugocracy
Dan
Riehl
weighs
in
on
the
relentless
media
attacks
on
an
Ohio
plumber
Bill
Clinton
went
from
being
thought
of
as
the
first
black
President
to
actually
being
accused
of
racism
Among
others
McCain
has
now
faced
that
charge
as
well
Stanley
Kurtz
and
David
Fredossa
went
from
being
serious
journalists
and
solid
researchers
to
being
portrayed
as
perpetrators
of
hate
and
loathsome
smear
merchants
Sarah
Palin
no
matter
what
you
may
think
of
her
went
from
being
the
nation's
most
popular
governor
to
being
thought
of
as
a
mindless
boob
now
parenting
a
fifth
child
they
won't
even
accept
as
her
own
Now
via
Michelle
the
NY
Times
felt
compelled
to
weigh
in
on
a
would
be
plumber
It's
truly
sickening
to
see
that
just
about
every
on
line
MSM
news
site
is
reveling
in
taking
that
man
down
Just
scroll
Meanwhile
Obama's
treasurer
with
his
own
tax
liens
it
seems
Bill
Ayres
Franklin
Raines
Jeremiah
Wright
James
Johnson
Obama
himself
and
others
are
all
just
fine
ethical
upstanding
Americans
undeserving
of
any
real
scrutiny
I
guess
The
people
above
were
taken
down
by
Obama
supporters
in
and
out
of
the
MSM
his
actual
campaign
or
some
combination
thereof
The
O-body
count
is
growing
and
the
Left
and
Obama
haven't
really
even
achieved
any
power
of
the
executive
kind
so
far
Everyone
who
has
gotten
in
the
way
of
Obama's
path
to
power
has
been
horribly
run
down
It's
also
obvious
that
they
would
happily
destroy
them
if
they
could
If
you
needed
one
single
reason
to
vigorously
oppose
Obama
and
energetically
support
McCain
this
might
be
it
According
to
this
I'm
not
alone
in
thinking
that
And
yet
for
that
Joe
is
being
pilloried
every
aspect
of
his
private
and
professional
life
being
sorted
through
and
exposed
To
prove
what
What
does
that
have
to
do
with
Obama's
answer
What
does
Joe's
situation
have
to
do
with
Obama's
philosophical
answer
that
he
wants
to
spread
the
wealth
Obama's
answer
goes
down
the
memory
hole
while
the
nation
concentrates
its
fire
on
obliterating
Joe
the
Plumber
It's
sickening
it's
maddening
and
it's
downright
chilling
Sorry
for
the
length
But
I
am
just
SEETHING
And
if
all
that
isn't
enough
how
about
simply
giving
the
Netroots
and
Keith
Olbermann
a
truly
truly
horrible
day
If
you
think
it
is
bad
now
just
imagine
what
the
thugs
will
do
if
they
get
their
hands
on
all
the
reins
of
power

Joe

What
I
find
really
fascinating
is
the
fact
that
the
media
elites
are
treating
Joe
the
Plumber
as
if
he
is
the
one
who
is
out
of
step
with
mainstream
America
while
Bill
Ayers
is
an
Eagle
Scout
as
per
Tom
Frank
I'd
missed
the
Tom
Frank
bit
but
I
take
the
point
Plus
exterminate
all
the
brutes
And
also
inside
the
tanning-bed
media
There
is
a
stench
of
desperation
surrounding
this
as
if
they
sense
defeat
coming
from
a
moment
of
honesty
from
Obama
about
his
real
intentions
to
institute
a
regime
of
redistribution
They
want
to
discredit
the
man
who
only
asked
the
question
as
if
he's
some
political
operative
who
magically
forced
Obama
to
sound
well
a
little
like
a
Marxist
Why
They
want
to
distract
people
from
Obama's
answer
by
sliming
the
man
Obama
picked
at
random
to
ask
a
question
The
Tanning-Bed
Media
seems
to
feel
that
they
have
a
duty
to
expose
every
last
part
of
Wurzelbacher's
life
but
that
asking
Obama
to
explain
his
political
partnerships
with
Tony
Rezko
and
William
Ayers
and
his
long
friendship
and
financial
support
of
rabid
demagogues
Jeremiah
Wright
and
Michael
Pfleger
are
not
just
out
of
bounds
but
downright
racist
Whatever

New
Polls--Room
for
Hope
Allah
finds
some
rays
of
sunshine
He's
up
a
point
in
each
50/46
now
in
Rasmussen
his
best
showing
this
month
and
49/47
in
Gallup's
model
of
traditional
likely
voters
In
the
expanded
model
which
tries
to
account
for
the
higher
turnout
among
new
voters
that
will
probably
occur
this
year
it's
51/45
The
bad
news
Neither
tracker
includes
data
gathered
after
the
debate
which
means
he's
headed
for
another
downturn
if
the
CNN
and
CBS
snap
polls
last
night
were
right
but
a
major
uptick
if
Treach's
poll
of
one
was
The
good
news
From
Red
State
for
what
it's
worth
I
have
an
interesting
story
to
relay
that
took
place
earlier
this
week
between
my
boss
a
senior
VP
in
the
company
I
work
for
and
one
of
the
Obama
campaigns
internal
pollsters
As
she
was
explaining
her
perspective
it
dawned
on
her
to
ask
why
he
the
Obama
internal
pollster
was
interested
in
her
view
of
Palin
He
replied
that
Obama's
campaign
is
extremely
nervous
about
the
energized
republican
base
and
what
he
called
the
unkown
factor
regarding
Palin's
draw
as
a
candidate
In
the
polls
they're
conducting
around
the
country
and
my
boss
wasn't
able
to
relay
specific
numbers
the
Obama
campaign
is
very
very
worried
about
how
Palin
appears
to
be
energizing
whole
groups
of
people
who
don't
typically
get
energized
about
politics
precisely
because
she
appeals
so
strongly
to
the
middle
class
as
well
as
women
and
dissatisfied
republicans
that
stayed
home
in
2006
More
than
that
they
don't
know
how
to
guage
and
predict
the
support
of
people
typically
turned
off
by
politics
but
that
are
enamored
with
her
up
from
the
bootstraps
appeal
I
say
all
of
this
because
this
pollster
conveyed
strong
concern
about
their
standing
going
into
the
homestretch
They
are
very
concerned
about
winning
the
vote
of
the
middle
class
and
whole
swaths
of
the
electorate
they
consider
the
unkowns
In
fact
and
based
on
her
conversation
with
this
internal
pollster
for
Obama
he's
not
ahead
in
the
polls
as
we're
being
told
He's
at
best
tied
I.e
it's
not
just
The
One
who
might
have
an
impact
on
that
expanded
likely
voter
model
Remember
Tapper
also
claimed
recently
to
have
heard
from
sources
in
the
Obama
camp
that
objects
in
their
rear-view
mirror
are
closer
than
they
appear
Exit
question
Perfunctory

Ruling
Forcing
Verification
of
Ballots
to
Supreme
Court
Via
Michelle
Malkin
Ohio
prosecutor
investigating
Voter
Fraud
House
Early
this
morning
I
told
you
about
the
suspicious
houseful
of
out-of-state
Democrat
activists
studying
abroad
who
registered
to
vote
received
absentee
ballots
and
in
some
cases
voted
despite
dubious
residency
and
having
no
plans
to
return
to
Ohio
first
reported
by
Shelby
Holliday
and
Tiffany
Wilson
at
Palestra.net
Now
comes
official
word
that
the
Franklin
County
prosecutor
is
investigating
13
of
those
activists
from
Vote
From
Home
Amid
new
allegations
of
voter
fraud
the
Ohio
Secretary
of
State
conceded
today
that
the
eligibility
of
nearly
one
third
of
newly
registered
voters
is
in
question
The
latest
developments
raising
questions
about
the
integrity
of
this
battleground
state's
voting
system
came
18
days
before
the
Nov
4
presidential
election
Secretary
of
State
Jennifer
Brunner
said
a
preliminary
review
showed
that
200,000
of
the
666,000
voters
who
registered
since
Jan
1
must
have
their
eligibility
verified
to
comply
with
a
federal
court
order
Franklin
County
Prosecutor
Ron
O'Brien
confirmed
that
he
is
investigating
alleged
voter
and
registration
fraud
involving
13
newly
registered
voters
who
came
to
Columbus
for
a
get-out-the-vote
campaign
and
used
the
same
address
a
small
East
Side
home
The
Ohio
Republican
Party
requested
information
about
newly
registered
voters
from
elections
boards
in
all
88
counties
to
look
into
reports
of
fraudulent
voter
registration
Elections
officials
across
the
state
said
they
fear
chaos
if
they
must
verify
the
validity
of
thousands
of
newly
registered
voters
in
the
busy
days
leading
up
to
the
election
O'Brien
told
The
Dispatch
that
he
is
investigating
allegations
that
13
out-of-state
residents
recently
registered
to
vote
all
claiming
to
live
at
2885
Brownlee
Rd
The
individuals
apparently
were
in
Columbus
working
for
Vote
From
Home
a
group
working
to
increase
young-voter
turnout
in
Ohio
and
using
the
house
as
their
base
of
operation
O'Brien
said
None
of
the
people
who
registered
had
prior
contacts
with
Columbus
and
Franklin
County
O'Brien
said
You
must
be
a
resident
of
the
state
of
Ohio
in
order
to
register
and
cast
a
ballot
and
that's
the
issue
being
examined
whether
they
were
proper
residents
of
Ohio
Two
of
the
individuals
voted
in
person
at
Veteran's
Memorial
while
a
third
returned
a
completed
absentee
ballot
by
mail
said
Matt
Damshroder
deputy
director
of
the
Franklin
County
Board
of
Elections
Another
seven
using
the
address
requested
absentee
ballots
by
mail
but
it
is
not
yet
clear
if
they
have
submitted
them
Three
others
registered
but
did
not
request
an
absentee
ballot
or
participate
in
early
voting
Election
fraud
is
a
fifth-degree
felony
with
a
maximum
sentence
of
a
year
in
prison
and
a
2,500
fine
Shelby
has
an
interview
with
the
Franklin
County
prosecutor
here
I
would
add
that
authorities
need
to
be
investigating
the
Vote
From
Home
activists
tax
activities
as
well
Since
these
activists
have
declared
themselves
residents
of
Ohio
they
will
probably
need
to
pay
taxes
to
both
Ohio
and
the
U.S
Department
of
the
Treasury
on
their
scholarships
Look
For
Ohio
residents
retirement
income
pension
income
and
annuity
income
are
taxable
regardless
of
where
received
by
the
taxpayer
For
example
a
full
year
Ohio
resident
who
spends
part
of
the
year
in
Ohio
and
part
of
the
year
in
Florida
and
who
receives
a
pension
is
liable
for
Ohio
income
tax
on
the
entire
amount
of
the
pension
received
during
the
taxable
year
This
is
true
regardless
of
the
location
where
the
taxpayer
worked
in
prior
years
to
earn
the
pension
Part-year
Ohio
residents
are
persons
who
changed
their
permanent
residence
from
or
to
Ohio
during
the
taxable
year
A
person
whose
residence
is
Ohio
but
who
spends
several
months
outside
Ohio
during
the
year
is
not
a
part-year
resident
but
is
a
full-year
Ohio
resident
For
part-year
Ohio
residents
retirement
income
pension
income
and
annuity
income
received
while
a
resident
of
Ohio
are
taxable

According

No

Meanwhile
fraud-friendly
Democrat
Secretary
of
State
Jennifer
Brunner
acknowledged
that
some
200,000
voters
appear
to
have
driver's
license
numbers
or
Social
Security
numbers
that
do
not
match
info
on
their
voter
registration
forms
The
6th
U.S
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
ruled
on
Tues
day
that
Brunner
must
give
those
mismatched
names
to
county
elections
boards
so
they
can
verify
eligibility
Brunner
said
that
she
wants
more
time
to
comply
with
the
court's
ruling
so
she
can
give
local
boards
information
needed
to
contact
questionable
voters
in
the
most
efficient
way
We
are
asking
the
court
for
a
little
bit
more
time
probably
into
the
beginning
of
next
week
Brunner
said
prior
to
a
speech
at
the
National
Press
Club
in
Washington
Looks
like
someone
needs

spend

at

appealed

decision
to

Via

Secretary
Of

Appeals
Voter
Case
To
Supreme
Court
In
this
case
that
means....Justice
John
Paul
Stevens
Ohio's
top
election
official
has
asked
the
Supreme
Court
to
put
on
hold
a
federal
judge's
order
requiring
steps
to
verify
the
voter
registration
rolls
across
the
state
arguing
that
the
order
had
destabilized
the
election
situation
just
three
weeks
before
voters
go
to
the
polls
An
application
for
stay
Brunner
v
Ohio
Republican
Party
et
al
08A332
was
filed
Wednesday
night
with
Justice
John
Paul
Stevens
who
handles
emergency
matters
from
the
Sixth
Circuit
The
application
contended
that
the
order
may
encourage
a
flood
of
lawsuits
across
the
nation
disrupting
the
election
process
and
threatening
to
require
many
voters
to
cast
provisional
ballots
thus
perhaps
deterring
them
from
voting
Justice
Stevens
may
act
without
asking
state
GOP
officials
to
respond
or
wait
until
there
is
a
response
He
also
has
the
option
of
sharing
a
decision
with
his
Court
colleagues
or
acting
alone
I'll
leave

My
Verdict
McCain
Better
but
lots
of
missed
opportunities
By
far
McCain's
best
debate
and
anyone
who
watched
the
first
two
could
see
that
Obama
spent
most
of
the
time
regurgitating
the
same
talking
points
he
used
in
the
first
two
yawn
However
McCain
missed
some
HUGE
opportunities
especially
on
the
so-called
Tax
Cut
for
95
of
Working
Americans
especially
when
only
60
of
working
Americans
PAY
any
taxes
now
just
do
the
math
He
also
could
have
landed
solid
punches
on
Obama's
judgment
Obama
had
no
idea
what
ACORN
was
up
to
all
those
years
he
gave
them
legal
services
training
and
800,000
cash
that
we
know
of
he
also
had
no
idea
what
the
Reverand
Wright
was
saying
from
the
pulpit
all
those
20
years
he
spent
in
as
his
mentor
and
giving
him
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
he
went
from
Ayers
being
some
guy
in
the
neighborhood
to
serving
on
two
boards
with
him
launching
his
Senate
campaign
from
Ayers
home
and
doling
out
over
a
million
dollars
of
Ayers
money
to
radical
causes--but
he
had
no
idea
of
Ayers
radical
past
right
his
participation
on
Farrakhan's
million
man
march
he
had
no
idea
that
Rezko's
purchase
of
that
700,000
plot
of
land
on
the
same
day
he
bought
a
house
on
an
adjacent
lot
was
financed
with
money
from
a
Syrian
supporter
of
Hezbollah
But
he
wouldn't
go
there
So
Obama
comes
off
squeakly
clean
even
though
he
may
be
the
sleaziest
politician
in
decades
He
makes
Bill
Clinton
look
like
an
ethicist
But
no
Johnnie
has
to
be
above
all
that
Fine
So
we
get
4
years
of
Marxist
hell
probably
ushering
in
a
real
live
Depression
That
is
putting
his
country
first
Not
in
my
book
MAYBE
you
could
say
McCain
won
on
points
Arguably
you
can
But
it
was
no
knockout--and
Obama
dropped
his
left
several
times
Reagan
would
not
have
missed
those
opportunities
and
Reagan
would
have
decked
him
But
McCain
is
no

Folks
it
does
not
get
any
more
dangerous
than
this
Florida
2000
is
a
picnic
in
comparison
And
Barack
Obama
is
sitting
atop
the
entire
corrupt
monstrosity
insulated
from
almost
all
media
criticism
just
like
Chavez
and
hiding
almost
every
single
detail
of
what
he
would
actually
do
does
the
name
Stalin
ring
a
bell
Rest
assured
that
none
of
it
involves
Capitalism
and
Free
Markets
Barack
Obama
is
now
and
always
has
been
a
hard-core
Marxist
That
is
simply
a
fact
He
has
been
endorsed
by
Russia
Iran
Venezuela
Cuba
Libya
China
Syria
and
has
gotten
illegal
funding
from
most
if
not
all
of
the
above
links
to
follow
later
Will
McCain
call
him
out
on
these
things
tonight
And
will
it
be
too
little
too
late
Or
will
he
simply
continue
his
vapid
cowardly
retreat
to
he's
an
honorable
man
etc
Where
I
come
from
it
is
dishonorable
to
NOT
identify
why
your
opponent
would
be
a
disastrous
But
don't
hold
your
breath
hoping
for
a
miracle
there
This
is
the
most
dangerous
election
in
American
history
And
it
is
going
to
get
much
worse
before
it
gets
better

that

has

only
to

Her

to

block
the
transparency
of

and
refuse
the
proper
verification
of
newly

have
rightfully
damaged
her
credibility
as

administrator
She
is
destroying

Meanwhile
the

broken

here's
a

respectively
Note
the
point
made
by
the
correspondent
in
the
latter
clip
or
by
the
Republican
lawyer
quoted
here
It's
not
really
voter
impersonation
that's
the
big
worry
it's
the
logistical
nightmare
of
poll
workers
having
to
sift
so
many
bogus
registration
forms
that
bona
fide
registrations
can't
be
processed
in
a
timely
manner
Which
is
a
problem
but
given
the
trend
in
party
identification
especially
among
new

would
seem
to
be
more
of
a
problem
for
Democrats
than

more

that

are
part

of
the

Obama
Co-Sponsored

to
Shield

From
Lawsuits
Marinka
Peschmann
at
the
Canada
Free
Press
continues
to
do
the
work
the
US
media
refuses
to
do
In
her
latest
column
Marinka
discovered
that
Barack
Obama
co-sponsored
legislation
to
protect
ACORN
from
criminal
prosecution
for
harassing
banks
to
approve
loans
for
individuals
who
could
not
afford
them
These
practices
helped
push
our
country
into
its
current
economic
crisis
But
thanks
to
Barack
Obama
ACORN
will
not
have
to
worry
about
facing
any
consequences
for
its
dubious
practices
The
Canada
Free

reported
Not
only
did
Barack
Obama's
presidential
campaign
pay
more
than
U.S
800,000
to
a
front
of
the
Association
of
Community
Organizations
for
Reform
Now
ACORN
currently
under
investigation
in
a
dozen
States
for
voter
registration
fraud
and
bribery
schemes
for
get-out-the-vote-efforts
Obama
co-sponsored
legislation
called
the
Helping
Families
Save
their
Homes
in
Bankruptcy
Act
of
2007
that
was
supported
by
ACORN
and
protects
them
Why
would
groups
like
ACORN
who
according
to
Stanley
Kurtz's
O
Dangerous
Pals
undermined
the
US
economy
by
pushing
the
banking
system
into
a
sinkhole
of
bad
loans
by
forcing
banks
to
make
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
subprime
loans
to
often
un-creditworthy
poor
and
minority
customers
support
this
legislation
Perhaps
because
it
provides
Chapter
13
Bankruptcy
protections
to
homeowners
who
didn't
have
the
means
to
buy
homes
and
it
protects
people
who
put
those
borrowers
into
these
high-risk
mortgages
Another
key
reason
why
groups
like
ACORN
support
this
legislation
because
it
Prohibits
the
court
from
allowing
a
claim
that
is
subject
to
any
remedy
for
damages
or
rescission
due
to
failure
to
comply
with
the
Truth
in
Lending
Act
or
any
other
state
or
federal
consumer
protection
law
The
Truth
in
Lending
Act
TILA
was
designed
to
create
economic
stabilization
and
competition
by
informed
use
of
credit
by
consumers
emphasis
added
Under
TILA
the
law
also
applies
to
persons
who
are
not
creditors
but
who
provide
applications
for
home
equity
plans
to
consumers
This
bill
absolves
organizations
of
any
guilt
or
culpability
under
TILA
perhaps
the
same
organizations
who
intimidated
and
bullied
banks
into
providing
risky
loans
to
unqualified
borrowers
like
ACORN
If
this
legislation
does
not
pass
then
these
persons
who
are
not
creditors
could
face
criminal
penalties
for
willful
and
knowing
violations
of
TILA
which
could
result
in
a
fine
of
5,000
imprisonment

That

to
me
I
know
that
there
have

with

fraud

existed
since
the
ballot
box
But
what
ACORN
is
doing
with
1.3
million
voter

turned
in

is
akin
to
what
I
have
seen
in
places
like
Belarus
All
1.3
million
of
those
registrations
should
be
considered
suspect
If
the

is
allowed
to

would

brilliant

the

and

all
the

for
Spreading

Virus
read
this
ponder
it
soak
it
in
To
discover
the
roots
of
to
day's
economic
crisis
consider
a
tale
from
1995
That
March
House
Speaker
Newt
Gingrich
was
scheduled
to
address
a
meeting
of
county
commissioners
at
the
Washington
Hilton
But
first
some
500
protesters
from
the
Association
of
Community
Organizations
for
Reform
Now
ACORN
poured
into
the
ballroom
from
both
the
kitchen
and
the
main
entrance
Hotel
staffers
who
tried
to
block
them
were
quickly
overwhelmed
by
demonstrators
chanting
Nuke
Newt
and
We
want
Newt
Jamming
the
aisles
carrying
bullhorns
and
taunting
the
assembled
county
commissioners
demonstrators
swiftly
took
over
the
head
table
and
commandeered
the
microphone
sending
two
members
of
Congress
scurrying
The
demonstrators
target
Gingrich
hadn't
yet
arrived
and
his
speech
was
cancelled
When
the
cancellation
was
announced
ACORN's
foot
soldiers
cheered
Editorial
writers
from
Little
Rock
to
Buffalo
condemned
ACORN's
action
as
an
affront
to
both
civility
and
freedom
of
speech
Editorialists
also
pointed
out
that
the
spending
cuts
the
protesters
railed
against
were
imaginary
Gingrich
proposed
merely
to
slow
the
growth
in
some
welfare
programs
and
turn
control
back
to
the
states
Yet
ACORN
had
only
just
begun
Two
days
later
50
to
100
of
the
same
protesters
hit
their
main
target
a
House
Banking
subcommittee
considering
changes
to
the
Community
Reinvestment
Act
a
law
that
allows
groups
like
ACORN
to
force
banks
into
making
high-risk
loans
to
low-credit
customers
The
CRA's
ostensible
purpose
is
to
prevent
banks
from
discriminating
against
minorities
But
Rep
Marge
Roukema
R-NJ
who
chaired
the
subcommittee
was
worried
that
charges
of
discrimination
had
become
an
excuse
for
lowering
credit
standards
She
warned
that
new
Democrat-proposed
CRA
regulations
could
amount
to
an
illegal
quota
system
FOR
years
ACORN
had
combined
manipulation
of
the
CRA
with
intimidation-protest
tactics
to
force
banks
to
lower
credit
standards
Its
crusade
with
help
from
Democrats
in
Congress
to
push
these
high-risk
subprime
loans
on
banks
is
at
the
root
of
today's
economic
meltdown
When
the
role
of
ACORN
and
congressional
Democrats
in
the
mortgage
crisis
is
pointed
out
Democrats
reply
that
banks
subject
to
the
CRA
represent
only
about
a
quarter
of
the
loans
that
led
to
our
current
troubles
In
fact
the
problem
goes
way
beyond
the
CRA
As
ACORN
ran
its
campaigns
against
local
banks
it
quickly
hit
a
roadblock
Banks
would
tell
ACORN
they
could
afford
to
reduce
their
credit
standards
by
only
a
little
since
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
the
federal
mortgage
giants
refused
to
buy
up
those
risky
loans
for
sale
on
the
secondary
market
That
is
the
CRA
wasn't
enough
Unless
Fannie
and
Freddie
were
willing
to
relax
their
credit
standards
as
well
local
banks
would
never
make
home
loans
to
customers
with
bad
credit
histories
or
with
too
little
money
for
a
downpayment
So
ACORN's
Democratic
friends
in
Congress
moved
to
force
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
to
dispense
with
normal
credit
standards
Throughout
the
early
90s
they
imposed
ever-increasing
subprime-lending
quotas
on
Fannie
and
Freddie
But
then
the
Republicans
won
control
of
Congress
and
Rep
Roukema
scheduled
her
hearing
ACORN
went
into
action
to
protect
its
golden
goose
IT
struck
as
Roukema
aired
her
concerns
at
that
hearing
Pro
testers
led
by
ACORN
President
Maud
Hurd
stood
up
and
began
chanting
CRA
has
got
to
stay
and
Banks
for
greed
not
for
need
The
protesters
then
demanded
the
microphone
With
the
hearing
interrupted
and
the
demonstrators
refusing
to
leave
Roukema
called
the
Capital
Police
who
arrested
Hurd
and
four
others
for
disorderly
conduct
in
a
Capital
building
a
charge
carrying
a
penalty
of
a
500
fine
six
months
in
prison
or
both
As
the
police
arrived
two
of
the
protesters
menacingly
approached
Roukema's
desk
still
demanding
the
hearing
microphone
Requests
to
the
Capital
Police
to
release
the
activists
from
Sen
Ted
Kennedy
D-Mass
and
Rep
Joe
Kennedy
D-Mass
failed
Then
Rep
Maxine
Waters
D-Calif
showed
up
at
the
jail
and
refused
to
leave
until
the
protesters
were
released
the
Capital
Police
relented
Meanwhile
instead
of
repudiating
ACORN's
intimidation
tactics
Rep
Kennedy
berated
Roukema
for
arresting
one
of
his
constituents
and
accused
the
Republicans
of
preparing
for
an
all-out
attack
on
CRA
He
also
promised
to
introduce
legislation
to
expand
the
CRA's
coverage
to
mortgage
bankers
and
large
credit
unions
THIS
little
slice
of
political
life
from
1995
had
a
variety
of
ripple
effects
Above
all
ACORN's
intimidation
tactics
and
its
alliance
with
Democrats
in
Congress
triumphed
Despite
their
1994
takeover
of
Congress
Republicans
attempts
to
pare
back
the
CRA
were
stymied
Instead
Democrats
like
Rep
Barney
Frank
D-Mass
and
Reps
Kennedy
and
Waters
allied
with
the
Clinton
administration
to
broaden
the
acceptability
of
risky
subprime
loans
throughout
the
financial
system
thus
precipitating
our
current
crisis
ACORN
had
come
to
Congress
not
only
to
protect
the
CRA
from
GOP
reforms
but
also
to
expand
the
reach
of
quota-based
lending
to
Fannie
Freddie
and
beyond
By
steamrolling
the
GOP
that
March
it
had
crushed
the
last
potential
barrier
to
change
Three
months
later
the
Clinton
administration
announced
a
comprehensive
strategy
to
push
homeownership
in
America
to
new
heights
regardless
of
the
compromise
in
credit
standards
that
the
task
would
require
Fannie
and
Freddie
were
assigned
massive
subprime
lending
quotas
which
would
rise
to
about
half
of
their
total
business
by
the
end
of
the
decade
WHEN
the
ACORN-Democrat
alliance
finally
succeeded
in
blocking
Republicans
from
restoring
fiscal
sanity
in
1995
the
way
was
open
to
virtually
unlimited
lending
quotas
and
to
a
whole
new
way
of
thinking
about
credit
standards
Urged
on
by
ACORN
congressional
Democrats
and
the
Clinton
administration
helped
push
tolerance
for
high-risk
loans
through
every
sector
of
the
banking
system
far
beyond
the
sort
of
banks
originally
subject
to
the
CRA
So
it
was
the
efforts
of
ACORN
and
its
Democratic
allies
that
first
spread
the
subprime
virus
from
the
CRA
to
Fannie
and
Freddie
and
thence
to
the
entire
financial
system
Soon
Democratic
politicians
and
regulators
actually
began
to
take
pride
in
lowered
credit
standards
as
a
sign
of
fairness
and
the
contagion
spread
And
when
financial
institutions
across
the
board
saw
that
they
could
make
money
by
trading
what
would
once
have
been
considered
junk
loans
the
profit
motive
kicked
in
But
the
bad
seed
that
started
it
all
was
ACORN
HOW
does
Barack
Obama
fit
into
all
of
this
Obama
has
been
a
key
ally
of
Chicago
ACORN
going
back
to
his
days
as
a
community
organizer
Later
as
a
young
lawyer
he
offered
leadership
training
to
the
activists
who
were
forcing
Chicago
banks
into
high-risk
subprime
loans
And
when
he
made
it
on
to
the
boards
of
Chicago's
Woods
Fund
and
the
Chicago
Annenberg
Challenge
he
channeled
money
ACORN's
way
Obama
was
perfectly
aware
of
ACORN's
intimidation
tactics
indeed
he
oversaw
a
Woods
Fund
report
that
boasted
of
managing
to
fund
the
radical
group
despite
its
shocking
behavior
And
as
a
lawmaker
in
Illinois
and
in
Washington
he
has
continued
to
back
ACORN's
leglislative
agenda
ACORN's
high-pressure
tactics
live
on
And
congressional
Democrats
are
still
covering
for
ACORN
funneling
it
money
and
doing
its
legislative
bidding
ACORN
also
continues
its
shady
ways
using
a
vast
network
of
technically
separate
but
in
fact
quite
interconnected
organizations
to
evade
federal
laws
on
the
politicized
use
of
government
money
Perhaps
most
disturbing
of
all
the
Obama
campaign
appears
to
have
little
more
regard
for
freedom
of
speech
than
Reps
Kennedy
or
Waters
did
when
they
backed
up
ACORN's
thugs
in
1995
The
campaign
actually
practices
ACORN-style
tactics
sending
out
action
wires
that
call
on
supporters
to
block
Obama
critics
from
radio
appearances
a
tactic
once
applied
to
me
and
demanding
legal
actions
against
unfriendly
political
advertisers
As
a
presidential
candidate
Obama
promises
a
massive
national-service
program
closely
allied
with
the
nonprofit
sector
He
wants
to
remove
barriers
for
smaller
nonprofits
to
participate
in
government
programs
In
other
words
he
plans
a
massive
effort
to
funnel
America's
youth
into
volunteer
work
alongside
the
likes
of
ACORN
So
Obama's
favorite
community
organizers
may
soon
be
training
your
child
ACORN's
alliance
with
the
Democratic
Party
is
at
the
root
of
the
current
financial
meltdown
And
Barack
Obama
has
stayed
true
to
ACORN's
ways
Pretty
soon
the
folks
who
poured
into
the
Washington
Hilton
to
shut
down
Speaker
Gingrich
in
1995
may
no
longer
need
to
take
over
the
microphone
They'll
be
in
charge
of
it
Don't
take
this
warning
from
Kurtz
lightly
Brian
Anderson
paints
a
pretty
clear
picture
of
his
own
in
today's
Investor
Business
Daily
Conservative-friendly
media
better
get
ready
Should
Barack
Obama
win
the
presidency
and
the
Democrats
control
Congress
as
now
seems
likely
they
will
launch
a
full-scale
war
to
drive
critics
especially
on
political
talk
radio
right
out
of
legitimate
public
debate
Signs
of
what
the
new
environment
will
be
like
for
the
right
are
already
evident
When
the
National
Rifle
Association
recently
released
television
and
radio
ads
in
Pennsylvania
targeting
Obama's
history
of
anti-gun
votes
the
Obama
campaign's
general
counsel
fired
off
bullying
letters
to
stations
that
ran
the
spots
implying
that
they
may
have
violated
public-interest
obligations
When
the
527
group
the
American
Issues
Project
came
out
with
a
commercial
linking
Obama
to
former
Weather
Underground
terrorist
William
Ayers
the
campaign
unsuccessfully
complained
to
the
Department
of
Justice
that
AIP
had
broken
campaign
finance
laws
and
managed
to
spook
some
stations
away
from
the
ad
When
two
different
conservative
writers
looking
into
Obama's
background
appeared
on
Chicago's
WGN-AM
Radio
the
campaign's
action
wire
energized
its
activists
to
bombard
the
station
with
rage-filled
phone
calls
and
e-mails
making
the
program
more
difficult
to
conduct
The
show
hosted
by
the
eminently
reasonable
Milt
Rosenberg
had
on
both
occasions
invited
the
Obama
campaign
to
send
a
representative
to
respond
the
campaign
preferred
to
answer
with
digital
brownshirts
These
crude
efforts
are
only
a
start
A
Democrat-controlled
Washington
will
use
sweeping
new
rules
to
shush
conservative
political
speech
For
starters
expect
a
real
push
to
bring
back
the
Fairness
Doctrine
True
Obama
says
he
isn't
in
favor
of
re-imposing
this
regulation
which
until
Ronald
Reagan's
FCC
junked
it
in
the
80s
required
broadcasters
to
give
airtime
to
opposing
viewpoints
or
face
fines
or
even
loss
of
license
But
most
top
Democrats
including
Nancy
Pelosi
are
revved
up
about
the
idea
and
it's
hard
to
imagine
Obama
vetoing
a
new
doctrine
if
Congress
delivers
him
one
Make
no
mistake
a
new
Fairness
Doctrine
would
vaporize
political
talk
radio
the
one
major
medium
dominated
by
the
right
If
a
station
ran
a
successful
conservative
program
like
say
Mark
Levin's
it
would
also
have
to
run
a
left-leaning
alternative
even
if
as
with
Air
America
and
all
other
liberal
efforts
in
the
medium
to
date
it
can't
find
any
listeners
or
sponsors
Then
there
are
all
the
lawyers
you'd
have
to
hire
to
fend
off
the
government
regulators
Too
much
hassle
many
radio
executives
would
conclude
better
switch
to
entertainment
coverage
or
some
other
anodyne
format
In
1980
it's
worth
recalling
talk
shows
of
any
kind
numbered
fewer
than
100
nationwide
not
thousands
like
today
And
Obama
does
say
he
wants
to
tighten
media
ownership
regulations
and
expand
the
public
interest
duties
of
broadcasters
including
by
imposing
greater
local
accountability
on
them
that
is
forcing
stations
to
carry
more
local
programming
even
if
the
public
isn't
demanding
it
which
it
isn't
This
measure
aimed
at
national
syndicators
like
Salem
Radio
that
make
conservative
shows
available
from
coast
to
coast
is
just
a
sneakier
way
of
shrinking
the
listenership
of
hosts
like
William
Bennett
or
Hugh
Hewitt
or
even
getting
them
off
the
air
altogether
Obama
like
congressional
Democrats
also
wants
to
regulate
the
Internet
the
only
other
medium
in
which
the
right
does
well
via
its
influential
bloggers
The
means
here
something
called
network
neutrality
Neutrality
if
enacted
would
give
government
overseers
at
the
FCC
the
power
to
ensure
that
Internet
providers
treated
equally
all
the
information
bits
surging
across
the
Web's
pipes
its
cables
fiber
optics
phone
lines
and
wireless
connections
This
measure
makes
zero
economic
sense
Broadband
providers
want
to
manage
more
actively
and
thus
profitably
those
information
bits
They'd
like
to
offer
for
instance
new
superfast
delivery
for
sites
or
users
willing
to
pay
more
not
unlike
how
FedEx
speeds
delivery
of
packages
for
a
fee
or
other
new
services
such
as
online
video
or
telephony
Network
neutrality
would
render
all
that
illegal
But
why
then
should
broadband
investors
keep
building
the
Web
infrastructure
needed
to
keep
pace
with
surging
use
Where's
their
financial
incentive
Yet
if
that
infrastructure
isn't
in
place
soon
the
vast
amount
of
data
pouring
online
will
begin
to
slow
the
Web
to
a
crawl
many
experts
believe
Needless
to
say
neutrality
also
will
be
a
gold
mine
to
telecom
lawyers
who'll
have
their
hands
full
figuring
out
what
constitutes
digital
discrimination
But
the
biggest
potential
danger
of
neutrality
is
that
its
concern
for
equal
treatment
of
bits
will
extend
to
sites
content
creating
a
kind
of
Fairness
Doctrine
for
the
Web
as
FCC
Commissioner
Robert
McDowell
has
warned
and
as
Obama
adviser
and
law
professor
Cass
Sunstein
once
called
for
Not
coincidentally
hampering
the
alternative
media
with
new
regulations
would
leave
the
liberal
mainstream
press
which
still
enjoys
full
First
Amendment
protections
comparatively
empowered
Given
how
the
MSM
has
covered
this
presidential
race
fawning
over
Obama
and
pummeling
John
McCain
and
especially
his
charismatic
running
mate
Sarah
Palin
at
every
opportunity
it's
easy
to
see
why
many
liberals
may
be
hoping
for
a
media
restoration
Today
it's
the
new
Brownshirts
and
the
Thugocracy
unless
America
wakes
up--and
fast--we
are
only
a
few
months
away
from
a
new
STASI
All
the
Democrats
need
to
make
it
all
happen
are
your
votes
whether
McCain
has
the
cojones
to
bring
it
up
or
not

There
has
been
a
big
buzz
on
the
blogospere
since
US
mega-blog
Powerline
picked
up
on
evidence
proving
that
Barack
Obama
was
in
the
mid
90s
a
member
of
a
short-lived
socialist
organisation
the
Chicago
New
Party
Democratic
Socialists
of
America
DSA
which
also
endorsed
Obama
that
year
and
to
which
the
Senator
has
longstanding
and
ongoing
ties
has
also
been
dragged
into
the
fray
The
Obama
camp
has
countered
in
two
ways
Firstly-claiming
that
while
Obama
was
endorsed
by
the
New
Party
he
was
never
a
member
That
lie
is
easily
disposed
of

victories
prove
that
small
d
democracy
can
work
said
Obama
Secondly-supporters
claim
that
the
New
Party
was
not
actually
socialist
Long
time
Obama
associate
and
former
Chicago
New
Party
activist
Carl
Davidson
has
posted
this
statement
on
several
blogs
The
New
Party
in
Chicago
was
never
a
socialist
party
DSA
in
Chicago
had
little
to
do
with
it
in
any
practical
way
It
was
a
pragmatic
party
of
small
d
democracy
mainly
promoting
economic
reforms
like
the
living
wage
and
testing
the
fusion
tactic
common
in
many
countries
but
only
operational
in
New
York
in
the
US
The
main
trend
within
it
was
ACORN
an
Alinskyist
outfit
which
is
hardly
Marxist
Most
socialist
left
groups
either
ignored
it
or
opposed
it
even
if
a
few
of
their
members
took
part
in
it
That's
the
truth
of
the
matter
This
is
so
far
from
the
truth
The
New
Party
was
the
creation
of
DSA
and
the
radical
community
organisation
ACORN-which
was
in
itself
something
of
a
DSA
front
In
some
areas
the
Communist
Party
USA
CPUSA
was
involved
but
in
Chicago
the
CPUSA
splinter
group
Committees
of
Correspondence
CoC)was
more
prominent
Carl
Davidson
is
well
aware
that
Marxists
set
up
the
Chicago
New
Party
because
he
was
one
of
them
From
Chicago
DSA's
New
Ground
of
March/April
1995
On
January
27th
approximately
45
people
attended
the
Chicago
DSA
and
Chicago
CoC
organized
public
form
at
the
ACTWU
hall
on
Ashland
Ave
Chicago
DSA
was
represented
by
Co-Chair
Kurt
Anderson
and
Political
Education
Officer
Bob
Roman
CoC
was
represented
by
Carl
Davidson
who
is
a
member
of
CoC's
National
Coordinating
Committee
and
Ronelle
Mustin
an
activist
from
the
22nd
ward
The
event
was
chaired
by
Sandi
Patrinos
chair
of
Chicago
CoC
Carl
Davidson
wanted
to
focus
on
voting
patterns
To
win
elections
Davidson
emphasized
that
there
are
two
necessary
coinciding
factors
First
a
passive
majority
Secondly
a
militant
minority
Davidson
emphasized
that
in
this
historical
period
the
Left's
strategy
must
be
electoral
politics
not
revolution
Consequently
the
Left
must
galvanize
the
majority
the
working
class
and
poor
Moreover
the
democratic
left
needs
get
active
in
the
New
Party
which
has
won
20
of
30
local
elections
Thus
a
short-term
strategy
of
working
with
the
Democratic
Party
and
in
the
long-term
work
with
the
New
Party
If
that's
not
clear
enough
I
quote
from
Chicago
DSA's
New
Ground
of
September/October
1995

Danny

Obama's
most
loyal

Carl
Davidson
is
right
in
that
the
Chicago
New
Party
was
not
OPENLY
socialist
It
was
designed
a
vehicle
for
socialists
to
infiltrate
leftist
candidates
into
positions
of
power
through
the
Democratic
Party
So
Chicago
New

was
socialist
dominated

In

first

the

founders
state
their
organization
descended
from
the
proud
tradition
of
independent

movements
that
have
made
America
a

country
Is
this
a

stated
it

Money
Time
for
America
Peggy
Noonan
on
the
Presidential
race
I
don't
believe
any
of
the
polls
this
year
or
rather
the
situation
is
too
fluid
to
believe
them
for
more
than
a
day
But
Democrats
should
remain
concerned
about
this
We
have
two
wars
an
economic
collapse
a
two-term
Republican
president
at
historic
lows
in
popularity
overwhelmingly
negative
poll
answers
on
whether
America
is
on
the
right
track
and
the
Democratic
presidential
nominee
isn't
20
points
ahead
Thirty
This
should
be
a
landslide
They
say
Barack
Obama
cannot
close
the
deal
He
hasn't
closed
the
deal
because
he's
still
making
the
pitch
and
to
a
wary
customer
who
wants
something
new
but
isn't
sure
this
is
the
time
to
buy
More
Peggy
Noonan
Here's
where
Mr
Obama
hopes
to
close
the
deal
in
the
half-hour
network
address
his
campaign
announced
Thursday
He
will
speak
as
a
potential
leader
to
a
nation
in
crisis
That's
where
the
deal
will
close
or
not
The
McCain
campaign
has
famously
spent
the
past
week
trying
to
increase
doubts
as
to
Mr
Obama's
nature
background
intentions
Their
crowds
have
been
irascible
Here
is
a
warning
for
Republicans
When
your
crowds
go
from
I
love
you
to
I
hate
the
other
guy
you
are
in
trouble
you
are
on
a
losing
strain
Winning
campaigns
are
built
on
love
This
is
the
time
for
McCain
is
the
answer
not
The
other
guy
is
questionable
One
thing
McCain
has
going
for
him
a
big
arrow
in
his
quiver
is
this
In
a
time
of
crisis
do
you
really
want
one
party
to
control
the
entire
government
Don't
you
want
one
party
controlling
one
power
center
and
one
in
charge
of
the
other
with
each
side
tempering
the
other's
worst
impulses
With
regard
to
the
continuing
saga
of
our
vice
presidential
candidates
I
think
it
was
a
strategic
mistake
to
send
Sarah
Palin
out
on
the
stump
as
warrior
girl
Mr
McCain
is
war-y
enough
It
would
have
been
better
if
she
had
been
and
seemed
a
social
conservative
who
is
for
diplomacy
for
an
easy-does-it
approach
to
foreign
affairs
Instead
she
has
seemed
martial
speaking
breezily
in
interviews
of
war
with
Russia
or
an
attack
on
Iran
They
forget
Americans
don't
like
war
We
fight
it
well
but
don't
like
it
especially
in
times
of
economic
stress
It
continues
to
be
true
that
nobody
really
cares
what
Joe
Biden
says
He
could
announce
his
hairdo
is
going
to
war
with
Mrs
Palin's
hairdo
on
the
fields
of
Agincourt
and
no
one
would
pay
attention
That
is
because
he
is
a
known
quantity
Everyone
who's
followed
politics
at
all
in
the
past
30
years
has
a
sense
of
him
and
his
politics
Mrs
Palin
is
still
new
to
the
scene
as
is
Mr
Obama
Both
campaigns
in
the
closing
stretch
seem
not
fully
worthy
of
the
moment
We
are
in
crisis
a
once-in-a-century
event
as
we
now
say
And
what
we
got
from
the
candidates
in
this
week's
presidential
debate
was
a
bunch
of
gummy
meanderings
smooth
rounded
sentences
so
full
of
focus-grouped
inanities
that
six
minutes
in
viewers
entered
a
kind
of
trance
in
which
we
almost
immediately
gave
up
on
trying
to
wrest
meaning
from
what
was
being
said
and
instead
focused
on
mere
impressions
The
look
of
things
The
men
on
the
plane
the
pseudo-tough
political
operatives
who
surround
both
candidates
sometimes
grouse
in
private
that
it's
all
symbols
now
all
mood
all
about
the
visual
But
they
have
some
real
responsibility
here
They
send
their
candidates
out
to
speak
such
thin
gruel
such
spat-out
porridge
that
we
are
struck
dumb
and
left
daydreaming
about
the
fact
that
Mr
Obama's
suits
are
always
slate
gray
and
never
seem
to
wrinkle
and
Mr
McCain
tonight
seems
like
a
rabbity
forest
creature
darting
amid
the
hedgerows
As
to
what
they
will
do
about
the
crisis
Mr
Obama
will
raise
taxes
on
the
rich
and
help
us
weatherize
our
homes
while
Mr
McCain
favors
energy
independence
and
buying
up
mortgages
On
the
causes
of
the
crisis
they
spoke
of
insufficient
regulation
or
high
spending
But
these
were
not
the
great
causes
Neither
party
has
clean
hands
Or
rather
both
parties
have
dirty
hands
Here
is
the
truth
spoken
by
the
increasingly
impressive
Sen
Tom
Coburn
The
root
of
the
problem
is
political
greed
in
Congress
Members
from
both
parties
wanted
short-term
political
credit
for
promoting
homeownership
even
though
they
were
putting
our
entire
economy
at
risk
by
encouraging
people
to
buy
homes
they
couldn't
afford
Then
instead
of
conducting
thorough
oversight
and
correcting
obvious
problems
with
unstable
entities
like
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
members
of
Congress
chose
to
distract
themselves
with
unprecedented
amounts
of
pork-barrel
spending
That
is
the
truth
And
yet
at
the
debate
when
one
citizen-questioner
invited
both
candidates
to
think
aloud
about
the
responsibility
of
our
representatives
in
Washington
they
both
gently
suggested
she
was
cynical
She
was
not
cynical
She
was
informed
Why
would
anyone
trust
either
candidate
to
help
dig
us
out
of
this
if
they
can't
speak
frankly
about
what
got
us
into
it
One
had
the
sense
this
week
that
our
entire
political
class
is
playing
Frisbee
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
that
no
one
is
being
serious
enough
honest
enough
that
it's
all
too
revved
too
intense
and
yet
too
shallow
I
have
grown
impatient
with
the
strategists
from
the
campaigns
the
little
blond
monsters
who
go
on
cable
TV
to
give
us
their
bouncy
aggressive
tendentious
talking
points
They
are
like
the
men
on
the
plane
the
gargoyles
with
BlackBerrys
who
think
the
race
is
about
them
and
their
personal
win/loss
ratio
who
think
history
is
their
plaything
who
stay
up
with
the
press
in
the
bar
sipping
Perrier
and
calling
it
seltzer
and
who
advise
their
candidates
in
essence
to
talk
down
to
the
voters
to
the
American
people
They
treat
every
crisis
as
if
it
is
a
political
fact
to
be
used
for
gain
or
loss
and
not
as
a
real
crisis
something
that
deserves
a
response
of
gravity
and
seriousness
It
is
asking
a
lot
to
ask
a
political
animal
to
be
thoughtful
because
they
find
meaning
in
action
They
are
propelled
through
life
by
the
force
of
their
hunger
But
now
and
then
you
want
to
see
them
think
You
want
to
see
them
speak
the
truth
This
is
one
of
those
times

How
McCain
Can
Still
Win
Hell
if
the
great
historian
Professor
Hanson
says
so
I'm
buying
Yet
for
all
the
gloom
there
are
several
reasons
why
this
race
is
by
no
means
over
First
it
is
not
clear
that
panic
hysteria
and
the
Great
Depression
will
continue
to
be
the
headlines
and
lead-ins
each
night
for
the
next
three
weeks
We
may
be
soon
reaching
a
bottom
in
the
stock
market
Sometime
in
the
next
few
days
wiser
investors
should
see
that
trillions
of
global
dollars
are
now
piling
up
and
could
begin
to
prime
the
economy
and
that
still
valuable
stocks
for
a
brief
period
are
up
for
sale
at
once-in-a-lifetime
bargains
With
the
sudden
collapse
of
oil
prices
the
West
has
been
given
a
staggering
reprieve
of
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
in
savings
on
its
imported
fuel
bills
That
economy
too
will
result
in
more
liquidity
at
home
Given
the
shameless
behavior
of
Wall
Street
and
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
it
will
be
unlikely
that
we
will
revert
soon
to
the
Wild
West
speculation
that
had
for
the
last
six
years
transformed
the
once
pedestrian
notion
of
seeing
a
house
as
a
home
and
refashioned
it
into
either
a
politically
correct
entitlement
or
a
Las
Vegas
poker
chip
to
be
thrown
down
on
the
roulette
table
It
is
still
possible
that
by
the
week
before
the
election
there
will
be
a
sense
of
respite
rather
than
continued
anger
and
panic
and
any
day
in
which
hysteria
is
not
the
topic
of
the
day
benefits
McCain
In
this
regard
McCain
must
keep
reminding
in
simple
fashion
that
Freddie
and
Fannie
were
catalysts
that
drew
in
the
Wall
Street
sharks
crooked
officials
cooked
the
books
to
get
mega-bonuses
they
got
away
with
their
crimes
by
lavishing
money
on
mostly
Democratic
legislators
including
Obama
and
hand-in-glove
they
all
covered
and
still
are
covering
their
tracks
under
a
reprehensible
politically
correct
cynicism
Iraq
is
no
longer
the
contentious
issue
of
the
primaries
where
Democratic
candidates
outdid
each
other
in
predicting
failure
but
mirabile
dictu
turning
out
to
be
a
clear
American
victory
No
one
can
now
believe
that
withdrawal
by
March
2008
as
Sen
Obama
once
advocated
would
have
been
anything
but
an
utter
calamity
McCain
needs
to
continue
to
emphasize
the
dire
consequences
of
accepting
such
a
defeat
The
military
is
not
broken
but
now
the
most
experienced
battle-hardened
force
in
the
world
Iraq
is
not
as
Joe
Biden
once
demanded
trisected
into
feuding
fiefdoms
but
an
emerging
consensual
state
The
more
Iraq
is
out
of
the
news
the
more
the
growing
public
acceptance
that
it
is
becoming
a
success
McCain
should
continue
to
ask
Did
Americans
want
victory
in
November
2008
or
defeat
in
March
2008
The
Ayers
controversy
is
cited
by
the
in-the-tank
media
as
signs
of
McCain's
desperation
Perhaps
But
amid
the
tsk-tsking
there
are
also
certain
deer-in-the-headlights
moments
among
Obama's
handlers
Why
There
are
simply
too
many
ACORNs
Ayers
Khalidis
Pflegers
Wrights
et
al
not
to
suggest
a
pattern
unbecoming
of
a
future
President
of
the
United
States
Obama's
past
statements
about
his
relationship
with
Ayers
and
others
simply
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
factual
circumstances
of
their
long
association
McCain
must
focus
on
Ayers
between
2001
2005
Then
in
the
climate
of
national
worry
following
9/11
Ayers
was
on
recent
record
as
lamenting
that
he
had
not
set
off
enough
bombs
and
yet
until
2005
still
in
contact
with
Obama
about
what
and
why
voters
might
wish
to
know
When
Iraq
and
Wall
Street
were
off
the
front
page
Obama
went
moribund
in
the
last
months
of
the
Democratic
primary
Why
Not
because
of
racism
or
even
public
weariness
with
Obama's
hope
and
change
fluff
or
his
flip-flops
or
occasional
striking
ignorance
about
basic
history
and
geography
He
finally
began
to
wear
on
the
public
as
he
continues
to
when
events
of
the
day
do
not
smother
the
attention
of
the
voter
for
two
reasons
First
the
public
tires
of
all
the
media
slant
the
celebrity
rants
and
the
shills
in
popular
culture
that
in
concert
hourly
berate
beg
threaten
and
ridicule
voters
on
behalf
of
Obama
We
are
supposed
to
accept
Obama's
apotheosis
replete
with
Latinate
seal
Greek
columns
biblical
injunctions
about
the
seas
and
atmosphere
and
prophesies
that
he
is
The
One
whom
we
have
been
waiting
for
The
creepy
effect
of
ordering
us
to
accept
our
own
salvation
becomes
cumulative
So
there
is
a
quiet
unease
among
the
voters
as
there
always
is
in
America
when
someone
finger-points
and
lectures
them
what
they
must
do
or
else
Second
for
all
the
two
years
of
nonstop
campaigning
Obama
somehow
still
remains
an
unknown
and
for
apparently
good
reason
He
has
almost
no
record
in
the
Senate
to
speak
of
other
than
one
as
America's
most
predictably
partisan
and
liberal
Senator
What
is
known
of
his
Chicago
associates
is
not
reassuring
and
so
the
only
defense
can
be
silence
rather
than
exegesis
No
one
knows
anything
of
his
record
at
Columbia
University
how
he
got
into
Harvard
Law
School
or
what
he
was
doing
until
he
reached
Harvard
or
exactly
what
he
did
as
a
community
organizer
in
Chicago
or
how
a
person
with
no
record
of
legal
scholarship
was
about
to
be
offered
tenure
at
the
Chicago
Law
School
Each
doubt
in
and
of
itself
is
of
little
import
but
again
in
aggregate
even
the
generalities
make
voters
uneasy
especially
when
they
hear
of
fraud
among
voter
registration
drives
swarming
radio
stations
to
stifle
those
critical
of
Obama
and
threatened
lawsuits
to
yank
pro-McCain
ads.Read

Obama
Caught
covering
up
its
Lies
about
his
ACORN
Involvement
From
today's
Cleveland
Leader
On
Thursday
we
revealed
the
connection
between
Barack
Obama
and
Association
of
Community
Organizations
for
Reform
Now
ACORN
and
uncovered
a
2004
article
that
discussed
his
involvement
with
the
organization
which
had
recently
been
removed
from
the
web
Today
the
cover-ups
continue
and
language
on
Obama's
fightthesmears.com
website
has
been
altered
in
order
to
make
it
look
like
he
has
been
telling
the
truth
about
his
ACORN
associations
all
along
Fortunately
we
and
many
others
online
know
how
to
do
a
screen
capture
and
how
to
use
a
little
something
called
Google
Cache
As
of
yesterday
Fightthesmears.com
stated
Fact
Barack
was
never
an
ACORN
trainer
and
never
worked
for
ACORN
in
any
other
capacity
Sometime
on
Friday
the
website
was
altered
and
the
text
was
changed
to
state
Fact
ACORN
never
hired
Obama
as
a
trainer
organizer
or
any
type
of
employee
The
mere
fact
that
his
campaign
has
now
changed
the
language
of
the
site
shows
that
they
have
conceded
the
fact
that
their
original
remark
was
a
bold-face
lie
As
a
lawyer
Sen
Obama
should
know
the
importance
of
language
The
original
statement
implied
that
he
had
no
working
connection
with
ACORN
whereas
the
new
statement
now
insists
that
he
has
never
been
employed
or
hired
by
ACORN
It
is
good
to
see
the
truth
finally
come
out
now
but
why
were
they
trying
to
hide
his
association
with
ACORN
and
what
else
is
Obama
lying
to
us
about
Perhaps
the
biggest
question
now
is
how
and
why
they
got
the
Social
Policy
article
stricken
from
most
of
the

in

are

More
from
Aussie
Infadel
at
LGF
Wikileaks.org
has
an
article
from
the
Winter
2003
edition
of
the
magazine
Social
Policy
the
full
article
is
here
but
requires
registration
making
it
very
clear
that
Barack
Obama's
ties
to
ACORN
are
extensive

Now
Obama
started
building
the
base
years
before
For
instance
ACORN
noticed
him
when
he
was
organizing
on
the
far
south
side
of
the
city
with
the
Developing
Communities
Project
He
was
a
very
good
organizer
When
he
returned
from
law
school
we
asked
him
to
help
us
with
a
lawsuit
to
challenge
the
state
of
Illinois
refusal
to
abide
by
the
National
Voting
Rights
Act
also
known
as
motor
voter
Allied
only
with
the
state
of
Mississippi
Illinois
had
been
refusing
to
allow
mass-based
voter
registration
according
to
the
new
law
Obama
took
the
case
known
as
ACORN
vs
Edgar
the
name
of
the
Republican
governor
at
the
time
and
we
won
Obama
then
went
on
to
run
a
voter
registration
project
with
Project
VOTE
in
1992
that
made
it
possible
for
Carol
Moseley
Braun
to
win
the
Senate
that
year
Project
VOTE
delivered
50,000
newly
registered
voters
in
that
campaign
ACORN
delivered
about
5000
of
them
Since
then
we
have
invited
Obama
to
our
leadership
training
sessions
to
run
the
session
on
power
every
year
and
as
a
result
many
of
our
newly
developing
leaders
got
to
know
him
before
he
ever
ran
for
office
Thus
it
was
natural
for
many
of
us
to
be
active
volunteers
in
his
first
campaign
for
STate
Senate
and
then
his
failed
bid
for
U.S
Congress
in
1996
By
the
time
he
ran
for
U.S
Senate
we
were
old
friends
So
much
scandal
and
so
many
lies
so
little
time

Defending
ACORN
Are
they
not
simply
trying
to
make
Elections
Fair
for
all
As
I
was
walking
in
Fair
Park
after
yesterday's
Texas-Oklahoma
game
it
was
as
if
a
sudden
bolt
of
lightning
had
stunned
me
in
my
tracks
Suddenly
I
made
a
decision
I
asked
Barack
Obama
to
be
my
personal
Savior
I
opened
my
heart
to
the
will
of
Obama--and
voila
I
could
feel
the
spirit
rising
within
me
And
suddenly
the
world
was
a
different
place
What
had
I
been
thinking
And
so--as
a
revealation
from
the
will
of
O"--I
want
to
offer
the
following
explanation
where
before
there
had
only
been
confusion
All
of
these
evil
right-wing
fascists
are
going
to
try
and
tell
you--as
you
wade
through
all
of
these
ACORN
stories--that
it
is
your
tax
dollars
who
are
funding
these
criminals
and
they
will
then
try
to
reveal
which
party
steered
your
money
there--who
cares
Of
course
given
that
your
tax
revenue
also
helped
to
ensure
that
billions
in
unsecured
subprime
loans
were
steered
to
the
disadvantaged
is
it
so
much
of
a
stretch
that
the
same
Democrats
who
refused
to
regulate
Freddie
and
Frannie
also
rightly
desire
that
the
disadvantaged
would
have
a
progressive
advantage
in
percentage
of
votes
Of
course
they
should
have
Ergo
we
have
ACORN
Yet
the
evil
Republicans
are
trying
say
this
is
unfair--like
they
would
know
about
fairness
Personally
speaking
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
there
are
Democrats
who
care
enough
about
fairness
to
want
to
give
the
disadvantaged
more
of
a
say
than
taxpayers
like
me
have
in
who
gets
elected
or
even
non-citizens
after
all
if
I
am
contributing
more
to
our
economy
than
someone
less
fortunate
than
I
why
should
that
entitle
my
vote
to
be
counted
equally
with
the
vote
of
the
person
who
contributes
less
to
our
society
and
economy
Is
that
fair
Isn't
it
well
downright
regressive
So
why
should
all
these
evil
Republicans
get
so
bent
out
of
shape
and
to
say
all
those
terrible
things
about
ACORN
such
as
they
are
trying
to
steal
the
election
Have
they
no
respect
for
fairness
Consider
for
example
this
story
from
The
New
York
Post
h/t
Glenn
Reynolds
O'jahnae
Smith
is
ready
and
registered
to
vote
this
November
There's
only
one
problem
She's
7
years
old
The
Connecticut
girl
is
11
years
too
young
and
nobody
in
her
family
knows
how
she
ended
up
on
a
voter
registration
form
submitted
by
ACORN
the
Association
of
Community
Organizations
for
Reform
Now
She's
registered
to
vote
said
a
surprised
Jerome
Smith
O'jahnae's
teenage
brother
She's
too
young
to
vote
But
that
didn't
stop
someone
from
forging
the
child's
signature
on
a
voter
registration
card
and
giving
her
a
fake
birth
date
that
upped
her
age
to
27
The
family
told
The
Post
a
drug-addicted
relative
may
have
given
the
bogus
card
to
ACORN
Voter
registration
fraud
complaints
like
these
continue
to
mount
for
the
group
already
under
scrutiny
in
11
states
where
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
new
registrations
are
being
questioned
ACORN
volunteers
have
been
found
to
register
dead
people
and
even
put
members
of
the
Dallas
Cowboys
on
Nevada
lists
The
community
organizing
group
has
a
long
history
of
flooding
low
and
middle-income
neighborhoods
in
election
years
with
temporary
workers
instructed
to
register
20
to
25
voters
per
day
or
risk
getting
fired
Most
states
prohibit
paying
per
signature
but
ACORN
workers
earning
8
to
9
an
hour
still
have
to
hit
their
quotas
And
many
need
the
money
including
some
ex-cons
in
work-release
programs
ACORN's
controversial
tactics
have
fueled
John
McCain's
criticism
of
Barack
Obama
whose
campaign
paid
an
ACORN
spinoff
Community
Services
Inc
about
800,000
to
knock
on
doors
and
urge
people
to
vote
for
Obama
in
four
key
primary
states
Indiana
Ohio
Pennsylvania
and
Texas
In
his
pre-politics
days
Obama
ran
the
Illinois
chapter
of
Project
Vote
in
1992
before
it
hooked
up
with
ACORN
McCain
campaign
manager
Rick
Davis
on
Friday
called
for
a
freeze
on
taxpayer
dollars
to
ACORN
until
recent
allegations
have
been
investigated
Isn't
it
only
fair
that
a
7-year
old
from
a
poor
neighborhood
be
granted
the
same
right
to
vote
as
some
rich
fat-cat
Republican
Oil
company
executive
who
actually
meets
voting-age
requirements
He
makes
millions--and
he
plays
GOLF
of
all
things--yet
his
vote
should
count
more
than
this
precious
little
7
year-old
girl's
Where
is
our
sense
of
justice
Is
it
fair
that
stories
like
this
continue
to
appear
in
American
newspapers
Shouldn't
such
hate
speech
be
heavily-regulated--as
many
on
the
Left
have
suggested--in
the
name
of
fairness
ACORN
with
franchises
in
110
cities
has
been
accused
of
submitting
inaccurate
or
fraudulent
voter
registrations
in
at
least
nine
states
including
Ohio
and
Pennsylvania
Perjury
and
fraud
charges
are
being
weighed
in
Allegheny
County
In
2006
ACORN
signed
a
consent
decree
with
Washington
state
agreeing
to
refrain
from
improper
voter
registration
activities
or
face
criminal
prosecution
It's
no
secret
who
benefits
most
from
the
1.3
million
new
voters
ACORN
has
recently
registered
in
21
states
including
Pennsylvania
Expanding
voter
turnout
is
key
to
Democrats
electing
Mr
Obama
who
in
the
1990s
showered
ACORN's
Chicago
office
with
public-private
funding
he
controlled
and
provided
with
personal-leadership
training
But
ACORN
repeatedly
has
shown
it
can't
be
trusted
Are
its
new
voters
real
or
are
they
frauds
Are
they
ghosts
using
names
of
dead
people
or
former
Dallas
Cowboys
players
Are
they
duplicates
of
real
voters
Nevada's
office
of
Secretary
of
State
headed
by
a
Democrat
deserves
kudos
for
digging
into
ACORN's
operations
Given
the
scope
of
the
allegations
it's
now
time
for
federal
authorities
to
follow
the
states
lead
Oh
c'mon
now--don't
our
Federal
Authorities
have
more
important
things
to
investigate
like
companies
who
dare
to
make
a
profit
or
Republican
politicians
actions
in
public
restrooms
Open
plea
to
Mr
Soros
Mr
Axlerod
and
Senator
Obama
please
make
your
checks
out
to
The
Discerning
Texan
as
you
can
see
I
have
finally
seen
the
light
I
think
I
have
shown
here
that
I
finally
fully
understand
the
true
meaning
of
fairness
and
social
justice"--and
even
to
applying
those
high
moral
standards
to
our
living
and
breathing
Constitution
I
just
want
to
be
patriotic
like
Joe
Biden
was
saying
the
other
week
and
to
pay
more
taxes
But
I
am
nevertheless
hoping
that--given
my
change
of
heart
and
with
the
right
amount
of
incentives
from
your
fine
organizations
and
from
other
just
taxpayer-funded
Democrat
causes--that
I
can
be
helpful
towards
ushering
in
the
needed
transformation
of
the
obvious
right-wing
bias
of
our
news
media
Heil
Obama

The
Vibe
Masking
the
Black
Hole
of
Obammunism
Mark
Steyn
wrestles
with
the
McCain
campaign's
big
problem
which
is
how
best
to
expose
the
electorate
to
the
horrors
of
what
the
secretive
enigmatic
disingenuous
Obama
really
portends
for
our
country's
dangerously
precarious
moment
in
history
outside
of
someone
who
the
culture
has
pronounced
to
be
cool
Unfortunately
Steyn
seems
to
have
a
much
better
knack
for
articulating
the
mortal
danger
that
Obama
poses
than
does
McCain
emphasis
mine
The
day
after
the
debate
I
bumped
into
two
Obama
supporters
in
St
Johnsbury
Vermont
who
said
isn't
it
great
that
he's
on
course
to
win
Well
they
were
cute
chicks
and
I
know
an
obvious
pick-up
line
when
I
hear
one
so
I
stopped
to
chat
God
Almighty
it
was
like
reverse
Viagra
After
ten
minutes
of
Babes
For
Barack
I
never
want
to
meet
a
female
woman
of
the
opposite
sex
for
the
rest
of
my
life
Their
basic
pitch
was
How
do
you
solve
a
problem
Like
Obama
How
do
you
hold
a
moonbeam
in
your
hand
That's
John
McCain's
problem
Traditionally
when
an
unknown
politician
emerges
on
the
national
scene
it's
a
race
to
define
him
Governor
Palin
is
a
good
example
within
days
the
coastal
sophisticates
were
mocking
her
as
a
chillbilly
ditz
with
a
womb
that
spits
out
inbred
kids
faster
than
the
First
National
Bank
of
Welfare
Swamp
issues
subprime
mortgages
That's
politics
as
usual
Define
your
opponent
But
Obama
is
defined
by
his
indefinability
When
I
pointed
out
to
my
Vermont
gals
that
he
lives
in
a
swank
pad
that
was
part
of
some
shady
real
estate
deal
with
a
convicted
fraudster
Tony
Rezko
that
he
entrusted
his
daughters
entire
religious
education
to
a
neo-segregationist
anti-American
nut
who
preaches
that
the
government
created
the
AIDS
virus
to
kill
black
people
Jeremiah
Wright
that
he
attended
fundraisers
with
a
political
patron
who's
an
unrepentant
terrorist
proud
of
plotting
to
blow
up
young
ladies
just
like
them
at
a
dance
at
the
Fort
Dix
military
base
William
Ayers
when
I
pointed
all
this
out
they
looked
at
me
as
if
I'd
brought
a
baseball
bat
to
a
croquet
match
Mere
earthbound
politicians
are
defined
by
their
real
estate
deals
and
sleazy
buddies
but
Obama
is
defined
only
by
his
vibe
As
his
many
admirers
in
France
would
say
he
has
a
certain
je
ne
sais
quoi
And
if
you
try
to
pin
down
quoi
precisely
then
they
don't
want
to
sais
Besides
said
one
of
the
cuties
it's
racist
to
try
to
link
him
to
unsavory
white
men
Ayers
And
black
men
Wright
And
Arabs
Rezko
And
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
any
dodgy
Uzbeks
or
Papuans
who
might
have
been
lurking
around
the
greater
Chicago
area
for
the
last
quarter
century
The
ladies
weren't
exactly
covering
their
eyes
and
going
Neee-neeee-na-na
can't
hear
you
but
the
other
cutie
did
begin
waving
at
me
her
Obama
sticker
the
one
with
the
giant
blue-frosted
O
embedded
in
a
manicured
candy-striped
upland
like
the
villain
in
the
movie
trying
to
hypnotize
you
with
his
pocketwatch
I
began
frantically
looking
around
in
hopes
that
a
passing
Hare
Krishna
or
Scientologist
type
could
get
me
out
of
there
But
no
Gaze
into
the
giant
zero
of
the
Obama
logo
the
hole
in
the
star-spangled
donut
the
vast
fathomless
nullity
that
is
the
gaping
keyhole
to
the
door
of
utopia
To
a
sad
shriveled
Republican
cynic
there's
nothing
there
but
the
wide
open
spaces
of
Obama's
blank
resume
But
a
believer
will
see
therein
the
healing
of
the
planet
and
the
receding
of
the
oceans
The
black
hole
of
Obama
will
suck
you
in
through
the
awesome
power
of
its
totally
cool
suckiness
Most
Americans
of
course
are
not
cute
co-eds
or
Hollywood
celebrities
or
guilt-ridden
white
liberals
But
they
react
to
Obamania
like
Spencer
Tracy
and
Katherine
Hepburn
faced
with
Sidney
Poitier
in
Guess
Who's
Coming
To
The
Inaugural
We
don't
know
much
about
this
chap
but
he
seems
very
well-spoken
and
nicely
turned
out
articulate
and
bright
and
clean
as
Joe
Biden
said
Obama
himself
has
eased
up
on
the
I
am
the
one
you've
been
waiting
for
shtick
because
he's
running
out
the
clock
He
was
monumentally
boring
in
last
week's
debate
because
at
this
stage
boring
wins
The
man
who
used
to
say
he
doesn't
look
like
all
the
other
presidents
now
looks
like
all
the
other
presidents
the
calm
plausible
reassuring
man
in
the
sober
suit
This
is
no
time
to
frighten
the
horses
But
the
thing
is
the
horses
are
frightened
The
Dow's
nose-diving
stocks
are
looking
at
their
worst
year
since
1937
Last
Tuesday
we
were
offered
the
curious
spectacle
of
two
candidates
both
of
whom
essentially
take
the
same
line
on
this
stuff
Wall
Street
greed
special
interests
lobbyists
the
usual
populist
boilerplate
And
yet
for
a
pair
of
guys
who
both
believe
in
big-government
solutions
everything
they
said
seemed
small
and
tinny
Epic
events
swirled
all
around
but
the
two
men
fighting
to
lead
the
global
superpower
could
only
joust
with
cardboard
swords
Why
Obama
was
such
a
bold
leader
on
this
issue
that
only
two
years
ago
he
sent
a
letter
to
somebody
or
other
Why
long
before
Obama
sent
his
letter
McCain
issued
a
statement
Rarely
has
the
gulf
between
interesting
times
and
the
paperwork
of
big
government
yawned
so
widely
The
Republican
candidate's
tragedy
in
this
election
is
that
he's
chosen
to
fight
on
Obama
turf
to
share
so
many
of
his
assumptions
At
a
McCain
rally
in
Wisconsin
a
fellow
in
the
crowd
announced
he
was
mad
as
hell
and
got
a
standing
ovation
What
was
he
mad
about
Obama
Pelosi
and
the
socialists
taking
over
our
country
McCain
listened
politely
and
then
pledged
to
get
back
to
Washington
to
reach
across
the
aisle
to
work
on
some
gargantuan
bipartisan
cure-all
Not
the
answer
that
chap
wanted
to
hear
I'll
wager
If
the
more
frightening
polls
are
correct
America
is
about
to
elect
the
most
left-wing
government
in
history
an
Obama
Oval
Office
a
Pelosi
House
of
Representatives
a
filibuster-proof
Senate
and
a
year
or
two
down
the
road
maybe
three
new
Supreme
Court
justices
It
would

Watch
Ohio
Well
there's
news
breaking
tonight
and
it's
good
news
for
election
integrity
A
federal
district
court
judge
has
found
Democrat
Secretary
of
State
Jennifer
Brunner
guilty
of
violating
federal
election
laws
The
ruling
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
ACORN-centered
voter
fraud
epidemic
spreading
across
the
country
This
is
the
second
judgment
against
Brunner
Here's
the
press

the
Ohio
GOP
Court
Finds
Brunner
in
Violation
of
Federal
Law
Secretary

State
appeals
ruling
fights
effort
to
validate
registrations
Columbus
A
federal
court
ruled
tonight
that
Ohio
Secretary
of
State
Jennifer
Brunner
violated
federal
election
laws
by
not
taking
adequate
steps
to
validate
the
identity
of
newly
registered
voters
The
ruling
from
U.S
District
Court
Judge
George
C
Smith
called
the
identification
breakdown
a
serious
problem
and
ordered
Brunner
to
immediately
comply
with
federal
requirements
to
match
voter
registration
data
with
the
information
in
the
Ohio
Bureau
of
Motor
Vehicles
and
Social
Security
Administration
databases
The
court
accused
Brunner
of
failing
to
provide
county
election
administrators
with
an
effective
way
to
access
and
review
mismatches
She
immediately
appealed
the
ruling
For
some
reason
Jennifer
Brunner
does
not
want
these
new
registrations
checked
said
Ohio
Republican
Party
Deputy
Chairman
Kevin
DeWine
Her
refusal
to
comply
with
federal
law
raises
serious
concerns
about
her
ability
to
objectively
oversee
this
election
It's
especially
troubling
in
light
of
her
connection
to
ACORN
and
that
group's
stunning
confession
this
week
of
fraudulent
registration
activity
happening
right
here
in
Ohio
Brunner's
effort
to
fight
the
court
order
comes
just
two
days
after
the
Democrat
activist
group
ACORN
admitted
to
the
Cuyahoga
County
Board
of
Elections
that
the
group
engages
in
fraudulent
voter
registration
activity
Ohio
ACORN
officials
blamed
the
elections
board
for
not
scrutinizing
ACORN's
suspicious
cards
claiming
the
group
can't
be
expected
to
catch
everything
ACORN
is
facing
similar
inquires
in
other
Ohio
counties
as
well
as
10
other
states
Members
of
the
group's
voter-mobilization
arm
Project
Vote
regularly
advise
Brunner
on
election
strategy
even
recently
issuing
a
news
release
that
claims
credit
for
Brunner's
directive
restricting
challenges
to
suspected
fraudulent

Democrat

For

I'd

either
the

My

this

Both

require
that

be
compared
to
an
outside
independent

in

I'd
been

that
the
connection
between
the
Secretary
of

and
those

was
either
not
operation
or
had
been

of
ACORN's
admission
to
the

that
the

the

The

Nice
Anti-Semites

I
am
still
stunned
at
the
seeming
epidemic
of
suicidal
cluelessness
which
is
seemingly
so
widespread
in
this
country
far
be
it
for
the
media
to
overstate
Obama's
true
popularity
Voting
is
a
privilege
not

yet
most
Americans
seem
blissfully
unaware
that
their
votes
are
a
50/50
shot
to
be
rendered
worthless
should
the
Obammunists
win
It
is
quite
evident
that
they
are

foreign
money
massively
trying

rig
the
game
via
ACORN
and
their

just
imagine
what
they
can
rig
once
they

People
seem
to
think
that
things
cannot
get
any
worse
than
they
are
now
Right
Things
could
get
a

worse
and
not
just
economically
If
America
does
not
collectively
snap
out
of
it
and
wake
the
hell
up
from
this
nightmare
over
the
next
three
weeks
an
economic
crisis
of
confidence
could
quickly
become
an
existential
one
And
the
most
frightening
thing
is
that
Obama
just
the
guy
who
can
bring
about
that
outcome
worse
the
terminally
clueless
and
their

cheerleaders
seem
poised
to

In

states
ACORN
boasts

this

It
is
reasonable
to
ask
whether
ACORN
is
in
fact
a
criminal
conspiracy
to
subvert
the
voting
rights
of
Americans
Which
makes
it
all
the
more
remarkable
that
Barack
Obama
paid
ACORN
800,000
to
register
new
voters
and
then
lied
about
it
falsely
telling
the
Federal

Commission
that
the
800,000
went
to
a
group
called

Inc
for

work
Today
John

Whittle
on
Obama
and
the
Right
to
Health
Care
The
best
news
about
Bill
Whittle's
new
gig
with
NRO
is
that
it
forces
him
to
write
at
least
once
a
week
Here
is
his
latest
effort
What
is
a
Right
and
How
do
we
Know
emphasis
mine
During
the
presidential
debate
Tuesday
night
Barack
Obama
was
asked
if
he
thought
health
care
was
a
right
He
said
he
thought
it
was
a
right
Well
if
you
accept
that
premise
I
think
you
can
ask
some
logical
follow-up
questions
Food
is
more
important
than
health
care
You
die
pretty
quickly
without
food
Do
we
have
a
right
to
food
in
America
What
about
shelter
Do
we
have
a
right
to
housing
And
if
we
do
have
a
right
to
housing
what
standard
of
housing
do
we
have
a
right
to
And
if
it
is
a
right
due
to
all
Americans
wouldn't
that
mean
that
no
one
should
have
to
accept
any
housing
or
health
care
which
is
inferior
to
anyone
else's
since
it's
a
right
Do
we
have
a
right
to
be
safe
Do
we
have
a
right
to
be
comfortable
Do
we
have
a
right
to
wide-screen
televisions
Where
does
this
end
See
by
taking
something
to
a
ridiculous
extreme
we
can
illuminate
the
problem
here
what
is
a
right
How
do
we
know
What's
the
difference
between
the
right
to
free
speech
which
is
enshrined
in
the
Constitution
versus
the
right
to
health
care
which
is
not
Well
back
in
the
day
we
would
simply
say
that
a
right
has
legal
authority
it's
in
the
Constitution
and
therefore
it's
a
not
just
a
right
it's
a
birthright
So
why
shouldn't
we
amend
the
Constitution
to
include
the
rights
to
health
care
food
housing
education
all
the
rest
What's
the
difference
between
the
rights
we
have
and
the
rights
Obama
wants
to
give
us
Simply
this
Constitutional
rights
protect
us
from
things
intimidation
illegal
search
and
seizure
self-incrimination
and
so
on
The
revolutionary
idea
of
our
Founding
Fathers
was
that
people
had
a
God-given
right
to
live
as
they
saw
fit
Our
constitutional
rights
protect
us
from
the
power
of
government
But
these
new
so-called
rights
are
about
the
government
who
the
Founders
saw
as
the
enemy
giving
us
things
food
health
care
education
And
when
we
have
a
right
to
be
given
stuff
that
previously
we
had
to
work
for
then
there
is
no
reason
none
to
go
and
work
for
them
The
goody
bag
has
no
bottom
except
bankruptcy
and
ruin
Does
that
ring
a
little
familiar
these
days
Because
isn't
the
danger
here
that
if
you're
offered
something
for
nothing
you'll
take
it
Only
it's
not
something
for
nothing
Free
health-care
costs
us
something
precious
and
no
less
precious
for
being
invisible
Because
there's
a
word
for
someone
who
has
their
food
housing
and
care
provided
for
them
for
people
who
owe
their
existence
to
someone
else
And
that
word
is
slaves
We
are
closer
to
the
precipice
than
they
would
have
you
believe
This
is
by
far
the
most
consequential
and
dangerous
election
in
my
lifetime
maybe
in
the
entire
history
of
the
US

John
Hinderaker's
post
leaves
little
to
the

This

the
irresistible
force
meeting
the
immovable
object
The

pro-status
quo
anti-change
candidate
Barack
Obama
as
President
The
power
and
money
arrayed
behind
Obama
seem
unbeatable
At
the
same
time
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
American
people
would
elect
a
socialist
President
So
if
this
report
is
correct
something's
got
to

In
June
sources
released
information
that
during
his
campaign
for
the
State
Senate
in
Illinois
Barack
Obama
was
endorsed
by
an
organization
known
as
the
Chicago
New
Party
The
New
Party
was
a
political
party
established
by
the
Democratic
Socialists
of
America
the
DSA
to
push
forth
the
socialist
principles
of
the
DSA
by
focusing
on
winnable
elections
at
a
local
level
and
spreading
the
Socialist
movement
upwards
After
allegations
surfaced
in
early
summer
over
the
New
Party's
endorsement
of
Obama
the
Obama
campaign
along
with
the
remnants
of
the
New
Party
and
Democratic
Socialists
of
America
claimed
that
Obama
was
never
a
member
of
either
organization
The
DSA
and
New
Party
then
systematically
attempted
to
cover
up
any
ties
between
Obama
and
the
Socialist
Organizations
However
it
now
appears
that
Barack
Obama
was
indeed
a
certified
and
acknowledged
member
of
the
DSA's
New
Party
On
Tuesday
I
discovered
a
web
page
that
had
been
scrubbed
from
the
New
Party's
website
The
web
page
which
was
published
in
October
1996
was
an
internet
newsletter
update
on
that
years
congressional
races
Although
the
web
page
was
deleted
from
the
New
Party's
website
the
non-profit
Internet
Archive
Organization
had
archived
the
page
Here
it
is
So
the
New
Party
claimed
Obama
as
a
member

victory
New
Party
member
Barack
Obama
was
uncontested
for
a
State
Senate
seat
from
Chicago
The
Democratic
Socialist
Party
of
America
was
slightly
more
modest
in
claiming
Senator
Obama
as
an
adherent
Still
it
appears
clear
that
as
of
1996
the
New
Party
and
its
parent
organization
the
Democratic
Socialists
of
America
considered
Barack
Obama
to
be
their
guy--one
of
a
handful
of
avowed
socialists
running
for
office
at
any
level
in
the
United
States
It
strikes
me
that
Obama
has

Dan
Riehl
asks
Are
you
Connecting
the
Dots
As
I've
already
said
to
some
that
Obama
was
in
the
New
Party
isn't
new
But
keep
in
mind
the
ACORN
connection
I
pointed
out
back
in
May
then
connect
the
dot
some
seem
to
be
missing
ACORN
and
The
New
Party
were
somewhat
one
and
the
same
because
TNP
relied
on
ACORN
to
become
established
in
Chicago
After
a
false
start
in
New
York
the
New
Party
built
modestly
successful
chapters
in
several
states
Some
of
these
chapters
such
as
those
in
Chicago
and
Little
Rock
had
their
main
bases
of
support
in
the
low-income
community
organizing
group
ACORN
along
with
some
support
from
various
labor
unions
especially
ACORN-allied
locals
of
the
Service
Employees
International
Union
And
at
least
in
part
how
did
the
mighty
ACORN
grow
That
would
be
courtesy
of
Obama
and
Ayres
via
the
CAC
In
a
very
real
sense
Obama
took
foundation
monies
that
were
supposed
to
improve
education
failed
at
that
but
managed
to
establish
the
very
bedrock
of
Leftism
which
ultimately
lifted
him
to
his
first
elected
office
Sweet
deal
huh
Too
bad
it
did
nothing
at
all
for
the
children
it
was
supposed
to
help
So
to
whom
did
CAC's
money
go
CAC
translated
Mr
Ayers's
radicalism
into
practice
Instead
of
funding
schools
directly
it
required
schools
to
affiliate
with
external
partners
which
actually
got
the
money
Proposals
from
groups
focused
on
math/science
achievement
were
turned
down
Instead
CAC
disbursed
money
through
various
far-left
community
organizers
such
as
the
Association
of
Community
Organizations
for
Reform
Now
or
Acorn
And
then
there
is
this
from
Bob
Owens
Reader
Gus
Bailey
pointed
this
out
earlier
via
email
and
Ace
breaks
out
the
flaming
skull
I
don't
understand
what
the
big
deal
is
about
So
Barack
Obama
was
a
member
of
an
extremist
political
party
established
by
the
Democratic
Socialists
for
America
the
Chicago
New
Party
and
they
cheered
his
victory
in
his
uncontested
run
for
his
Illinois
state
senate
seat
as
a
step
away
from
American
values
towards
socialism
Does
it
really
matter
Barack
Obama's
most
direct
political
godfather
is
a
bomb-building
terrorist
still
bent
on
undermining
capitalism
His
hostess
for
his
first
political
fundraiser
was
once
labeled
the
most
dangerous
woman
in
America
and
is
a
fan
of
how
the
Charles
Manson
family
murdered
their
victims
Barack
Obama's
cultish
church
of
21
years
is
built
upon
a
combination
of
Black
Panther
rhetoric
racism
against
whites
and
a
Marxist
Jesus
Christ
If
his
pastor
and
mentor
Jeremiah
Wright
had
not
shrieked
God
damn
America
and
had
not
tried
to
blame
the
AIDS
virus
on
a
government
attempt
at
genocide
against
African
Americans
Barack
Obama
would
still
being
going
to
that
church
Barack
Obama
laundered
millions
of
dollars
in
education
funds
to
extremist
groups
in
an
attempt
to
indoctrinate
children
instead
of
educate
them
Barack
Obama
while
a
member
of
the
Joyce
Foundation
attempted
to
undermine
the
integrity
of
legal
scholarship
in
a
shadowy
attempt
to
subvert
the
Constitution
and
imperil
the
Second
Amendment
by
conning
the
Supreme
Court
Folks
if
being
deeply
associated
with
terrorist
leaders
and
racists
for
more
than
two
decades
doesn't
cause
disgust
in
American
voters
if
they
don't
care
how
Obama
funneled
grant
money
to
extremists
and
tried
to
undermine
the
Constitution
will
his
membership
in
a
political
party
that
seeks
to
undermine
the
America
way
of
life
really
stand
a
chance
of
changing
their
minds
Owens
is
right
this
sort
of
thing
would
have
been
on
every
front
page
in
America
20
years
ago
today
the
media
merely
yawns
and
ignores
it

Dispensing
with
the
whole
When
did
Obama
know
about
Ayers
meme
Lots
of
good
material
from
The
Corner
today
As
usual
OK
let's
dispense
with
the
pretense
of
course
Obama
is
lying
about
when
he
and
Ayers
met
more
background
here
No
person--even
an
unrepentant
60's
Marxist
terrorist--entrusts
more
than
50
million
of
trust
money
to
someone
he
does
not
know
and/or
agree
with
If
Ayers
does
not
see
Obama
as
a
Comrade
in
the
cause
Obama
does
not
get
that
job
Period
Not
to
mention
Ayers
hosting
a
campaign
event
at
his
house
for
Obama
Clearly
this
was
not
just
someone
who
Barack
ran
into
in
the
hood
And
for
Obama
to
claim
he
did
not
know
Ayers
history
is
as
stupefying
as
his
claim
that
he
sat
in
Trinity
Church
for
20
years
and
did
not
have
a
clue
about
what
the
good
Rev
Wright
was
about--anti-Seimitism
and
all
But--as
Victor
Davis
Hanson
so
artfully
points
out--it
should
not
even
matter
when
they
first
met
emphasis
mine
He
Obama
said
they
have
not
spoken
by
phone
or
exchanged
e-mail
messages
since
Mr
Obama
began
serving
in
the
United
States
Senate
in
January
2005
New
York
Times
10/3
Why
in
the
world
was
Barack
Obama
still
communicating
on
the
phone
or
via
email
with
Bill
Ayers
up
until
2005
when
in
2001
Ayers
gave
widely
publicized
interviews
claiming
he
had
no
regrets
about
the
bombing
indeed
regretted
that
he
had
not
done
enough
and
did
not
necessarily
have
any
remorse
either
about
his
Weathermen
career
Ponder
that
the
possible
next
President
of
the
United
States
well
after
9/11
and
in
the
climate
of
hourly
worry
over
terrorism
here
at
home
was
still
friendly
and
communicating
with
an
associate
that
had
to
abandon
his
book
tour
due
to
popular
outcry
and
was
widely
quoted
as
absolutely
unrepentant
about
his
terrorism
That
is
a
damning
indictment
of
his
judgement
among
other
things
and
it
is
no
smear
to
raise
the
issue
Indeed
there
is
a
disturbing
pattern
here
Obama's
once-close
radical
Chicago
associates
are
never
jettisoned
out
of
principle
but
only
at
the
11th-hour
when
they
became
impediments
to
Obama's
political
career
Thus
Wright
is
defended
throughout
his
racist
rantings
until
he
makes
the
unfortunate
decision
of
bringing
that
hatred
to
DC's
elite
nexus
at
the
National
Press
Club
and
only
then
is
immediately
dropped
as
Obama
resigns
from
Trinity
Church
Ditto
Ayers
What
made
Obama
cease
communciations
with
Ayers
was
not
the
latter's
radicalism
indeed
Obama
facilitated
it
by
serving
with
Ayers
to
dispense
millions
to
questionable
organizations
nor
even
Ayers
boasts
in
2001
of
having
no
regrets
about
trying
to
blow
up
government
buildings
Instead
2005
coincides
with
Obama's
ascension
to
the
Senate
and
the
plan
to
begin
running
for
the
Presidency
and
thus
Ayers
like
Wright
later
became
expendable
Ditto
Rezko
Pfleger
et
al.Meanwhile
Stanley
Kurtz
illuminates
the
Obama's
cover-up
with
the
perpetually-corrupt
ACORN
read
the
whole
thing
Barack
Obama
is
now
apparently
denying
his
ties
with
Acorn
Here's
what
he's
posted
on
the
subject
at
his
Fight
the
Smears
website
These
claims
are
contradicted
by
several
sources
a
number
of
which
I
linked
to
in
my
piece
Inside
Obama's
Acorn
In
that
piece
you'll
find
a
link
to
a
Los
Angeles
Times
piece
in
which
Chicago
Acorn
leader
Madeline
Talbott
is
described
as
so
impressed
with
Obama
that
she
invited
him
to
help
train
her
staff
You'll
also
see
a
link
to
a
statement
by
Obama
himself
made
in
pursuit
of
Acorn's
endorsement
Obama
says
I've
been
fighting
alongside
ACORN
on
issues
you
care
about
my
entire
career
Even
before
I
was
an
elected
official
when
I
ran
Project
Vote
voter
registration
drive
in
Illinois
ACORN
was
smack
dab
in
the
middle
of
it
and
we
appreciate
your
work
In
my
piece
No
Liberation
you'll
find
a
link
to
a
1995
profile
of
Obama
which
says
Obama
continues
his
organizing
work
largely
through
classes
for
future
leaders
identified
by
ACORN
and
the
Centers
for
New
Horizons
on
the
south
side
My
articles
provide
background
but
the
quotes
and
links
I've
presented
here
and
in
the
past
pretty
conclusively
contradict
Obama's
current
claims
at
Fight
the
Smears
Perhaps
the
strongest
evidence
against
Obama's
attempt
to
deny
his
ties
to
Acorn
comes
in
an
article
by
Toni
Foulkes
a
Chicago
Acorn
leader
and
a
member
of
Acorn's
National
Association
Board
in
the
journal
Social

article

I

in

piece
As
I've
just
been
informed
by
a
reader
however
the
journal
Social

appears
to
have
pulled
the
link
to
that
article
rendering
it
inaccessible
even
by
purchase
You
can
find
the
apparently
pulled
link
here
A
link
to
a
second
article
also
appears
to
have
been
pulled
here
I
was
previously
unaware
of
this
second
article
Towards
a
Chicago
School
of
Youth
Organizing
by
Alyson
Parham
and
Jeff
Pinzino
I
would
strongly
suggest
that
people
try
to
find
this
article
in
hard
copy
at
a
library
What
is
it
about
Obama
and
libraries
Peter
Kirsanow
makes
the
case
for
why
McCain
must
hit
Obama
hard
about
the
Ayers
association--and
hard
Andy
McCarthy's
right
that
it's
imperative
to
attack
the
premise
that
Obama's
a
plausible
president
Obama
consorted
with
a
terrorist
who
brags
about
planting
bombs
and
whose
organization
planted
hundreds
of
bombs
Some
were
meant
to
kill
cops
Some
were
meant
to
kill
soldiers
Some
were
meant
to
kill
civilians
Let's
put
this
quite
simply
This
is
an
abomination
This
alone
disqualifies
Obama
from
being
president
Even
if
he
can
heal
the
planet
Even
if
the
Dow
tanks
to
5000
Even
if
he
puts
a
unicorn
in
every
garage
A
majority
of
Americans
will
not
vote
for
a
candidate
who
they
know
has
had
a
working
relationship
with
a
terrorist
foreign
or
domestic
But
they
must
know
it
Americans
haven't
suddenly
become
so
tolerant
of
terrorism
and
those
who
are
tolerant
of
terrorists
that
we'll
vote
for
a
smooth
glib
empty
suit
because
we
hope
that
somehow
he'll
work
some
form
of
alchemy
on
a
scary
economy
This
is
not
rocket
science
The
facts
must
be
presented
Clearly
concisely
repeatedly
They
haven't
been
I'll
leave
it
to
the
pros
to
figure
out
how
to
make
this
register
given
the
economy
But
I
think
Jim
Geraghty's
idea
of
having
an
event
at
Ft
Dix
should
at
least
start
the
discussion.Faster

out
of

Atrocious
I
thought
there
was
going
to
be
some
real
back
and
forth
tonight
unscripted
and
unrehearsed
Instead
Brokaw
turned
it
into
an
Obama
dream
set-up
every
answer
a
scripted
answer
Once
again
NBC
demonstrates
just
how
far
gone
it
is
as
an
objective
news
organization
That's
a
lobby
group
I
can
get
behind
Mark
Levin's
point
that
McCain
doesn't
flat-out
lie
the
way
Obama
does
is
a
way
of
acknowledging
that
the
stilted
artificial
formats
of
these
debates
principally
benefits
the
Democrat
Most
electoral
seasons
the
Democrat
candidate
has
to
pass
himself
off
as
something
other
than
what
his
record
would
suggest
tough
on
foreign
policy
issues
deeply
personally
passionately
personally
anguished
on
abortion
etc
These
stilted
non-debates
assist
the
Dem
in
getting
away
with
it
Mixing
it
up
direct
challenges
between
candidates
etc
would
not
only
make
for
better
viewing
but
diminish
this
season's
Democratic
northern
liberal
from
passing
himself
off
as
a
moderate
centrist
champing
at
the
bit
to
kill
bin
Laden
and
destroy
al-Qaeda
As
for
the

format
no
self-respecting

recognize
anything

genuine
New

Town
Meeting

Meanwhile
And
another

take
the

off
and

directly
with

gone
All

needed

draw
it

me

Or
else
our

is
going
to
go

Obama
Too
Radical
Even
for
George
McGovern
Via
Gateway
Pundit
a
VERY
interesting
tidbit
that
the
networks
are
NOT
covering
go
figure
The
Employee
Free
Choice
Act
is
a
very
radical
piece
of
legislation
and
Barack
Obama
supports
it
It
takes
away
an
employee's
democratic
rights
In
fact
it's
so
radical
that
even
Former
Senator
George
McGovern
is
against
the
idea
He
even
opposed
it
in
an
ad
Tonight
during
the
presidential
debate
George
McGovern
will
describe
why
he's
against
taking
away
the
secret
ballot
for
union
organizing
elections
Here
is
that
60
second
ad
Too
radical
for
George
McGovern
That's
Barack
Obama
It
is
now
up
to
John
McCain
to
illustrate
the
true
radical
nature
of
Obama
The
media
isn't
going
to
do
it
Both
Andrew
McCarthy
and
the
Editors
of
NRO
are
in
full
agreement
We
could
lose
our
country
tonight
It
is
time
for
the
brass
knuckles
it
is
time
for
Sherman
to
march
to
the
Sea
This
is
endgame--no
prisoners
territory
McCain
not
only
needs
to
be
on
message
tonight--he
needs
to
be
mad

About

Obama
Barely
Even
Met
Ayers
and
Didn't
Even
Know
He
Was
a
Terrorist
Stanley
Kurtz
Everything
That
Guy
Just
Said
Is
Bullshit
Must
read
Just
came
out
Obama
distributed
millions
of
dollars
controlled
by
Ayers
to
radical
education
partners
such
as
ACORN
which
were
not
concerned
with
actual
learning
but
with
spreading
leftist
ideology
Um
has
anyone
you
barely
even
met
ever
hired
you
for
a
directorship
job
and
put
millions
of
dollars
into
your
hands
to
distribute
Sure
happens
every
day
Just
like
these
courtesy
of
Peter
Kirsanow
at
The
Corner
As
Mark
Levin
notes
below
Obama
presents
himself
as
mainstream
I
suspect
that
almost
every
Cornerite
could
make
each
of
the
following
statements
My
career
was
not
launched
with
the
assistance
of
an
unrepentant
terrorist
My
pastor
has
never
said
God
damn
America
I
don't
think
our
troops
are
just
air-raiding
villages
and
killing
civilians
My
spouse
doesn't
think
America
is
a
downright
mean
country
I've
never
sat
on
a
board
with
an
unrepentant
terrorist
I've
never
directed
millions
of
dollars
to
radical
organizations
I've
never
opposed
requiring
medical
care
for
babies
who
are
born
alive
I
bought
my
home
without
assistance
from
a
convicted
felon
I've
never
taken
my
kids
to
a
church
whose
pastor
thinks
AIDS
was
created
by
the
government
If
Obama's
mainstream
most
Americans
are
extremists
Here
is
the
Mark
Levin
take
Kirsanow
was
referring
to
Brilliant
as
usual
As
someone
who
has
written
critically
of
John
McCain
on
a
host
of
issues
including
the
Keating
Five
none
of
it
compares
to
the
life
that
Barack
Obama
has
led
and
his
belief
system
Obama
is
not
merely
associated
with
domestic
terrorists
Palestinian
radicals
Marxists
and
black
liberation
ideologues
he
was
their
favorite
candidate
They
groomed
him
They
befriended
him
He
befriended
them
He
socialized
with
them
In
other
words
these
people
saw
Obama
as
representing
their
views
and
aspirations
and
he
saw
them
the
same
way
I
am
not
among
those
who
raise
Obama's
associations
but
add
of
course
it
doesn't
mean
Obama
shares
their
views
Oh
really
These
miscreants
include
Obama's
former
pastor
political
mentors
and
allies
and
friends
Obama
attempts
to
downplay
and
distance
himself
from
his
own
circle
of
allies
now
that
he
is
running
for
president
But
he
is
one
of
them
Obama
is
getting
a
pass
that
no
other
candidate
in
my
memory
has
ever
received
If
John
McCain
had
belonged
to
a
church
for
20
years
and
that
church
advocated
white
supremacy
and
the
pastor
of
the
church
spewed
racist
propaganda
wrapped
in
Biblical
verses
much
of
which
was
caught
on
video-tape
what
would
we
say
If
McCain's
good
friends
included
people
involved
in
blowing
up
abortion
clinics
instead
of
the
Capitol
Building
the
Pentagon
and
police
stations
what
would
we
say
If
McCain
was
socially
close
to
a
professor
with
ties
to
neo-Nazi
groups
in
Berlin
as
opposed
to
a
professor
who
had
ties
to
the
PLO
what
would
we
say
If
McCain
spent
his
formative
years
schooled
in
fascism
as
opposed
to
Marxism
what
would
we
say
Every
time
Obama's
life
experiences
and
character
are
raised
the
response
is
a
diversionary
tactic
Today
we're
supposed
to
be
impressed
with
the
moral
equivalency
argument
Ayers
Keating
Five
or
Obama's
associations
and
friendships
aren't
what
they
appear
to
be
or
Obama
really
isn't
like
all
those
people
he
drew
around
him
or
those
raising
these
issues
are
guilty
of
McCarthyism
There
are
30
days
left
in
this
election
It's
high
time
the
Obama
fan-dance
ended.The
McCain
has
to
get
over
its
hysterical
case
of
white
guilt
and
expose
this
man
for
who
he
is
There
is
nothing
whatsoever
threatening
about
a
black
man
being
President
It
would
be
a
wonderful
thing
assuming
it
was
the
right
black
man
this
guy
ain't
it
Obama
would
likely
set
race
relations
back
decades
by
the
time
he's
done
ruining
our
country
Sorry

UPDATE
Jennifer

Man's
Con
Man
But
more
than
hypocrisy
is
at
work
here
It
is
not
just
far
Left
American-hating
radicals
he
now
disowns
You
get
the
sense
that
he
believes
everyone
can
be
played
Rashid

can
believe
that
Obama
finds
no
one
suffers
more
than
the
Palestinians
Jews
can
buy
that
he
was
moved
by
the
Holocaust
from
a
summer
camp
experience
Voters
in
his
Congressional
race
in
1990
can
be
told
that
there
is
no
difference
ideologically
between
him
and
100
ADA-rated
Bobby
Rush
but
the
rest
of
the
state
in
2004
and
eventually
the
country
can
buy
that
he's
a
post-partisan
reformer
Terrorists
come
to
believe
he
shares
their
scorn
for
America
but
Iowa
voters
hear
him
talk
about
his
appreciation
that
only
in
America
could
his
story
have
happened
Primary
voters
in
Ohio
are
coddled
with
protectionist
promises
and
then
privately
scorned
while
he
is
talking
to
San
Fransciso
liberal
donors
There
is
no
end
to
it
everyone
gets
the
version
of
Obama
that
perfectly
fits
his
own
world
view
It
is
not
hypocrisy
It's
fraud
Whatever
he
told
or
shared
with
Ayers
Dohrn
Wright
or
Pfleger
counts
for
no
more
that
what
he
told
or
shared
with
other
now
inconvenient
groups
and
individuals
He's
sold
the
same
piece
of
political
real
estate
to
multiple
buyers
for
multiple
conflicting
uses
But
one
thing
has
been
consistent
He
has
never
ever
attacked
political
corruption
whether
in
Chicago
or
Washington
To
the
contrary
at
the
Woods
Fund
the
Annenberg
Challenge
and
the
U.S
Senate
he's
laddled
out
earmarks
and
goodies
to
a
long
list
of
friends
and
associates
Wright
Pfleger
Will
County
home
of
FBI
target
Larry
Walsh
Allison
S
Davis
ACORN
etc
The
one
consistency
has
been
his
fidelity
to
political
supporters
Everyone
else
and
every
political
position
were
disposable
Now
is
precisely
the
time
for
firm
convictions
strict
ethical
propriety
and
the
firmness
to
turn
away
those
who
put
private
interests
above
the
public
good
We
may
be
on
the
verge
of
electing
a
candidate
who
lacks
any
of
these
traits

More
Advice
for
McCain
Be
RELENTLESS
in
your
Attacks
Lisa
Schiffren
has
got
her
pulse
on
a
strategy
that
can
pull
out
a
win--let's
hope
McCain
is
listening
Tactically
it
should
have
Sarah
Palin
and
surrogates
Giuliani
Gingrich
Romney
Pawlenty
Crist
and
Sanford
blast
away
from
a
few
different
angles
a
day
Have
the
articulate
ones
make
complete
coherent
cases
on
each
issue
Make
Barack
Obama
defend
himself
fill
in
the
mysterious
gaps
and
list
concrete
outcomes
from
his
work
We
shall
see
how
much
grace
he
brings
to
that
situation
Attack
hard
enough
to
make
the
American
people
pay
attention
Any
wavering
voter
should
know
the
reasons
that
a
vote
for
Obama
is
a
risk
and
they
should
know
what
it
guarantees
McCain
must
rise
to
this
moment
and
be
crystal
clear
about
his
future
economic
policy
And
it
has
to
be
good
Let
people
know
he
understand
the
pain
we
are
all
facing
together
Because
making
voters
wary
of
Obama
which
they
have
resisted
pretty
strenuously
heretofore
doesn't
get
them
to
the
polls
for
the
Republican
candidate
Here
are
ten
suggestions
for
the
campaign
1
The
economy
Democrats
are
blaming
the
current
crisis
the
one
requiring
the
now-$800
billion
bailout
on
McCain's
aversion
to
regulation
Explain
the
difference
between
more
regulations
and
useful
regulations
Explain
that
all
the
regulations
in
the
world
applied
to
financial
institutions
won't
help
if
government
policy
mandates
that
banks
issue
mortgages
to
people
who
can't
repay
them
Explain
who
wanted
so
badly
to
expand
homeownership
and
why
and
who
benefitted
from
the
work
of
Freddie
and
Fannie
List
the
top
three
recipients
of
Freddie
and
Fannie's
campaign
donations
That's
the
history
Here
is
the
abstract
point
to
move
to
Obama
and
his
allies
truly
deeply
believe
that
markets
are
bad
and
a
small
group
of
smart
good-hearted
people
them
should
be
running
things
The
smart
people
had
the
good
intentions
of
having
the
poor
own
homes
So
they
overrode
traditional
banking
norms
which
they
called
racist
Now
we
are
all
paying
for
their
leftist
ideology
For
a
real
fight
mention
the
Community
Reinvestment
Act
Ask
what
happens
in
the
near
future
when
the
A
team
Nancy
Pelosi
Harry
Reid
Charles
Rangel
Barney
Frank
and
Barack
Obama
are
in
charge
of
the
economy
during
the
coming
recession
Don't
sugar-coat
the
economic
situation
If
McCain
wins
he
presides
over
tough
times

He

emphases

Our
current
economic
crisis
is
a
good
case
in
point
What
was
his
actual
record
in
the
years
before
the
great
economic
crisis
of
our
lifetimes
This
crisis
started
in
our
housing
market
in
the
form
of
subprime
loans
that
were
pushed
on
people
who
could
not
afford
them
Bad
mortgages
were
being
backed
by
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
and
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
a
contagion
of
unsustainable
debt
began
to
spread
This
corruption
was
encouraged
by
Democrats
in
Congress
and
abetted
by
Senator
Obama
Senator
Obama
has
accused
me
of
opposing
regulation
to
avert
this
crisis
I
guess
he
believes
if
a
lie
is
big
enough
and
repeated
often
enough
it
will
be
believed
But
the
truth
is
I
was
the
one
who
called
at
the
time
for
tighter
restrictions
on
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
that
could
have
helped
prevent
this
crisis
from
happening
in
the
first
place
Senator
Obama
was
silent
on
the
regulation
of
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
and
his
Democratic
allies
in
Congress
opposed
every
effort
to
rein
them
in
As
recently
as
September
of
last
year
he
said
that
subprime
loans
had
been
quote
a
good
idea
Well
Senator
Obama
that
good
idea
has
now
plunged
this
country
into
the
worst
financial
crisis
since
the
Great
Depression
To
hear
him
talk
now
you'd
think
he'd
always
opposed
the
dangerous
practices
at
these
institutions
But
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
his
record
to
suggest
he
did
He
was
surely
familiar
with
the
people
who
were
creating
this
problem
The
executives
of
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
have
advised
him
and
he
has
taken
their
money
for
his
campaign
He
has
received
more
money
from
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
than
any
other
senator
in
history
with
the
exception
of
the
chairman
of
the
committee
overseeing
them
Did
he
ever
talk
to
the
executives
at
Fannie
and
Freddie
about
these
reckless
loans
Did
he
ever
discuss
with
them
the
stronger
oversight
I
proposed
If
Senator
Obama
is
such
a
champion
of
financial
regulation
why
didn't
he
support
these
regulations
that
could
have
prevented
this

in
the
first
place

Description
here
Who
said
this
wasn't
a
cult
This
stuff
is
getting
really
creepy
Voters
coast-to-coast
are
receiving
e-mails
from
the
Obama
campaign
encouraging
them
to
sign
up
to
learn
pre-election
agitation
tactics
at
Camp
Obama
Red
kerchiefs
anyone
When
readers
first
alerted
us
to
the
camps
we
thought
it
might
be
another
hoax
that
migrated
into
inboxes
But
it's
for
real
The
unsolicited
pitch
goes
like
this
Camp
Obama
attendees
will
receive
real
world
organizing
experience
that
will
have
a
direct
impact
on
this
election
Graduates

Camp
Obama
will
go
on
to
become
Deputy
Field
Organizers
who
will
lead
this
campaign
to
victory
in
crucial
battleground
states
around
the
country
The
letter
continues
By
participating
in
Camp
Obama
you'll
get
the
kind
of
experience
that
Barack
got
as
a
community
organizer
on
the
South
Side
of
Chicago
where
he
learned
that
real
change
happens
from
the
bottom
up
While
the
letter
neglects
to
identify
the
source
of
that
experience
a
slide
on
a
camp
blog
linked
to
the
Obama
Web
site
offers
a
clue
Underneath
a
Welcome
to
Camp
Obama
banner
a
trainer
at
Obama
headquarters
in
Chicago
is
seen
speaking
next
to
a
wipe
board
with
the
words
Saul
Alinsky
scrawled
across
it
Alinsky
is
the
late
Chicago
socialist
and
street
agitator
who
is
considered
the
father
of
community
organizing
Another
slide
of
a
camp
trainer
identified
as
Mike
Kruglik
is
equally
telling
Kruglik
happens
to
be
the
Alinsky
disciple
who
first
taught
Obama
hardball
organizing
tactics
on
the
South
Side
He
was
Obama's
boss
in
the
80s
Kruglik
now
works
for
the
Chicago-based
Gamaliel

which
trains

Oops
I

here

CONFLICT
OF

Unqualified

were

the
only
ones
who
benefitted
from
Massachusetts
Rep
Barney
Frank's
efforts
to
deregulate
Fannie

throughout
the
1990s
So
did
Frank's
partner
a
Fannie
Mae
executive
at
the
forefront
of
the
agency's
push
to
relax
lending
restrictions
Now
that
Fannie

is
at
the
epicenter
of
a
financial
meltdown
that
threatens
the
U.S
economy
some
are
raising
new
questions
about
Frank's
relationship
with
Herb
Moses
who
was
Fannie's
assistant
director
for
product
initiatives
Moses
worked
at
the
government-sponsored
enterprise
from
1991
to
1998
while
Frank
was
on
the
House
Banking
Committee
which
had
jurisdiction
over
Fannie
Both
Frank
and
Moses
assured
the
Wall
Street
Journal
in
1992
that
they
took
pains
to
avoid
any
conflicts
of
interest
Critics
however
remain
skeptical
It's
absolutely
a
conflict

STOP
Selling
Out
the
American
People
for
Political
Corrtectness
UPDATE
Rewritten
for
readability
and
to
correct
a
few
errors
Dear
Senator
McCain
Please
allow
me
to
clarify
in
the
headline
above
I
am
not
referencing
your
obtuse
refusal
to
let
facts
get
in
the
way
of
your
lame
defense
of
the
mythology/religion
disguised
as
the
truth
about
man-made
Global
Warming
no
what
I
am
referring
to
is
your
apparent
indifference
to
allowing
Marxists
disguised
as
Democrats
to
define
the
entire
debate
about
what
caused
this
financial
crisis
You
are
allowing
them
to
perpetuate
and
circulate
widely
an
out-and-out
lie--a
lie
so
grand
and
diabolical
that
it
ignores
historical
fact
i.e
that
unhindered
Capitalism
is
the
greatest
engine
for
creation
of
wealth
full
employment
and
for
raising
the
standard
of
living
for
everyone
that
the
world
has
ever
known
History
has
demonstrated
over
and
over
again
that
Socialism--or
any
large-scale
interference
by
government
in
the
operation
of
free
markets--is
among
the
most
destructive
non-military
forces
in
human
history
Senator
as
you
well
know
we
now
are
finally
seeing
the
end
result
of
years
of
Democrats
such
as
Barney
Frank
and
Christopher
Dodd
and
Chuck
Schumer
running
interference
for
their
surrogates
Fannie
Freddie
and
ACORN
all
of
which
in
turn
kicked
back
out
millions
in
campaign
contributions
to
the
same
gallery
of
rogues...)--which
has
engineered
this
financial
crisis
as
if
it
were
planned
by
some
diabolical
mind
What
is
most
disturbing
about
this
John
is
that
you
have
stood
on
the
Senate
floor
two
years
ago
and
warned
us
of
this
but
even
then
you
would
not
name
names
But
today
today
to
not
name
names
when
our
country
is
at
the
precipice
of
a
true
catastrophe
that
is
unconscionable
The
truth--just
waiting
for
someone
to
speak
it--is
that
the
Democrats
have
been
the
primary
driving
force
behind
the
Federal
Government
literally
forcing
banks
see
the
Community
Reinvestment
Act
to
lend
billions
to
disadvantaged
minorities
who
had
no
business
whatsoever
getting
those
loans
This
was
done
in
the
name
of
providing
opportunity
to
those
who
had
not
been
able
to
own
a
home
in
the
past
Tens
of
thousands
of
loans
were
doled
out
loans
which
no
bank
nor
financial
entity
would
ever
have
approved
had
not
the
Federal
Government
forced
them
to
For
this
we
have
to
thank
President
Carter
President
Clinton
George
Soros
Janet
Reno
Barney
Frank
Chris
Dodd
Chuck
Schumer
And
a
cast
of
other
rogues
who
in
the
name
of
populism
and
fairness
have
sold
their
country
down
the
river
Ultimately
their
treachery
was
not
helping
the
poor
realize
the
American
dream
as
they
claimed
it
would
do
rather
it
was
helping
people
without
the
means
to
do
so
to
ROB
banksof
capital
and
wealth
that
could
otherwise
have
been
utilized
more
effectively
to
help
our
economy
grow
In
the
name
of
fairness
the
Leftists
have
enabled
the
disadvantaged
to
drain
all
of
the
oil
from
the
very
engine
that
has
kept
America
employed
and
prosperous
Is
it
any
wonder
that
as
a
result
today
that
engine
is
locking
up
Yet--even
as
these
cretins
point
their
bony
fingers
of
blame
at
greedy
bankers
and
market
capitalism"--you
Senator
McCain
persit
in
your
refusal
to
direct
the
light
of
truth
to
the
direction
of
the
real
cause
of
this
crisis
Why
Is
it
because
you
are
afraid
of
some
ACORN
activist
calling
you
a
racist
Good
grief
man
you
have
endured
worse
in
your
life
You
can't
handle
some
community
activists
read
solicitors
of
voter
fraud
using
the
same
race-baiting
tactics
they
have
been
using
since
the
days
of
Malcolm
X
If
not
then
why
should
any
person
who
actually
gets
what
is
really
going
on
actually
believe
that
you
can
handle
the
Presidency
We
may
know
that
Obama
would
be
a
catastrophe
but
how
are
you
going
to
convince
independents
from
middle
America
that
you
can
solve
their
problems
if
you
can't
even
identify
their
problem
These
loans
were
not
wrong
because
they
went
mostly
to
people
of
different
skin
color
these
loans
were
criminal--because
no
banker
in
his
right
mind
would
have
made
most
of
these
loans
because
the
people
they
were
lending
to
were
more
than
likely
not
going
to
pay
the
loans
back
Period
Why
should
any
bank--a
business
like
any
other--make
a
loan
under
such
circumstances
A
because
they
HAD
to
Sorry
folks
but
that
is
not
free
market
capitalism
no
matter
what
Nancy
Pelosi
says
That
is
not
the
absence
of
regulation
it
is
the
consequences
of
too
much
regulation
And
after
about
20
years
of
this
government
intervention
the
note
has
finally
come
due--and
as
a
result
the
banks
are
failing
like
dominoes
So
the
very
same
corrupt-to-the-core
politicians
that
caused
the
latest
crisis
have
asked
us--several
times
now--to
bail
them
out
And
we
did
It
is
Frank
Dodd
Schumer
et
al
who
should
be
posting
bail
right
now
Yet
Senator
you
apparently
are
too
damn
scared
of
the
almighty
media
your
best
friends
right
John
to
dare
to
speak
the
truth
about
this
crime
of
the
century
Man
Up
for
God's
sake
This
is
not
a
game
this
is
our
future
our
retirement
and
our
childrens
future
You
ought
to
know
all
of
this
after
all
was
it
not
you
that
warned
us
all
about
this
on
the
Senate
floor
two
years
ago--even
as
these
same
Democrats
filibustered
repeated
Republican
attempts
to
establish
more
oversight
and
accountability
over
Freddie
and
Frannie
Was
it
not
the
Republicans
and
President
Bush
who
raised
the
alarm
about
the
danger
of
Fannie
and
Freddie
taking
on
all
this
bad
debt
with
very
little
oversight--even
as
Frank
Dodd
and
Schumer
paraded
to
microphones
and
to
the
pages
of
the
New
York
Times
to
state
repeatedly
there
is
no
problem
with
Fannie
and
Freddie
if
we
tighten
the
requirements
all
these
unable
to
repay
the
loan
people
won't
be
able
to
realize
the
American
dream
Today
these
same
corrupt
politicians
have
the
utter
audacity
to
blame
the
BANKS
and
WALL
ST
and
FREE
MARKETS
for
their
own
manipulation
of
those
markets
These
are
the
same
pols
who
forced
the
bankers
to
IGNORE
common-sense
lending
and
accounting
principles
The
problem
is
not
now
and
never
has
been
the
free
market
the
problem
is
that
the
Democrats
have
been
preventing
the
free
markets
from
doing
what
markets
are
supposed
to
do
And
yet
you
Senator
are
chiming
in
with
the
very
people
who
caused
this
problem
in
assigning
blame
to
the
market
economy
How
could
you
It
is
hard
not
to
view
this
as
a
betrayal
of
the
highest
order
made
even
more
so
by
the
fact
that
you
saw
the
problem
coming
Yet
you
still
refuse
to
name
the
culprit
You
say
you
would
rather
lose
an
election
than
lose
a
war
would
you
also
rather
us
all
to
lose
the
American
way
of
life
because
you
are
so
timid
about
telling
the
truth
Your
camp
is
apparently
so
petrified
of
race-based
accusations
by
your
opponents
that
you
the
fighter
pilot
who
endured
unbearable
torture--today
stand
there
like
a
deer
in
the
headlights
afraid
to
tell
the
TRUTH
even
as
the
Dems
and
their
cheerleaders
in
the
media
LIE
to
the
American
people
about
it
Many
of
the
people
are
clueless
enough
that
they
are
buying
this
load
of
crap
And
yet
you
will
not
speak
the
truth
Unfortunately
Senator
those
headlights
happen
to
be
a
runaway
freight
train
that
is
about
to
wipe
us
ALL
out
I
know
it
is
difficult
John
because
you
aren't
even
President
yet
but
this
situation
requires
being
Presidential
Bush
is
so
neutered
that
he
won't
do
it
and
no
one
would
listen
to
him
if
he
tried
YOU
have
to
do
it
P.S
Virtually
none
of
the
people
in
the
demographic
who
have
benefited
from
all
these
abominable
loans
are
going
to
vote
for
you
anyway
so
why
are
you
so
afraid
of
offending
them
Or
is
it
that
you
still
are
operating
under
the
illusion
that
the
media
will
treat
you
fairly
if
you
don't
go
there
Right
Put
down
the
pipe
John
It's
screwing
up
your
reasoning
Here
is
the
thing
no
one
is
going
to
tell
the
people
for
you--and
especially
not
the
DNC
propaganda
machine
known
as
the
MSM
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
IT
Apparently
you
think
that
Americans
can't
handle
the
truth--when
the
reality
is
that
we
have
never
needed
the
truth
to
come
out
more
urgently
Yet
there
you
sit
When
the
going
gets
tough--when
a
tough
decision
HAS
to
be
made
you
seem
to
be
demonstrating
that
you
don't
have
the
courage
to
stand
up
for
what
is
right
and
true
It
is
really
beyond
belief
that
a
Republican--who
announces
in
a
debate
that
he
was
part
of
the
Reagan
Revolution"--is
afraid
to
defend
the
very
economic
principles
that
have
given
us
the
highest
standard
of
living
on
Earth
But
because
Obama
is
such
an
abomination
because
the
very
thought
of
a
Marxist
in
office
is
so
such
a
monstrous
idea
to
even
contemplate--here
I
am
typing
away
trying
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
you
actually
are
trying
to
lose
this
thing
on
purpose
and
to
flush
the
rest
of
us
down
the
toilet
with
you
Man
up
John
We
need
you
now
Cut
the
crap
and
tell
the
truth
Second
stop
being
such
a
wimp
there
is
no
question--you
must
attack
Obama
relentlessly--and
you
must
not
let
up
until
after
the
election
is
over
Obama
is
cutting
you
to
shreds
every
single
day
on
the
stump
and
in
the
media
yet
and
you
won't
even
go
after
his
past
associations
his
complete
dearth
of
experience
his
hard-left
ideology--you
won't
even
tell
the
truth
about
how
they
ruined
the
economy
The
mighty
Oz
is
a
corrupt
bankrupt
party
that
has
brought
bankruptcy
and
financial
ruin
to
every
State
in
the
Union
where
they
have
been
governing
for
a
long
time
see
Michigan
Pennsylvania
Ohio
New
Jersey
Q
If
this
is
The
Wizard
of
Oz
then
where
is
Judy
Garland
when
we
need
her
A
We
saw
her
debate
Joe
Biden
but
your
handlers
won't
let
her
tell
the

either
John
just
between
us--If
you
do
not
change
this
dynamic
you
are
going
to
lose
For
God's
sake
man
tell
the
people
the
truth
We
can
handle
the
truth
But
what
our
country
cannot
handle
for
much
longer
is
the
growing
number
of
liars
and
those
who
know
better--who
nevertheless
would
prefer
to
go
along
to
get
along
This
is
not
what
our
country
needs
right
now
So
Senator
I
beg
of
you
please
stop
this
madness
There
is
too
much
at
stake
James
Pethokoukis
agrees
Here
is
the
big
question
of
the
moment
that
many
GOPers
are
asking
Why
is
John
McCain
not
tearing
into
Barack
Obama
and
the
Dems
on
the
huge
role
of
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
and
the
Community
Reinvestment
Act
in
the
financial
crisis
on
Wall
Street
In
fact
the
biggest
criticism
by
conservatives
of
Sarah
Palin's
debate
performance
last
night
was
that
she
had
the
opportunity
to
talk
about
Fannie/Freddie
and
the
CRA
but
instead
criticized
the
role
of
predatory
lenders
Here
is
what
Team
McCain
is
telling
me
Expect
McCain
to
make
the
case
on
television
but
don't
look
for

Obama
in

next
debate
point
his
finger
and
say
something
like
this
courtesy
of
the
Ace
of
Spades
HQ
blog
I
stayed
away
from
making
these
partisan
attacks
even
though
you
lied
ridiculously
about
me
and
your
own
attempts
at
reform
I
held
back
because
partisan
attacks
even
truthful
ones
would
harm
our
country
and
reduce
the
chances
of
getting
a
vital
bill
passed
Well
the
bill
is
now
passed
I
put
country
first
You
didn't
and
you
lied
on
top
of
that
And
now
only
now
that
this
crisis
has
been
dealt
with
to
the
extent
we
can
I'm
going
to
give
you
a
bit
of
straight-talk
about
Fannie
Freddie
my
attempts
to
reform
it
and
your
attempts
to
block
reform
on
behalf
of
your
big
donors
and
friends
in
ACORN
Nope
that
is
not
going
to
happen
Why
not
1
It
is
a
complicated
argument
and
McCain
is
not
good
at
making
complicated
arguments
not
even
about
earmarks
Note
additionally
his
lack
of
defense
of
the
war
in
Iraq
during
his
debate
with
Obama
Amazing

There
is
a
racial
component
to
criticism
of
the
Community
Reinvestment
Act
that
can
make
it
sound
like
you
are
scapegoating
minorities
for
Wall
Street's
problems

The
campaign
believes
McCain's
time
is
better
spent
talking
about
taxes
and
energy
and
healthcare
Really
There
is
a
newish
TV
ad
about
Fannie
and
Freddie
You
tell
me
if
it
makes
the
point
conservatives
desperately
want
McCain
to
make
I
don't
think
it
explicitly
or
aggressively
connects
the
dots
the
way
activists
crave
Here
is
the
transcript
ANNCR
John
McCain
fought
to
rein
in
Fannie
and
Freddie
The
Post
says
McCain
pushed
for
stronger
regulation"..."while
Mr
Obama
was
notably
silent
But
Democrats
blocked
the
reforms
Loans
soared
Then
the
bubble
burst
And
taxpayers
are
on
the
hook
for
billions
Bill
Clinton
knows
who
is
responsible
PRESIDENT
BILL
CLINTON
I
think
the
responsibility
that
the
Democrats
have
may
rest
more
in
resisting
any
efforts
by
Republicans
in
the
Congress
or
by
me
when
I
was
President
to
put
some
standards
and
tighten
up
a
little
on
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
ANNCR
You're
right
Mr
President
It
didn't
have
to
happen
JOHN
McCAIN
I'm
John
McCain
and
I
approve
this
message
My
bottom
line
The
McCain
campaign
is
underestimating
how
absolutely
furious
conservatives
are
that
free
markets
and
by
extension
Reaganomics
and
the
last
25
years
of
American
economic
policy
are
getting
the
blame
for
the
housing
and
credit
crisis
A
real
morale
killer

Down
Goes
Frazier
Biden
Down
Goes
Frazier
Biden
From
all
of
the
woe
is
Sarah
media
drivel
coming
out
this
week
you
would
have
thought
the
end
of
the
world
was
nigh
for
the
McCain
campaign
as
the
hour
for
the
Palin-Biden
debate
neared
As
it
was
prior
to
her
VP
acceptance
speech
so
it
was
as
the
media
piled-on
like
an
out-of-control
lynch
mob
prior
to
this
debate
she
was
out
of
her
league
not
ready
for
prime
time
etc
The
conventional
wisdom
was
that
Biden
was
supposed
to
chew
her
up
and
spit
her
out
and
clinch
the
game
for
Obama--who
in
reality
is
the
most
inexperienced
of
the
four
candidates
running
And
the
media
did
everything
in
its
power
to
make
that
happen
The
pressure
on
Sarah
was
enormous--with
all
that
has
happened
and
all
that
has
been
said
if
Palin
had
screwed
up
in
tonight's
debate
it
was
game
over
not
only
for
McCain
but
for
her
own
political
future
Ahhh...not
so
much
buddy
Governor
Palin
stood
on
that
stage
and
went
toe
to
toe
with
a
30-year
veteran
of
the
Senate
for
90
minutes
unbowed
and
unfazed
It
was
Biden
who
made
unforced
error
after
unforced
error
repeatedly
resorting
to
LYING
about
the
FACTS
to
counter
a
Palin
argument
at
least
14
lies
documented
here
Michelle's
take
was
spot
on
tonight
and
she
highlights
many
of
the
reasons
why
I
have
been
arguing
since
June
that
McCain
should
pick
her
First
I
would
like
to
see
all
the
Sarah
doubters
and
detractors
in
the
Beltway/Manhattan
corridor
eat
their
words
Eat
them
Sarah
Palin
is
the
real
deal
Five
weeks
on
the
campaign
trail
thrust
onto
the
national
stage
she
rocked
tonight's
debate
She
was
warm
fresh
funny
confident
energetic
personable
relentless
and
on
message
She
roasted
Obama's
flip-flops
on
the
surge
and
tea-with-dictators
declarations
dinged
Biden's
bash-Bush
rhetoric
challenged
the
blame-America
defeatism
of
the
Left
and
exuded
the
sunny
optimism
that
energized
the
base
in
the
first
place
McCain
has
not
done
many
things
right
But
Sarah
Palin
proved
tonight
that
the
VP
risk
he
took
was
worth
it
Her
performance
also
underscored
the
underhandedness
of
the
hatchet
job
editors
at
ABC
News
and
CBS
News
which
failed
to
capture
her
solid
competence
on
the
whole
array
of
foreign
and
domestic
policy
issues
on
the
debate
table
tonight
I
didn't
care
for
all
the
greed
rhetoric
but
I
understand
they
are
trying
to
appeal
to
independents
and
Dems
They're
trying
to
win
the
election
Pause
to
reflect
on
this
She
matched
and
trumped
several
times
a
man
who
has
spent
his
entire
adult
life
on
the
political
stage
run
for
president
twice
and
as
he
mentioned
several
times
chairs
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
Sarah
Palin
looked
presidential
Joe
Biden
looked
tired
Sarah
made
history
Biden
is
history
Prediction
Watch
for
a
whole
new
severe
strain
of
Palin
Derangement
Syndrome
to
begin
tonight
They
hated
her
before
tonight
They
are
going
to
pour
on
more
unfathomable
hate
at
a
level
we
have
never
seen
before
Sarah
we're
praying
for
you
Frank
Luntz's
focus
group
agrees
Sarah
rocks
Reader
Brett
had
a
sharp
observation
Palin
amazingly
avoided
falling
into
a
trap
when
Gwen
Ifill
asked
whether
she
agreed
with
Biden
on
a
particulalr
issue
instead
Palin
repeated
the
question
and
stated
her
answer
rather
than
say
I
agree
like
Obama
said
so
many
times
at
an
earlier
debate
Yes
that
was
excellent
Mark
Levin
I
have
been
involved
in
and
observed
politics
for
a
long
time
Governor
Palin
is
a
truly
unique
national
figure
She
is
down
to
earth
personable
and
smart
as
hell
That's
right
She
has
been
on
the
national
scene
for
a
little
over
a
month
she
has
been
campaigning
everywhere
she
has
had
to
bone
up
on
all
kinds
of
national
issues
and
she
has
shown
class
throughout
Too
often
too
many
are
persuaded
by
the
mainstream
media's
opinion
and
react
to
that
This
should
be
another
lesson
in
that
regard
As
for
some
of
her
populist
views
she
cannot
openly
campaign
against
the
positions
of
her
presidential
running
mate
She
is
the
bright
light
in
this
campaign
from
my
perspective
If
there
was
a
deer
in
the
headlights
on
that
stage
tonight
it
was
Biden
I
honestly
do
not
think
he
knew
what
hit
him
Meanwhile
Roger
Simon
points
out
that
the
biggest
losers
tonight
were
the
elites
of
Big
Media
Tonight
Sarah
Palin
drove
another
stake
in
the
heart
of
those
fuddy-duddy
reactionaries
that
constitute
our
mainstream
media
Going
toe-to-toe
with
a
senator
with
decades
of
experience
she
more
than
held
her
own
giving
lie
to
the
media
constructed
narrative
that
she
was
an
inexperienced
hick
from
nowheresville
Alaska
It
demonstrates
once
again
why
the
media
is
held
in
such
contempt
For
economic
and
ego
reasons
they
consider
themselves
to
be
our
gatekeepers
but
frankly
they
are
not
that
smart
They
are
not
rocket
scientists
figuratively
or
literally
They
are
certainly
no
smarter
than
Sarah
Palin
I
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
in
a
free
debate
with
Katie
Couric
Palin
would
come
out
the
victor
Frank
Luntz's
focus
group
saw
her
winning
literally
by
acclimation
over
Biden
I
actually
had
some
sympathy
for
Joe
Biden
tonight
who
we
all
know
thinks
John
McCain
is
better
than
Obama
anyway
he's
said
so
as
Palin
was
correct
to
point
out
He
was
an
aging
fellow
like
me
forced
to
debate
a
young
and
much
more
charismatic
woman
who
was
easily
his
equal
You
could
see
in
his
body
language
that
he
knew
it
But
if
McCain-Palin
actually
pull
this
one
out
it
is
the
MSM
that
will
be
the
big
losers
here
They
have
put
heart
and
soul
behind
Obama
without
really
knowing
him
For
shame
BTW
was
I
missing
something
or
did
that
aspiring
author
Gwen
Ifill
give
Biden
both
the
first
and
last
words
Is
that
legal
Since
when
has
the
media
played
fair

About
that
Failure
of
Free
Market
Capitalism
Just
in
time
for
the
Pork-laden
monstrosity
of
a
bailout
bill
Roger
Kimball
rips
to
shreds
the
so
called
failure
of
free
markets
A
home
run
One
thinks
back
to
the
words
of
the
Gipper
himself
now
as
then--as
always
Government
is
not
the
answer
to
the
problem
Government
IS
the
problem
It
is
part
of
the
genius
of
the
American
political
system
that
it
can
withstand
mediocrity
or
worse
in
high
places
As
Alexander
Hamilton
oops
Imeant
James
Madison
noted
in
Federalist
X
enlightened
statesmen
will
not
always
be
at
the
helm
and
any
democratic
system
worth
its
salt
must
provide
for
the
ascendency
of
obtuse
petty
grandstanding
partisan
hacks
The
110th
Congress
of
the
United
States
its
approval
rating
hovering
somewhere
south
of
10
percent
shows
that
Hamilton
that
is
Madiosn
see
above
did
not
plan
in
vain
Did
we
really
elect
these
people
to
represent
our
interests
What
were
we
thinking
Of
course
it
is
not
only
feckless
members
of
Congress
who
have
been
provoking
such
bemused
questions
The
steely-salt
taste
of
contagious
panic
has
elicited
all
manner
of
silliness
Probably
the
stupidest
trope
to
emerge
is
that
the
present
financial
panic
somehow
discredits
capitalism
at
least
American
capitalism
and
that
the
economic
fantasies
of
Karl
Marx
are
set
to
make
a
comeback
You
hear
the
former
from
such
exalted
personages
as
the
German
foreign
minister
and
Nicolas
Sarkozy
the
President
of
France
Capitalism
should
be
regulated
insists
President
Sarkozy
neglecting
the
detail
that
Capitalism
is
already
very
highly
regulated
It
needs
to
be
refounded
on
a
moral
basis
he
and
the
German
foreign
minister
say
forgetting
that
a
mechanism
for
the
production
of
wealth
is
a
mechanism
for
the
production
of
wealth
not
a
family
church
court
or
legislature
Step
back
for
a
moment
from
the
question
of
whether
the
trillion-dollar
bailout
is
a
good
idea
I
admit
to
having
grave
doubts
about
it
especially
when
we
saw
a
three-page
document
mushroom
into
a
451-page
pork
sandwich
honey
glazed
with
sweeteners
at
the
hands
of
the
Senate
yesterday
But
leave
that
to
one
side
Perhaps
this
expensive
effort
at
first
aid
or
is
it
life-saving
CPR
was
justified
though
if
it
is
time
if
it
is
a
little
breathing
space
for
companies
with
distressed
balances
sheets
that
was
needed
why
not
begin
be
relaxing
the
mark
to
market
accounting
rules
that
have
just
enacted
one
of
the
most
spectacular
financial
disappearing
tricks
in
the
the
history
of
money
An
asset
that
was
worth
a
1
billion
yesterday
is
not
worth
0
today
and
to
pretend
that
it
is
just
because
there
is
not
a
buyer
right
now
today
is
an
example
of
financial
pedantry
if
not
financial
terrorism
In
1982
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
stood
at
700
That's
seven
hundred
Over
the
next
25
years
the
engine
of
democratic
capitalism
went
into
overdrive
There
were
hiccups
and
recessionary
spells
in
1987
remember
the
market
lost
some
25
percent
of
its
value
in
one
day
but
from
1987
to
the
day
before
yesterday
we
saw
the
greatest
and
longest
period
of
sustained
economic
growth
in
history
The
current
pandemonium
on
the
Wall
Streets
of
the
world
is
not
due
to
a
failure
of
the
free
market
It
is
due
to
a
failure
to
observe
the
rules
of
the
free
market
In
The
Wealth
of
Nations
Adam
Smith
noted
the
paradox
or
seeming
paradox
of
capitalism
that
the
more
individuals
were
left
free
to
follow
their
own
ends
the
more
their
activities
were
led
by
an
invisible
hand
to
promote
ends
that
aided
the
common
good
Private
pursuits
conduced
to
public
goods
that
is
the
beneficent
alchemy
of
capitalism
Friedrich
Hayek's
fundamental
insight
enlarging
Smith's
thought
is
that
the
spontaneous
order
created
and
maintained
by
competitive
market
forces
leads
to
greater
prosperity
than
a
planned
economy
But
in
recent
years
the
invisible
hand
that
adjudicates
among
competing
interests
to
produce
the
most
efficient
channels
of
economic
growth
has
increasingly
been
replaced
by
the
heavy
hand
of
government-sponsored
social
engineering
One
especially
onerous
one
is
in
the
form
of
the
Community
Reinvestment
Act
which
in
its
fully-developed
post-1995
form
was
a
gigantic
wrench
tossed
into
the
engine
of
capitalism
that
stymied
the
orderly
evaluation
and
pricing
of
risk
It's
one
thing
to
give
Chris
Dodd
or
Barack
Obama
a
sweetheart
mortgage
for
favors
rendered
It's
quite
another
to
force
banks
to
issue
more
than
1
trillion
of
risky
mortgages
to
people
with
bad
or
no
credit
history
and
then
prop
them
up
with
taxpayer
guarantees
through
the
agency
of
entities
like
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddy
Mac
So
much
of
the
health
of
a
capitalist
economy
resides
in
a
seemingly
intangible
but
obviously
very
real
commodity
confidence
the
psychological
enabler
of
risk
The
financial
news
has
been
full
of
stories
about
the
flight
to
safety
on
the
part
of
individuals
and
institutions
The
irony
of
course
is
that
the
flight
is
only
a
time-buying
maneuver
The
safety
sought
is
ultimately
dependent
on
the
dynamism
of
the
whole
which
means
that
today's
safe
investment
is
tomorrow's
prelude
to
financial
uncertainty
if
not
indeed
financial
panic
Simple
prudence
may
have
dictated
the
initial
flight
to
safety
But
hoarding
is
both
an
unattractive
personal
quality
and
ultimately
an
imprudent
financial
strategy
There
is
a
lot
of
cash
sloshing
around
the
world's
economy
now
It's
time
to
put
it
back
to
work
Read
the
whole
thing
My
prediction
even
if
our
last
6
years
of
economic
growth
continues
unabated
if
a
Republican
Administration
is
at
the
helm
the
media
will
continue
to
spend
the
next
8
years
telling
the
public
how
horrible
things
are--as
they
have
for
the
last
8
years
And
if
they
do
that
guess
what
a
majority
of
people
out
there
will
continue
to
think
things
are
horrible
and
to
act
accordingly
in
their
investments
On
the
other
hand
if
Barack
Obama
and
the
Democrats
sweep
into
total
control
of
the
Government
the
media
will
try
for
the
next
4
years
to
tell
us
all
how
great
things
are
But
they
won't
be
able
to
hide
the
real
truth
of
what
Socialism
does
to
the
welfare
of
the
whole
no
matter
what
the
media
is
saying
Remember
the
70's
They
loved
Carter
They
hated
Reagan
And
Carter
got
slaughtered
Reagan
carried
44
states
and
won
489-49
There
is
a
reason
why
that
happened
and
that
reason
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
media's
cheerleading
for
Carter
Remember
that
when
you
are
in
that
box
in
November

It's
Official
Voter
Fraud
Legalized
in
Ohio
To
paraphrase
Gwen
Ifill
welcome
to
the
Age
of
Obama
Early
voting
is
taking
place
in
Ohio
Through
the
end
of
the
week
people
can
register
and
vote
on
the
same
day
The
Ohio
Secretary
of
State
Jennifer
Brunner
argues
that
they
are
merely
casting
their
ballot
rather
than
voting
so
the
fact
that
Ohio
statute
requires
30
days
between
registering
and
voting
would
not
interfere
So
here
is
what
is
happening
today
People
are
showing
up
to
register
and
vote
There
is
no
affirmative
evidence
that
these
people
have
not
registered
or
voted
somewhere
else
There
is
no
control
Normally
in
an
election
partisan
election
monitors
are
allowed
into
polling
places
so
that
they
can
police
each
other
But
not
in
two
counties
Franklin
and
Montgomery
in
Ohio
Brunner
also
issued
an
advisory
opinion
to
counties
saying
that
they
are
not
required
to
allow
election
monitors
Watch
an
election
observer
be
turned
away
Now
if
you
want
to
see
what
is
actually
happening
on
the
ground
This
video
shows
interviews
with
people
who
are
voting
in
Franklin
County
where
Republican
election
monitors
are
not
being
allowed
into
polling
places
My
favorite
is
the
quote
It's
a
perfect
opportunity
for
them
to
come
in
register
at
a
temporary
address
like
a
homeless
shelter
or
a
YMCA
or
something
like
that
They
can
register
at
that
address
because
they
don't
know
where
they're
going
to
be
tomorrow
or
next
week
The
registrar
also
doesn't
know
where
they
will
be
And
there
is
nothing
stopping
that
person
from
registering
at
a
different
location
tomorrow
or
later
today
Note
that
Brunner
cannot
be
said
to
be
simply
trying
to
protect
the
franchise
After
all
she
directed
county
officials
to
discard
absentee
ballot
applications
These
are
just
partisan
hacks
interested
in
winning
elections
If
that
means
stealing
votes
I
wonder
how
much
that
bothers
her?UPDATE
Speaking
of
Ifill
some
of
Gwen's
questions
for
the
VP
debate
were
leaked
to
the
press
today
it's
going
to
be
ugly

WHOA--PELOSI
GAVE
KEY
DEMS
A
PASS
ON
BAILOUT
VOTE
As
I
was
opining
earlier
Pelosi
did
not
want
this
to
succeed
I
heard
Gingrich
predict
tonight
that
Pelosi
will
load
up
the
revisited
bill
with
lots
of
earmarks
and
pork
to
buy
off
more
Democrat
votes
ACORN
Unions
etc
Yeah
that'll
fix
the
problem
However
Gingrich
did
have
a
suggestion
on
Fox
tonight
that
would
almost
instantly
free
up
the
markets
before
these
beasts
consider
another
bill
the
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
can
experiment
with
relaxing
the
spectacularly
stupid
Mark
to
Market
accounting
scheme
Gingrich
thinks
he
should
do
it
tomorrow
morning
because
it
would
work
and
because
Congress
could
not
do
a
damn
thing
about
it
Gingrich
issued
this
challenge
to
Paulson
and
Cox
just
try
it
for
two
weeks
If
it
works--if
it
frees
up
the
world's
credit
as
most
people
believe
it
will--then
keep
it
in
place
If
the
markets
continue
to
tank
then
you
can
always
reinstate
the
arcane
and
divorced
from
reality
rules
But
if
the
markets
do
heat
up
the
Republicans
are
in
a
much
stronger
position
to
demand
what
they
want
in
any
bailout
bill--and
the
Dems
would
really
be
walking
the
plank
to
do
something
stupid
without
them
Makes
sense
to
me

UPDATED--MANY
MORE
GOODIES
Human
Waste
II
Pelosi's
Poisonous
Stiletto
Kills
Bailout
Bill
On
Video
Putting
aside
the
fact
that
Barack
Obama
did
absolutely
nothing
to
move
today's
bailout
bill
forward
when
McCain
wanted
to
drop
everything
to
work
on
this
all
Barack
could
say
was
but
what
about
my
debate
putting
aside
that
Democrats
believe
an
economic
collapse
favors
them
in
the
upcoming
election
why
else
would
they
attach
riders
to
Paulson's
original
proposal
designating
huge
earmarks
for
hard
left
organizations
like
ACORN
and
putting
aside
that
last
night
the
leadership
of
both
parties
appeared
to
have
an
agreement--albeit
a
very
tenuous
agreement--which
had
a
good
chance
to
be
approved
today
what
happened
Why
at
the
very
last
moment
just
before
the
critical
vote
San
Fran
Nan
herself
stepped
right
onto
the
floor
of
the
US
House
and
then
proceeded
to
make
one
of
the
most
monumentally
partisan
and
stupid
speeches
of
her
life
It
is
a
speech
that
will
go
down
in
History
mark
my
words
As
many
Republicans
were
preparing
to
swallow
their
pride
and
take
one
for
the
team
just
as
they
were
preparing
to
suck
it
up
and
hold
their
noses
to
vote
to
create
the
largest
step
toward
State
Socialism
in
US
history--which
neither
they
nor
their
constituents
wanted--here
comes
ol
bug
eyes
herself
to
the
podium
with
a
burning
molotov
cocktail
to
hurl
onto
the
extremely
flammable
and
voliatile
floor
of
the
House
And
hurl
it
she
does
I'm
just
going
to
say
it
because
I
believe
it
to
be
true
Pelosi's
only
possible
motivation
was
to
achieve
the
very
result
that
was
achieved--to
torpedo
the
bill
not
to
mention
that
the
vote
lost
by
13
and
94
Democrats
voted
against
it
Perhaps
the
Dems
just
want
to
ram
through
their
own
earmark-filled
version
with
NO
Republican
votes
thinking
that
Bush
would
sign
it
Who
knows
But
I
do
not
think
the
timing
of
her
floor
speech
was
a
coincidence
In
the
past
several
years
there
have
been
so
many
outrages--so
many
examples
of
putting
naked
power
before
country
and
those
they
were
elected
to
serve
that
it
almost
becomes
difficult
to
chronicle
them
all
Some
of
these
were
so
insidious
that
I
to
this
day
consider
them
to
be
treasonous
and
seditious
To
say
this
is
this
worst-rated
Congress
in
the
history
of
ratings
does
not
begin
to
describe
how
utterly
dispicible
this
leadership
is
Still
at
this
moment
of
economic
crisis
not
only
for
America
but
for
the
entire
world--Nancy
decided
it
was
time
to
take
the
podium
BEFORE
the
vote
and
deliver
a
partisan
diatribe
emphasis
mine
The
House
quickly
divided
into
hostile
camps
on
what
had
intended
to
be
a
bipartisan
bill
with
both
sides
saying
the
other
had
not
held
up
its
end
of
the
bargain
Indeed
40
percent
of
Democrats
and
two-thirds
of
Republicans
opposed
the
legislation
in
the
205-228
vote
against
the
bill
Republicans
were
quick
to
blame
House
Speaker
Nancy
Pelosi
for
the
bill's
failure
saying
a
pre-vote
speech
in
which
she
criticized
the
Bush
administration's
handling
of
the
economy
had
turned
Republican
votes
against
the
bailout
This
is
not
a
partisan
crisis
this
is
an
economic
crisis
said
Deputy
Minority
Whip
Rep
Eric
Cantor
who
said
that
94
Democrats
also
refused
to
go
along
with
the
bill
He
described
the
vote
as
the
result
of
Speaker
Pelosi's
failure
to
listen
and
failure
to
lead
House
Republican
Conference
Chairman
Rep
Adam
Putnam
of
Florida
said
he
was
disappointed
that
the
process
that
yielded
a
bipartisan
approach
took
a
very
marked
partisan
tone
at
the
end
of
the
debate
But
House
Financial
Services
Committee
Chairman
Barney
Frank
D-Mass
took
umbrage
with
that
claim
Because
somebody
hurt
their
feelings
they
decide
to
punish
the
country
I
mean
that's
hardly
plausible
said
Frank
noting
that
the
number
of
Republicans
insulted
was
the
same
needed
to
pass
the
legislation
I'll
make
an
offer
Give
me
those
12
people's
names
and
I
will
go
talk
uncharacteristically
nicely
to
them
Sen
Lindsey
Graham
R-S.C
told
FOX
News
that
Democrats
knew
how
tenuous
the
bill
was
they
shouldn't
have
played
with
fire
Congressman
Frank
is
funny
and
clever
but
there's
nothing
clever
about
this
Why
would
you
poison
the
well
right
before
the
vote
is
about
to
take
place
he
asked
In
her
speech
Pelosi
asked
lawmakers
to
swallow
hard
and
support
the
legislation
But
she
also
piled
on
the
administration
When
was
the
last
time
someone
asked
you
for
700
billion
Pelosi
asked
in
a
floor
speech
shortly
before
the
vote
It
is
a
number
that
is
staggering
but
tells
us
only
the
costs
of
the
Bush
administration's
failed
economic
policies
policies
built
on
budgetary
recklessness
on
an
anything
goes
mentality
with
no
regulation
no
supervision
and
no
discipline
in
the
system
All
those
Republicans
who
were
about
to
cast
a
vote
that
went
against
approximately
65
of
their
constituents
calling
in
and
warning
them
to
vote
No
And
then
Nancy--the
Speaker
of
the
House
for
God's
sake--went
out
and
threw
out
that
bile
Hell
I
would
have
changed
my
vote
too
Make
no
mistake
this
was
not
a
coincidence
How
many
people
will
lose
their
jobs
savings
and
home
because
of
this
stiletto
to
the
throat
of
Republicans
just
as
the
vote
was
about
to
take
place
Here
is
the
whole
thing
on
tape
Keep
in
mind
this
was
RIGHT
BEFORE
THE
VOTE
IT
IS
AN
UTTER
DISGRACE
UPDATE
Via
Glenn
Reynolds
and
Eugene
Volokh
SO
THE
HOUSE
WON'T
RECONVENE
UNTIL
THURSDAY
That
seems
like
a
sure
loser
If
things
get
better
over
the
next
couple
of
days
it'll
make
it
harder
to
do
a
deal
and
make
them
look
irrelevant
if
things
get
worse
it
will
make
them
look
like
they
slacked
off
at
a
crucial
time
Plus
thoughts
on
Pelosi's
speech
Speaker
Pelosi's
speech
before
the
House
today
was
remarkable
but
not
in
a
good
way
She
was
trying
to
round
up
votes
for
a
bailout
package
that
shes
claims
to
believe
is
essential
for
the
stability
of
the
American
economy
She
can't
and
doesn't
want
to
pass
the
bill
without
a
substantial
number
of
Republican
votes
So
what
does
she
do
You
would
think
she
would
say
let's
pass
this
emergency
measure
now
in
the
best
interests
of
the
country
and
talk
about
who
is
to
blame
later
Instead
Pelosi
began
her
speech
with
a
highly
partisan
tirade
against
Bush
and
Republican
economic
policies
which
were
allegedly
to
blame
for
this
situation
She
focused
on
an
attack
on
the
growth
of
federal
deficits
which
clearly
are
at
best
tangential
to
the
current
crisis
That
to
me
is
the
sort
of
irresponsible
thing
you
do
when
a
you're
not
claiming
there
is
a
vast
emergency
and
b
you
are
in
the
minority
and
not
claiming
to
exercise
leadership
I
have
no
idea
why
any
particular
member
or
group
of
members
of
the
House
voted
for
or
against
the
bill
All
I'm
saying
is
that
if
you
are
trying
to
rally
the
House
to
pass
an
emergency
bill
you
make
it
seem
like
there
is
AN
ACTUAL
EMERGENCY
which
more
or
less
precludes
partisan
attacks
To
the
extent
any
Republican
voted
against
the
bill
because
of
Pelosi's
speech
it
may
not
be
a
question
of
them
being
offended
by
her
partisanship
but
the
perspective
that
if
Pelosi
thinks
that
the
situation
calls
for
partisanship
it
must
not
be
a
serious
emergency
because
leaders
simply
don't
engage
in
such
antics
when
a
true
emergency
is
at
hand
For
that
matter
if
I
were
a
Democrat
skeptical
of
the
bill
Pelosi's
speech
may
have
discouraged
me
from
voting
for
it
for
the
same
reason
Plus
a
more
cynical
take
on
Pelosi's
motivations

This
has

here
is
that

Why
It

the
bracelet
with
his
son's
name
on
it
Yet
Obama
continues
to
do
so
despite
the
wishes
of
the
family
If
that's
true
I'm
surprised
the
McCain
folks
haven't
made
something
of
it
UPDATE
More
from
Uber
Pig
at
Blackfive
For
those
of
you
who
watched
Friday
night's
debate
between
McCain
Obama
you'll
know
there
was
an
exchange
over
which
candidate's
position
had
more
authority
because
of
the
bracelet
he
wore
than
the
other
Background
from
Jake
Tapper
on
the
bracelet
issue
here
My
take
is
that
McCain
used
an
appeal
to
my
emotions
to
score
a
point
against
his
opponent
Barack
Obama
It's
a
well
known
effective
but
unfair
debating
tactic
An
appeal
to
emotion
can
be
used
to
justify
almost
anything
after
all
and
they
keep
people
from
getting
to
the
truth
from
arriving
at
objective
decisions
If
Obama
had
come
out
against
these
kinds
of
unfair
emotional
attacks
or
flat
out
got
angry
and
said
he
wouldn't
take
advantage
of
someone's
personal
tragedy
to
guilt
people
into
supporting
his
political
agenda
I'd
have
more
respect
for
him
But
he
didn't
and
I
don't
What
he
did
is
respond
in
kind
to
McCain's
gut
punch
with
this
sort
of
a
fey
pathetic
open
fisted
slap
that
fell
flat
because
he
didn't
actually
believe
the
lie
he
was
telling
if
you're
going
to
make
an
unfair
appeal
to
my
emotions
you
had
better
know
the
name
of
the
soldier
whose
memory
you
are
manipulationg
and
his
story
and
be
able
to
speak
of
that
story
with
authenticity.Authenticity

Obama

A
Debate
of
MANY
Missed
Opportunities
Who
won
the
debate
Well
like
many
subatomic
particle
physics
experiments
it
probably
depends
subjectively
on
who
was
observing
For
example
MOST
independent
Americans
and/or
Reagan
Democrats
believe
in
the
wisdom
of
the
American
worker
and
American
ingenuity
MOST
independents
believe
that
given
an
opportunity
to
compete
in
the
free
marketplace
and
to
explore
our
own
rich
resources
we
could
do
it
better
and
more
efficiently
than
anyone
else
provided
that
the
government
would
simply
get
out
of
the
way
all
of
the
angry
left's
twisted
contortions
to
the
contrary
MOST
Americans
do
not
want
another
9/11
to
occur--even
Democrats--and
a
large
majority
would
never
have
predicted
that
we
would
have
gone
this
long
since
that
horrific
day
without
being
attacked
again
There
are
of
course
reasons
why
we
have
not
been
attacked
again
along
with
a
little
luck)--reasons
that
McCain
obviously
did
not
want
to
bring
up
because
they
also
involve
his
predecessor
While
some
Independents
might
disagree
as
to
what
all
the
reasons
and
underlying
causes
were
in
truth
most
of
us
have
little
or
no
idea
what
actually
has
transpired
behind
the
scenes
since
2001
in
this
existential
war
against
our
virulent
jihadist
enemies
Most
of
us
have
no
idea
how
many
times
we
came
close
to
getting
hit
again
or
how
many
plots
have
been
foiled
because
of
our
playing
offense
But
when
it
comes
to
our
National
Security
is
our
feigned
ignorance
really
bliss
Or
should
someone
who
wants
to
be
our
President
actually
you
know
point
it
out
And
does
not
this
economic
crisis
also
threaten
our
National
Security
For
me
a
Presidential
debate
is
one
of
the
few
opportunities
that
candidates
have
to
communicate
over
the
media's
cheerleaders
those
24x7
purveyors
of
promoting
Democrat
candidates
and
spinning
untenable
policy
positions
in
order
to
decieve
as
much
of
the
electorate
as
possible
Debates
provide
some
of
the
few
opportunities
that
Republicans
especially
have
to
speak
and
connect
directly
with
the
voters
especially
those
independents
in
the
middle
who
will
decide
this
election
Reagan
was
masterful
in
this
regard
As
a
Republican
you
have
to
be
good
at
it
because
the
odds
are
always
stacked
against
you
by
the
media's
goo-goo
eyed
worship
of
these
leftist
idiots
And
let's
face
it
it
isn't
always
easy
to
convince
confused
and
conflicted
Americans
about
what
is
true
and
what
is
not
especially
where
economics
are
involved
For
a
politician
to
pull
it
off
they
must
have
a
good
grasp
of
facts
history
and
the
way
the
world
really
works
The
beauty
of
debates
is
that--regardless
of
the
undeniable
bias
the
media
throws
in
our
way
and
regardless
of
the
disservice
this
partisanship
does
to
a
functional
democracy's
ability
to
make
wise
decisions--here
is
one
a
golden
opportunity
to
for
candidates
to
communicate
ideas
well
enough
to
educate
the
uneducated--and
to
refute
the
talking
points
of
the
baying
hyenas
and
spinmasters
in
big
media
But--to
be
successful
you
have
to
actually
take
advantage
of
those
opportunities
And
therein
lies
the
rub
Yes
I
thought
McCain
did
better
in
the
debate
I
will
stipulate
that
However
I
was
sorely
disappointed
that
Maverick
allowed
Obama
to
play
rope-a-dope
for
so
long
Obama
is
a
master
of
twisting
a
question
into
a
speech
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
answering
what
was
asked
and
McCain
ought
to
be
dogged
enough
to
corner
Obama
in
this
weak
mealy-mouthedness
Facts
for
example
can
be
a
good
thing
when
they
are
delivered
in
a
timely
and
effective
manner
But
for
facts
to
be
effective
you
have
to
actually
speak
them
Friday
night
Obama
threw
out
some
real
whoppers
some
down
the
middle
fat
pitches
that
McCain
could
have
easily
hit
out
of
the
park
yet
he
did
not
even
swing
at
them
In
going
out
of
his
way
not
to
lose
his
famous
temper
and/or
to
appear
Presidential
McCain
failed
to
take
advantage
of
the
very
killer
instinct
which
served
him
so
well
in
the
primaries
often
to
my
own
chagrin
Perhaps
my
own
opinion
about
these
missed
opportunities
are
colored
by
my
having
spent
so
much
time
reading
books
like
Sowell's
spectacular
Basic
Economics
A
Common
Sense
Guide
to
the
Economy
also
available
btw
in
iTunes
or
at
Amazon
as
a
book
on
tape
Truly
if
there
was
just
one
book
that
I
had
to
pick
for
every
American
to
read
and
fully
comprehend
this
would
be
the
one
The
beauty
of
Sowell's
exposition
is
that
it
is
interesting
easy
to
understand
contains
numerous
real
world
examples
to
explain
each
concept
and
otherwise
is
virtually
inarguable
for
people
with
any
common
sense
intelligence
and
a
knowledge
of
history
I've
read
this
book
twice
now
and
also
have
listened
to
it
a
third
time
via
my
iPod
This
is
a
book
that
gets
better
every
time
So
yes
it
is
possible
that
I
do
not
consider
economics
to
be
rocket
science
because
I
had
in
Sowell
one
of
the
best
teachers
alive
Whereas
most
people
seemed
intimidated
and
turn
glassy-eyed
when
the
word
economics
is
even
mentioned
That
of
course
is
the
fault
of
our
educators--because
my
opinion)--they
don't
want
you
to
know
the
truth
when
it
comes
to
Capitalism
and
why
it
works
But
of
course
this
also
stems
from
the
fact
that
they
don't
understand
it
either--and
they
don't
want
to
Fine
then
maybe
in
normal
circumstances
you
would
not
make
a
huge
effort
in
a
debate
to
do
a
bit
of
plain
speaking
about
economic
principles
But
these
are
not
normal
circumstances
and
it
is
too
late
to
change
the
reality
of
where
all
of
this
built-in
big
Government
socialism
see
Freddie
and
Frannie
has
brought
us
the
World
is
in
an
economic
crisis
And
our
next
President
has
to
deal
with
that
So
frankly
I
don't
care
if
the
people
don't
understand
or
like
the
topic--we
have
to
try
and
make
them
understand
not
to
run
away
from
the
question
McCain
had
several
opportunities
to
explain
how
we
got
here...but
he
didn't
McCain
had
a
number
of
opportunities
to
prove
that
it
was
Government
Intervention
and
corrupt
intervention
at
that
enabled
by
repeated
Democrat
pandering
to
interest
groups
championing
untenable
business
principles--all
in
the
name
of
providing
greater
opportunity"--THAT
is
the
reason
many
banks
are
collapsing
like
dominoes
as
we
speak
Don't
we
deserve
to
know
that
McCain
missed
THE
perfect
opportunity
to
explain
which
Party
was
instrumental
in
precipitating
the
crisis
but
he
couldn't
bring
himself
to
do
it
That
would
be
too
partisan
I
guess
Yeah
well
so
is
Stalinism
Maybe
McCain
hasn't
read
enough
Thomas
Sowell--it
is
hard
to
know
But
if
that
is
the
case
then
maybe
he
should
read
some
email
me
John
seriously
I'll
buy
you
a
copy
Unfortunately
McCain
did
not
consider
it
to
be
worth
the
risk
of
overcoming
an
innate
American
economic
illiteracy
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
several
clear
openings
that
Obama
presented
to
him
the
other
night
You
see
when
you
are
debating
a
Marxist
on
economic
policy
it
should
not
be
that
difficult
to
score
powerful
points
nor
to
demolish
strawmen
like
the
ones
that
were
coming
out
of
Obama's
mouth
There
were
a
number
of
occasions
in
that
debate
where
I
felt
like
John
McCain
could
have
dramatically
slammed
the
door
on
the
Democrats
fear-laden
mythology
about
the
free
markets
Alas
he
didn't
take
advantage
of
those
openings
McCain
apparently
still
does
not
understand
that
when
there
is
no
media
to
translate
whatever
Populist
tripe
his
pollsters
tell
him
that
the
Public
actually
believes
a
debate
provides
the
perfect
opportunity
to
walk
away
from
all
that
cheap
dishonest
transparent
crap
which
both
candidates
have
been
regurgitating
ad
nauseum)--and
to
expose
the
unwashed
electorate
to
the
blessing
of
actual
truth
Don't
you
get
it
Senator
Once
people
can
see
the
truth
they
will
thank
you
not
blame
you
You
have
survived
a
living
hell
as
a
young
man
why
then
is
it
so
difficult
to
level
with
the
American
people
about
the
Genesis
of
this
financial
crisis
Senator
you
have
been
a
politician
for
most
of
your
life
yet
you
seem
not
to
grasp
a
basic
truth
ALL
politics
is
partisan
And
when
your
opponent
is
championing
an
economic
ideology
that
has
now
come
close
to
DESTROYING
this
great
country
it
IS
acceptable
to
point
that
out
Yes
sometimes
we
have
to
come
together
and
we
do
when
we
have
to
see
this
weekend
for
example
But
99
of
the
time
politics
is
bloodsport
It
is
a
zero
sum
game
That
sucks
from
an
intellectual
point
of
view
but
it
has
always
been
that
way
And
it
still
is
preferable
to
not
having
a
choice
in
the
matter
Therefore
is
IS
OK
to
stand
for
something
and
to
defend
it--especially
when
you
are
in
the
right
Friday
night
John
McCain
might
have
taken
great
leaps
in
actually
explaining
to
the
American
people
just
what
the
hell
has
been
going
on
since
the
days
of
Carter
all
in
the
name
of
fairness
he
could
have
clearly
laid
out
to
the
unaware
the
great
lengths
to
which
our
Government
led
by
Democrats
has
gone
to
overtly
and
covertly
sneak
provisions
into
law
which
have
since
then
forced
at
gunpoint
the
very
banks
now
going
broke
to
provide
opportunities
to
individuals
and
businesses
who
they
otherwise
would
never
have
given
loans
to
that
is
had
sound
business
judgment
and
not
social
engineering
become
the
PC
standard
for
issuing
credit
But
apparently
McCain
and/or
the
paranoids
handling
he
and
Sarah
Palin's
campaign
why
are
they
hiding
her
don't
think
it
is
worth
the
risk
of
being
honest
with
the
American
people
about
the
CAUSE
OF
THIS
CRISIS
It
was
not
8
years
of
Bush
John
It
was
31
years
of
Liberalism
run
amok
in
our
Government
Perhaps
he
doesn't
think
we
can
handle
the
truth
But
the
reality
is
that
as
a
free
people
we
will
not
be
able
to
endure
much
longer
living
under
the
continued
perpetuation
of
the
BIG
LIE
So
who
is
going
to
address
that
Are
we
so
afraid
of
ticking
off
ACORN
and
other
purveyors
of
bankrupt
social
equality
that
we
dare
not
speak
the
truth
about
the
root
cause
of
this
crisis
Thus
we
step
ever
closer
to
the
precipice
of
Paradise
Lost
not
because
McCain
did
not
have
plenty
of
opportunities
to
reveal
the
truth
about
the
Democrats
and
their
empty
ideology--but
more
because
he
let
those
opportunities
pass
I'm
not
the
only
one
who
has
been
thinking
in
these
terms
John
Pitney
has
also
recognized
a
number
lost
McCain
opportunities
emphasis
mine
read
the
whole
thing
here
More
important
he
missed
chances
to
score
points
on
Obama
Here
are
a
few
Early
in
the
debate
Obama
asked
rhetorically
The
question
I
think
that
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
is
how
did
we
get
into
this
situation
in
the
first
place
Instead
of
talking
abstractly
about
greed
McCain
might
have
said
Senator
Obama
wants
to
know
how
the
trouble
started
He
might
ask
his
close
adviser
Jim
Johnson
who
headed
Fannie
Mae
and
got
an
exorbitant
pay
package
Obama
promised
that
we
would
deliver
a
tax
cut
to
95
percent
of
Americans
McCain
could
have
said
Senator
Obama
has
made
a
lot
of
promises
In
2005
he
promised
that
he
wouldn't
run
for
president
In
2007
he
promised
that
he
would
work
aggressively
to
ensure
public
financing
of
the
presidential
campaign
In
2008
he
promised
to
fire
any
staffer
who
attacked
Governor
Palin's
family
He
broke
all
those
promises
And
now
he
promises
to
cut
your
taxes
Right
Obama
claimed
that
he
stood
up
and
opposed
this
war
when
it
was
politically
risky
McCain
might
have
replied
In
2002
Senator
Obama
said
he
was
against
the
war
Two
years
later
he
said
There's
not
that
much
difference
between
my
position
and
George
Bush's
position
at
this
stage
Then
he
went
back
to
opposing
it
again
So
he
was
against
the
war
before
he
was
for
the
war
before
he
was
against
it
Senator
Obama
should
compare
notes
with
Senator
Kerry
Obama
listed
a
number
of
energy
options
including
clean-coal
technology
That
line
was
perhaps
McCain's
greatest
missed
opportunity
of
the
night
It
seems
that
the
real
debate
here
is
between
Senator
Obama
and
his
running
mate
McCain
might
have
said
A
few
days
ago
Senator
Biden
said
and
I
quote
We're
not
supporting
clean
coal
And
by
the
way
Senator
McCain
could
have
added
your
running
mate
claimed
that
he
was
the
first
person
to
support
solar
energy
26
years
ago
Actually
the
first
major
legislation
on
solar
energy
came
years
before
that
and
Senator
Biden
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
At
least
he
didn't
claim
that
he
was
the
inventor
of
solar
energy
That
was
God
There
are
more
debates
to
come
Perhaps
McCain
is
holding
some
one-liners
in
reserve.Perhaps
But
he
blew
several
opportunities
in
the
first
debate
how
many
more
openings
will
Obama
give
him
How
many
more
chances
will
there
be
to
explain
the
differences
between
what
Obama
is
calling
for
and
how
the
world
really
works
McCain
had
a
chance
Friday
night
to
put
Obama
down
for
at
least
an
8-count
Yes
Maverick
may
technically
have
won
the
debate
on
points
But
Obama
still
lives
to
fight
another
day
And
that
is
too
bad

Key
Concessions

Putting
aside
whether

not
this

deal
is
a
good
thing
long
term
there
are
valid
arguments
on
both
sides

frankly
I
don't
have
all
the

that
by
stepping

themselves--coincidentally

not
timed
with
McCain's
visit
to
Washington--the
House
Republicans
have
succeeded
in
a
heavily
contentious
partisan
atmosphere
to
change
the

by
revoving
highly-destructive

have
killed
the

completely

the
compromise
plan
Myth
Windfall
for
ACORN
Fact
The
Frank-Dodd
proposal
created
an
affordable
housing
slush
fund
and
directed
20
percent
of
net
benefits
from
the
program
to
be
directed
to
ACORN-type
organizations
The
proposed
compromise
does
not
include
any
affordable
housing
slush
fund
and
directs
all
net
benefits
back
to
the
Treasury
to
pay
down
the
national
debt
Myth
Tax
increase
on
financial
industry
Fact
The
proposed
compromise
imposes
NO
tax
on
the
financial
services
industry
The
proposed
compromise
simply
requires
a
proposal
from
the
Administration
to
recoup
any
losses
after
five
years
Fact
The
proposed
compromise
includes
tax
cuts
for
struggling
community
banks
Myth
Blank
check
for
700
billion
with
little
accountability
Fact
In
general
the
Treasury
Secretary
is
limited
to
purchasing
up
to
250
billion
outstanding
at
any
one
time
If
the
Treasury
needs
to
use
another
100
billion
the
President
must
certify
this
action
and
report
to
Congress
Further
spending
requires
Congressional
action
Myth
Treasury
plan
is
the
only
option
available
Fact
Treasury
is
given
multiple
options
to
deal
with
the
current
economic
crisis
including
insurance
public/private
auctions
loan
guarantees
and
direct
support
to
financial
institutions
Fact
Further
Treasury
is
MANDATED
to
create
an
insurance
program
Section
102
that
protects
the
taxpayers
and
requires
companies
that
wish
to
participate
in
this
program
to
have
some
skin
in
the
game
by
paying
risk-based
premiums
Myth
The
taxpayer
is
not
adequately
protected
Fact
The
proposed
compromise
includes
strong
taxpayer
protections
Treasury's
proposal
had
minimal
oversight
to
protect
taxpayer
dollars
The
proposed
compromise
enhanced
the
oversight
structure
by
creating
a
Financial
Stability
Oversight
Board
a
Special
Inspector
General
and
a
Congressional
Oversight
Panel
All
AIG-type
deals
require
mandatory
equity
interest
in
order
to
provide
taxpayers
with
potential
future
benefits
All
auctions
require
a
percentage
of
equity
interest
based
on
participation
in
the
program
Requires
the
Secretary
to
develop
regulations/guidelines
necessary
to
prohibit
or
in
specific
cases
manage
any
conflicts
of
interest
with
respect
to
contractors
advisors
and
asset
managers
Myth
The
taxpayer
does
not
benefit
from
Treasury
bailouts
Fact
The
proposed
compromise
Section
113
requires
mandatory
equity
interest
in
scenarios
like
AIG
The
proposed
compromise
also
allows
Treasury
to
take
an
equity
interest
in
the
program
generally
Myth
Treasury
will
never
use
the
insurance
option
Fact
Treasury
is
mandated
Section
102
to
establish
an
insurance
program
and
set
risk-based
premiums
This
will
protect
taxpayers
by
requiring
the
beneficiaries
of
the
insurance
program
to
pay
risk-based
premiums
Treasury
further
shall
collect
premiums
mandatory
equity
interest
in
scenarios
like
AIG
The
proposed
compromise
also
allows
Treasury
to
take
an
equity
interest
in
the

Human
Waste
There
is
very
little
I
can
add
to
this
Quinn
Hillyer
post
regarding
the
flat-out
lies
which
Nancy
Pelosi
upchucked
for
the
cameras
this
weekend
Ignoring
the
fact
that
House
Republicans
didn't
so
much
boycott
earlier
meetings
as
that
they
were
EXCLUDED
from
earlier
meetings
on
the
bailout
Nancy
Pelosi
had
the
gall
a
little
while
ago
to
go
before
cameras
and
say
that
they
boycotted
meetings
in
the
week
and
that
their
non-participation
made
them
yes
quote
unpatriotic
If
Boehner
had
said
that
about
Pelosi
every
establishment
media
outlet
in
the
country
would
be
having
conniption
fits
for
about
a
week
and
said
that
it
blew
up
the
negotiations
and
showed
that
Boehner
and
Republicans
are
McCarthyite
etc
But
I
bet
you
don't
hear
a
peep
out
of
them
against
Pelosi
So
let
me
be
the
first
to
say
it
Pelosi
is
a
rank
damagogue
a
despicable
human
being
a
person
who
wants
the
United
States
to
lose
in
Iraq
a
bad-faith
bargainer
and
the
worst
excuse
for
a
speaker
of
the
House
in
history.And
that
is
saying
a
lot

Drawing
the
Line
on
The
Deal
What
House
Republicans
MUST
Insist
Upon
Earmarks
for
ACORN
or
other
pet
Democrat
causes
do
not
have
to
be
a
part
of
this
monstrosity
The
Democrats
have
the
votes
to
pass
a
package
without
Republicans
but
they
need
Republican
votes
to
give
them
cover
in
case
the
bailout
is
a
colossal
failure
So
the
House
Republicans
DO
hold
the
cards
here
And
if
the
deal
does
NOT
get
done
and
the
market
crashes
next
week--it
is
going
to
be
very
very
hard
for
the
Pelosis
Reids
Franks
Dodds
or
Schumers
to
explain
why
that
had
to
happen
for
a
few
earmarks
for
pet
leftist
causes
So
what
could
mess
it
all
up
The
Democrats
in
Congress
could
mess
it
all
up
We've
already
seen
that
they
have
larded
up
the
legislation
with
mandates
to
spend
any
revenues
from
the
bailout
on
programs
like
foreclosure
relief
aid
to
cities
and
states
and
funding
for
so-called
community
activist
groups
like
ACORN
and
La
Raza
that
actually
don't
share
the
values
of
a
majority
of
Americans
But
spending
the
profits
from
the
bailout
on
anything
much
less
on
politically-odious
projects
undermines
the
logic
of
the
trade
All
of
the
cash
flows
from
the
bailout
must
go
to
coupon
payments
on
the
borrowed
700
billion
All
of
the
at-maturity
payouts
must
be
used
to
retire
the
borrowed
money
and
get
it
off
the
balance
sheet
of
the
United
States
Otherwise
Congressional
Democrats
like
Nancy
Pelosi
Harry
Reid
Barney
Frank
and
ACORN-attorney
Barack
Obama
will
have
converted
the
greatest
trade
in
history
into
the
greatest
expansion
of
national
debt
in
history
Congressional
Republicans
MUST
insist
on
the
removal
of
all
of
these
earmarks
as
their
price
for
signing
on
to
the
legislation
And
they
can
do
it
too
The
American
people
are
so
overwhelmingly
opposed
to
the
bailout
plan
that
Speaker
Pelosi
dares
not
pass
the
bill
without
Republican
support
In
fact
she
has
stated
that
her
price
is
at
least
75
Republican
votes
or
100
if
she
can
get
them
Democrats
know
that
financial
markets
continue
in
an
exceptionally
precarious
state
They
have
to
pass
this
legislation
as
soon
as
they
can
ideally
before
the
end
of
the
weekend
Every
senior
Wall
Streeter
I
talk
to
is
using
phrases
like
very
stretched
and
can't
hold
out
much
longer
The
Republicans
are
therefore
in
a
strong
position
to
ensure
that
this
bailout
retains
its
potential
to
be
the
greatest
trade
in
history
rather
than
one
of
the
greatest
expansions
of
national
debt
in
history
The
latter
would
be
the
outcome
if
the
Democrats
are
able
to
ensure
that
the
profits
from
the
trade
will
be
spent
rather
than
returned
to
investors
Republicans
must
insist
as
the
price
of
their
support
for
this
bill
that
all
of
the
provisions
which
direct
that
bailout
proceeds
will
be
spent
on
any
particular
program
should
be
stripped
out
ATTENTION
HOUSE
REPUBLICANS
Don't
let
them
get
away
with
it
and
for
you
folks
playing
at
home
let
your
Congress
know
that
you
won't
stand
for
it
either

ofTV

Like
a
true
Stalinist--if

like
what

are

shut

down
Imagine
how

handle
criticism
as

used
to
having
his
way
Interestingly
he
is
not
a
fan
of
people
pointing
out
when
he's
lying
about
things
like
civil
rights
especially
that
pesky
Second

That's

Obama
has
a
team
of
hired
goons
some
call
them
lawyers
to
threaten
legal
action
against
those
who
air

The

sent
cease

desist
letters
to
news
outlets
in
Pennsylvania
and
Ohio
denouncing
the

and
demanding
their
