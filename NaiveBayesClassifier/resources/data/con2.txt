Gates

This
Race
Was
Never
about
Race
Nope
this
is
about
the
assumption
of
power
by
the
trans-nationals
those
harmless
we
thought
old
hippies
who
were
about
to
age
out
of
the
system
Instead
of
leaving
quietly
they
are
using
their
Manchurian
umm
make
that
Indonesian
candidate
to
cash
in
on
all
those
years
of
hard
work
in
the
mines
of

and

I
was

The
emergence
of
conservative
elitists
At
least
two
of
the
top
conservative
commentators
George
Will
and
Peggy
Noonan
have
shown
that
they
are
more
concerned
with
the
appearances
of
proper
behavior
and
knowledge
of
the
insides
of
the
beltway
than
with
the
spirit
of
the
Constitution
Both
belittle
Sarah
Palin
and
for
that
matter
John
McCain
not
with
substantive
issues
but
rather
trivialization
of
side
issues
They
sound
to
me
just
like
the
liberal
elitists
that
have
done
so
much
to
defame
Sarah
Palin
and
skew
the
news
in
Obama's
favor
It
must
be
hard
to
be
considered
an
intellectual
leader
to
have
to
forget
that
the
US
is
built
from
common
people
that
Andrew
Jackson
despite
his
poor
performance
as
President
was
elected
by
the
people
that
Davy
Crocket
went
to
Congress
that
Abraham
Lincoln
was
at
one
time
an
illiterate
backwoodsman
that
leaders
are
not
always
right
that
new
leaders
more
often
arise
from
the
common
people
not
the
elite
that
the
US
was
founded
to
get
away
from
hereditary
elites
One
of
the
distiguishing
characteristics
of
elitists
is
they
are
more
comfortable
with
other
elitists
even
if
of
a
different
political
persuasion
than
they
are
with
people
they
supposedly
agree
with
and
influence
when
those
people
are
ordinary
Despite
my
mother's
best
efforts
to
take
it
out
of
me
I
have
always
had
a
blue-collar
streak
in
me
I
like
people
who
work
physically
for
a
living
and
have
done
so
myself
These
are
the
people
who
understand
what
it
takes
to
make
things
happen
who
know
that
to
get
what
one
wants
requires
waiting
setting
priorities
and
making
choices
They
are
also
the
people
who
realize
that
the
first
line
of
defense
is
the
individual
not
the
police
and
that
there
is
absolute
right
and
wrong
The
elitists
on
both
sides
of
the
political
divide
forget
it
is
the
non-elites
that
fight
for
our
freedom
build
our
cities
collect
the
garbage
and
make
life
generally
livable
for
everyone
Elitists
write
articles
on
how
degrading
sweat
shops
are
without
realizing
that
to
the
people
working
there
they
may
be
a
major
step
up
That
does
not
necessarily
justify
the
sweatshop
but
there
is
a
reason
they
exist
Basically
elitists
have
no
clue
on
survival
vs
easy
living
or
that
ordinary
people
do
not
feel
sorry
for
themselves
but
simply
continue
to
work
to
improve
their
lives
and
their
children's
lives
Regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
election
John
McCain's
choice
of
Sarah
Palin
has
ripped
the
masks
off
a
lot
of
people
and
shown
just
how
trivial
they
really
are
on
both
sides
of
the
political
spectrum

Joel
Rosenberg
and
the
Nature
of
Evil
I
have
just
finished
the
five
book
series
by
Joel
Rosenberg
The
Last
Jihad
The
Last
Days
The
Ezekiel
Option
The
Copper
Scroll
and
Dead
Heat
The
stories
are
well-written
very
engrossing
and
very
scary
in
their
predictions
Overall
they
are
a
cross
between
Vince
Flynn
and
Tim
LaShay
an
international
hero
living
in
events
that
are
leading
up
to
the
Rapture
which
is
where
the
last
book
ends
In
combining
current
political
events
with
Biblical
prophesy
Joel
Rosenberg
runs
a
risk
of
being
overrun
by
events
and
even
being
completely
wrong
in
the
final
comparisons
However
part
of
his
popularity
and
credibility
comes
from
his
anticipation
of
many
of
the
current
events
of
the
last
few
years
not
so
much
in
absolute
detail
but
in
general
outline
I
think
this
comes
from
two
sources
the
first
is
a
very
good
understanding
of
international
politics
and
the
real
motivations
behind
various
governments
and
the
second
is
a
clear
understanding
of
what
constitutes
evil
Mr
Rosenberg
is
very
clear
in
his
statements
that
the
current
and
near
future
regimes
of
the
Middle
East
Eastern
Europe
and
Asia
are
evil
In
particular
he
names
North
Korea
Russia
Iran
and
a
rebuilt
Iraq
after
Saddam
Hussein
The
pragmatic
politicians
of
Europe
and
the
various
members
of
the
UN
come
in
for
their
share
of
condemnation
as
well
One
of
the
consequences
of
his
understanding
of
the
current
world
situation
is
that
the
US
eventually
becomes
a
non-entity
in
the
final
solution
Though
he
does
not
explicitly
say
so
it
is
the
result
of
years
of
pragmatism
refusal
to
stick
by
principle
and
the
desire
to
avoid
doing
anything
that
is
difficult
or
controversial
He
shows
that
our
unwillingness
to
recognize
evil
for
what
it
is
and
to
be
willing
to
accommodate
it
for
years
leads
to
our
eventual
destruction
as
a
world
power
The
primary
reason
is
our
lack
of
a
clearly
moral
compass
to
guide
our
actions
Rather
than
setting
our
own
rules
and
making
them
clear
to
the
world
as
we
once
did
we
try
to
play
by
the
rules
of
the
rest
of
the
world
as
we
perceive
them
not
understanding
that
their
purpose
is
our
defeat
The
central
hero
of
the
book
Jon
Bennett
is
as
conflicted
as
our
society
for
much
of
the
entire
saga
He
wants
peace
but
fails
to
understand
even
on
a
personal
survival
level
that
it
sometimes
requires
the
effective
use
of
force
In
fact
Jon
Bennett
eventually
dies
as
does
his
wife
and
unborn
child
slightly
before
at
the
end
though
he
is
saved
in
the
Christian
sense
of
salvation
In
many
ways
the
lesson
is
clear
either
fight
evil
at
all
times
wherever
it
appears
or
be
defeated
by
it
Despite
the
application
of
Biblical
prophesy
to
destroy
much
of
evil
in
the
third
book
of
the
series
evil
does
re-emerge
and
Christians
are
saved
by
the
Rapture
However
the
rest
of
the
world
is
left
to
deal
with
the
coming
horrors
My
theology
does
not
agree
with
that
of
the
author
I
do
not
believe
that
only
Christians
can
become
saved
to
go
to
Heaven
nor
do
I
believe
in
the
Rapture
and
the
other
doctrines
that
accompany
belief
in
it
However
the
fight
between
good
and
evil
that
is
presented
in
Scripture
both
Old
and
New
Testament
is
very
real
and
is
very
much
with
us
today
The
greatest
danger
we
face
today
is
trivializing
evil
and
its
adherents
Evil
is
not
some
wrong
idea
that
can
be
reasoned
with
or
explained
away
Evil
has
only
one
goal
the
total
destruction
of
everything
that
is
not
evil
and
due
to
its
nature
the
eventual
destruction
of
all
of
its
adherents
as
they
turn
on
one
another
after
destroying
everything
else
On
this
Joel
Rosenberg
was
very
clear
evil
will
never
stop
unless
it
is
stopped
by
being
destroyed
and
being
destroyed
completely
Just
as
weeds
re-emerge
from
a
fragment
of
root
left
when
uprooted
so
evil
will
resurge
after
being
defeated
unless
totally
defeated
Dealing
with
evil
presents
a
problem
for
basically
good
people
First
they
have
a
hard
if
not
impossible
time
believing
that
evil
even
exists
Second
even
if
they
do
realize
the
existence
of
evil
and
fight
it
they
are
reluctant
to
totally
defeat
it
They
want
to
give
it
a
second
chance
heal
its
wounds
and
believe
that
given
a
chance
it
will
change
They
do
not
understand
history
When
we
won
WW
II
we
did
help
our
enemies
after
their
defeat
but
NOT
THE
ORIGINATORS
Hitler
Mussolini
and
their
cronies
were
either
dead
or
were
tried
and
executed
The
Japanese
that
were
responsible
for
the
waging
of
the
war
committed
seppuku
or
were
killed
It
was
the
surviving
people
who
were
under
their
thrall
that
we
helped
and
changed
One
of
the
great
dangers
today
is
that
our
so-called
intellectual
elite
trivializes
evil
and
refuses
to
recognize
it
and
plays
on
the
decency
of
the
rest
of
us
to
hood-wink
us
into
believing
that
evil
is
just
another
belief
system
not
a
desire
to
destroy
us
Evil
is
easy
to
recognize
it
destroys
anything
that
is
not
itself
just
because
of
the
other's
existence
not
because
it
did
anything
A
homicide
bomber
that
kills
innocent
men
women
and
children
justifies
his/her
action
simply
because
they
exist
as
different
in
belief
or
behavior
The
source
of
such
a
justification
is
truly
evil
All
decent
creeds
start
with
the
premise
that
one
should
not
kill
Of
course
they
then
have
to
modify
the
absolute
to
make
it
compatible
with
survival
mainly
by
saying
except
in
self-defense
Evil
says
kill
anybody
that
is
not
in
agreement
with
it
Note
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
self-defense
but
with
the
existence
of
something
different
There
is
also
a
form
of
evil
that
actually
takes
pleasure
in
destruction
This
often
appears
in
the
desire
to
inflict
pain
and
suffering
in
the
process
of
destroying
others
This
can
take
the
form
of
physical
mental
or
emotional
torture
and
destruction
This
form
of
evil
is
more
often
recognized
than
any
other
form
There
is
also
an
evil
that
recognizes
no
end
but
its
own
It
does
not
seek
to
destroy
unless
its
ends
are
obstructed
It
is
indifferent
to
anything
else
but
itself
and
its
desires
This
form
of
evil
is
not
always
recognized
or
if
it
is
it
is
seen
as
arrogance
egotism
or
self-centeredness
rather
than
evil
However
anyone
who
gets
in
the
road
of
the
ends
of
such
a
person
learns
quickly
how
evil
it
is
It
is
a
damning
indictment
of
our
society
that
President
Bush
was
criticized
for
naming
the
Axis
of
Evil
It
shows
how
far
down
the
road
of
moral
failure
we
have
traveled
to
be
unable
to
recognize
or
to
admit
the
existence
of
evil

She
did
it
again
Sunday
October
19
two
days
before
her
54th
birthday
my
wife
completed
the
full
Nike
Women's
Marathon
in
San
Francisco--26.2
miles
in
6
hours
10
minutes
This
is
a
very
tough
course--all
hills
the
worst
is
mile
6-7
is
one
long
grade
going
from
0
to
300
feet
in
about
a
mile
That
is
approximately
a
6
grade
which
is
very
steep
There
are
no
flat
parts
on
the
course
Again
she
did
it
with
Team-in-Training
and
raised
3600
for
the
Leukemia
and
Lymphoma
Society
The
race
had
8000
TNT
members
running
in
it
and
they
raised
a
total
of
18
million
for
LLS
just
for
this
race
TNT
is
celebrating
their
20th
year
this
year
and
have
raised
over
900
million
for
LLS
in
that
time
I
am
very
proud
of
her
and
TNT
both
for
the
personal
accomplishment(s
and
for
what
they
are
doing
to
help
the
Leukemia
and
Lymphoma

This
is
a
travesty
of
what
citizenship
is
supposed
to
be
The
headline
in
this
article
says
States
hiring
thousands
of
new
bilingual
workers
in
advance
of
election
The
definition
and
requirements
of
citizenship
in
the
US
clearly
state
that
the
new
citizen
must
be
able
to
read
and
write
English
So
why
are
translators
needed
Either
people
will
vote
who
are
not
US
citizens
which
is
wrong
or
they
have
been
granted
US
citizenship
without
fulfilling
the
requirements
which
is
equally
wrong
To
quote
Pogo
We
have
met
the
enemy
and
they
are
us
As
our
freedom
and
belief
in
the
republican
form
of
government
we
created
disappears
lets
make
sure
we
give
proper
thanks
to
all
the
politicians
and
so-called
teachers
that
have
foisted
such
a
situation
off
on
us
They
will
get
what
they
want--a
low
even
playing
field
that
they
control
We
will
be
the
ones
paying
for
it--over
and
over
again

Yet
another
discussion
of
Determinism
and
Free
will
After
almost
a
year
the
second
part
of
this
series
is
now
posted
at
Bill's
Big
Stuff
Here
are
the
introductory
paragraphs
Part
2
Metaphysical
Reality
Introductory
Comments
In
working
with
reality
from
a
metaphysical
point
of
view
we
are
not
as
concerned
with
what
we
measure
as
in
what
we
conceive
as
a
result
of
these
measurements
We
deal
with
concepts
and
their
implications
as
such
We
are
trying
to
work
with
their
relationships
and
what
they
mean
In
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
absolutes
or
universals
which
science
can
corroborate
but
cannot
prove
or
disprove
Only
internal
contradictions
may
disprove
them
and
they
are
proven
only
to
the
degree
that
we
accept
the
truth
of
the
original
premises
upon
which
they
are
based
Because
of
this
we
have
to
first
of
all
decide
what
we
are
discussing
when
we
discuss
determinism
and
free
will
As
I
have
explored
in
my
first
attempt
at
this
discussion
determinism
can
be
approached
from
various
levels
and
to
varying
degrees
of
absoluteness
I
explored
physical
psychological
and
situational
determinism
However
when
the
issue
comes
up
in
such
discussions
as
this
one
the
issue
really
relates
to
choice
Could
I
have
done
otherwise
to
quote
from
Daniel
Dennett
Thus
we
see
the
entanglement
of
free
will
with
determinism
If
everything
is
determined
then
we
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
our
choices
but
if
it
is
not
determined
we
are
Metaphysics
impacts
morality
In
the
third
part
of
this
discussion
I
will
show
that
the
two
may
become
disentangled
I
will
show
that
whether
the
Universe
is
deterministic
or
not
has
no
bearing
on
Free
Will
For
this
part
of
the
discussion
however
I
want
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
universal
determinism
To
do
this
I
will
work
with
two
concepts
first
presented
in
Part
1
reversibility
and
continuity
By
developing
the
concepts
of
reversibility
and
continuity
we
will
be
able
to
put
some
constraints
on
the
problem
However
I
conclude
that
the
issue
is
actually
moot
that
we
cannot
determine
the
Determinism
of
the
Universe
Sorry
I
couldn't
resist
that
one

Reflections
on
the
sources
of
freedom
Two
trips
to
Europe
France
at
Easter
and
the
latest
one
to
the
United
Kingdom
have
provided
some
interesting
perspectives
on
cultures
and
governments
It
came
to
me
as
I
was
touring
a
castle
that
castles
are
the
emblems
of
England's
failure
not
her
success
Though
England
is
the
strongest
country
in
Europe
she
could
have
been
the
equal
of
the
US
in
the
world
and
at
one
time
was
the
supreme
power
in
the
world
were
it
not
for
the
nobility
and
what
it
did
to
divert
and
tie
up
resources
and
squelch
opportunity
There
have
been
members
of
the
nobility
that
have
put
their
riches
to
work
but
for
much
of
England's
history
their
wealth
has
been
spent
on
consumption
and
ostentation
In
one
sense
it
was
their
wealth
to
spend
but
they
did
not
obtain
it
by
earning
it
or
creating
wealth
They
inherited
it
and
much
of
it
was
obtained
by
taxation
and
rents
of
properties
where
they
had
a
monopoly
on
the
rental
property
And
the
heirs
to
the
estates
did
nothing
to
qualify
themselves
except
the
accident
of
being
the
first-born
son
But
England
was
an
almost
republican
form
of
government
a
form
that
reached
its
peak
in
the
US
and
the
culmination
of
several
paths
taking
the
best
from
several
civilizations
and
forming
a
great
empire
that
no
other
country
has
equaled
despite
their
best
efforts
It
also
had
the
World's
greatest
economy
until
the
US
came
along
after
the
War
between
the
States
Let's
go
back
and
look
at
some
milestone
civilizations
that
contributed
to
the
final
outcome
that
is
the
US
from
the
United
Kingdom
The
Sumerians
with
their
cuneiform
tablets
provided
the
first
durable
public
records
The
Egyptians
developed
surveying
to
re-ascertain
boundaries
after
the
annual
Nile
floods
This
is
essential
to
the
concept
of
property
as
the
property
must
be
defined
The
Greeks
provided
the
rules
of
discourse
and
many
examples
Their
form
of
governance
was
not
a
useful
model
being
based
on
slavery
as
a
proper
state
for
some
men
but
the
philosophers
provided
the
means
by
which
thinking
could
be
effectively
accomplished
It
was
the
Romans
who
made
some
of
the
greatest
practical
contributions
administration
a
coherent
body
of
civil
law
and
public
works
especially
roads
In
the
meantime
while
Europe
was
ruled
by
monarchs
who
were
essentially
absolute
England
was
being
ruled
by
the
Saxons
and
other
tribes
with
their
concepts
of
freemen
These
men
were
independent
and
could
make
their
own
way
without
having
to
swear
fealty
to
a
noble
There
were
various
degrees
of
freedom
all
the
way
from
a
free
person
as
we
conceive
of
it
to
a
true
slave
and
a
person
could
move
from
one
category
to
another
for
many
reasons
They
also
had
the
idea
that
a
leader
did
not
lead
by
might
alone
but
had
to
be
supported
by
his
subordinates
This
concept
would
later
be
formalized
in
the
Magna
Carta
This
document
was
important
because
it
gave
the
nobility
rights
under
the
monarch
not
rights
to
the
people
But
it
is
a
critical
step
in
that
the
rest
of
Europe
did
not
adopt
such
a
measure
and
so
continued
to
build
little
or
no
infrastructure
and
tradition
so
that
when
the
freedom
that
commerce
and
manufacturing
required
became
important
it
was
lacking
Additionally
England
created
trial
by
jury
which
I
consider
the
second
most
powerful
defense
of
freedom
the
first
being
the
Second
Amendment
Part
of
these
ideas
comes
also
from
my
experiences
in
France
with
the
French
bureaucracy
Petty
officials
are
petty
dictators
Where
a
clerk
in
England
or
the
US
will
do
their
best
to
be
helpful
a
French
clerk
will
tend
to
bully
and
stonewall
accepting
no
blame
This
is
no
more
than
a
model
based
on
their
traditions
of
dictatorship
Look
at
their
history
with
five
so-called
Republics
punctuated
by
kings
and
would-be
emperors
the
Louis
and
Napoleon
being
the
outstanding
examples
During
the
nineteenth
century
England
underwent
a
manufacturing
boom
just
as
the
US
did
It
lasted
well
beyond
WW
I
until
the
depression
and
WW
II
Both
the
horrible
pounding
during
WW
II
and
the
rise
of
socialism
as
an
organized
political
movement
provided
obstacles
to
the
continuation
of
the
boom
economy
after
the
war
This
was
briefly
abated
during
Margaret
Thatcher's
Prime
Ministership
but
continues
today
under
the
Labor
socialist
government
It
is
the
socialism
that
probably
counts
for
most
of
their
economic
and
social
trouble
and
I
think
the
rise
of
socialism
in
Great
Britain
is
directly
due
to
the
existence
of
the
nobility
and
their
notion
of
class
This
provided
the
resentment
that
socialism
feeds
on
The
US
started
as
a
mirror
of
Great
Britain
but
after
independence
we
made
on
significant
decision
we
did
not
institute
a
monarchy
of
any
kind
All
of
our
leaders
were
elected
There
were
no
hereditary
positions
with
their
incumbencies
having
no
relationship
to
competence
Under
law
everyone
had
the
same
opportunities
and
poor
people
became
rich
and
rich
people
became
poor
Inherited
wealth
was
squandered
and
disappeared
if
the
heirs
were
not
competent
at
managing
its
source
There
were
few
monopolies
the
Post
Office
being
one
notable
exception
so
if
a
service
was
not
satisfactory
or
too
expensive
other
choices
eventually
appeared
Thus
the
only
barrier
in
theory
was
the
degree
of
competence
and
amount
of
effort
one
was
willing
to
exert
During
the
late
Nineteenth
century
the
owners
of
manufacturing
and
mining
facilities
attempted
in
many
cases
to
create
their
own
fiefdoms
and
turn
their
employees
into
serfs
The
result
of
this
was
a
strong
union
movement
that
forced
them
out
of
that
model
Although
it
is
also
true
that
many
unions
were
run
as
dictatorships
over
time
that
also
became
less
and
unions
have
come
to
be
more
a
protection
racket
and
a
deterrent
to
their
members
best
long-term
interests
than
a
protection
from
management
The
strength
of
the
US
which
is
now
being
eroded
by
a
number
of
factors
is
that
we
are
as
nearly
a
homgenious
society
in
rights
and
privileges
as
can
be
imagined
Money
talks
but
anyone
has
the
potential
to
make
enough
money
to
be
the
loudmouth
so
it
all
works
fairly
well
and
because
of
the
relative
equal
opportunity
and
status
under
law
and
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
world
high
standard
of
living
there
is
commonness
of
purpose
and
common
values
At
this
point
there
are
a
number
of
riffs
one
could
make
on
this
but
the
one
that
seems
most
apropos
relates
to
the
attempts
to
undermine
this
model
There
have
always
been
people
who
think
they
know
the
answers
better
than
anyone
else
and
deserve
to
be
treated
better
because
they
are
smarter
prettier
richer
etc
They
desire
to
be
entitled
by
their
existence
and
not
their
accomplishments
Underneath
they
are
envious
and
wish
to
succeed
not
by
accomplishment
but
by
pulling
others
down
They
have
their
counterparts
in
other
countries
especially
Europe
and
they
have
more
feelings
of
kinship
to
one
another
than
to
their
mother
country
To
these
people
the
very
existence
of
the
US
is
a
slap
in
the
face
Its
success
runs
counter
to
every
idea
they
espouse
and
so
they
do
all
they
can
to
tear
it
down
emphasizing
how
it
appears
to
the
rest
of
the
world
and
revealing
their
own
insecurity
and
emphasis
on
appearance
not
substance
how
unfair
it
is
demanding
equality
of
outcome
not
equality
of
opportunity
and
trying
to
make
the
government
not
individual
effort
the
source
of
benefits
This
group
of
people
spends
their
effort
and
talent
to
be
in
control
and
be
the
source
of
ideas
on
running
things
preferably
by
law
and
dictate
not
by
expertise
And
so
they
go
into
politics
and
form
societies
that
try
to
be
considered
the
sole
source
of
ideas
on
social
and
political
ideas
They
do
this
in
all
Western
European
countries
Australia
and
New
Zealand
the
rest
of
the
world
does
not
fit
this
model
in
this
way
However
my
experiences
in
talking
to
ordinary
people
the
servers
hotel
staffs
and
especially
cab
drivers
reveals
that
the
real
producers
working
people
understand
what
makes
things
work
and
what
is
really
necessary
for
success
and
this
applies
to
people
from
other
countries
than
the
US
England
and
France
I
have
talked
to
Russian
immigrants
and
Iranian
immigrants
All
of
them
have
a
better
understanding
of
economic
realities
and
the
political
behavior
that
supports
it
than
the
so-called
leaders
The
problem
is
they
are
too
busy
working
raising
families
and
building
businesses
to
either
devote
a
lot
of
thought
to
what
is
going
on
around
them
or
to
do
something
about
it
It
also
does
not
help
that
our
education
system
and
England's
is
degenerating
a
deliberate
state
of
affairs
I
believe
Would
be
dictators
don't
want
thinking
people
as
subjects
so
that
the
ability
to
express
what
is
felt
as
a
dissatisfaction
is
diminished
as
is
the
power
to
analyze
issues
and
problems
or
sort
out
truth
from
fiction
and
opinion
in
news
As
a
consequence
major
policy
decisions
are
left
to
a
few
that
have
their
own
agendas
not
that
of
the
common
people
What
is
coming
is
a
peaceful
revolution
The
US
provides
much
better
mechanisms
for
political
change
than
do
other
countries
Because
the
entire
government
can
be
changed
over
time
it
will
be
We
are
seeing
it
happen
now
The
dissatisfaction
will
displace
most
of
the
Republicans
and
then
when
the
Democrats
mistakenly
act
as
if
they
were
given
a
mandate
they
in
turn
will
go
There
will
be
a
major
infusion
of
new
blood
and
ideas
into
our
politics
The
one
area
that
will
be
immune
to
immediate
political
change
will
be
the
courts
If
the
courts
were
staffed
with
judges
who
were
chosen
on
their
ability
to
interpret
law
all
would
be
well
But
the
appointment
and
ratification
of
judges
has
become
ideological
The
decisions
made
by
judges
and
the
opinions
issued
are
not
discussed
with
respect
to
their
quality
but
their
ideology
Hence
we
talk
about
the
Conservative
and
Liberal
factions
on
the
Supreme
Court
and
the
swing
vote
of
Justice
Kennedy
Conservatives
worry
that
a
Democratic
President
will
make
appointments
that
will
take
the
country
into
socialism
and
the
Democrats
worry
that
certain
rights
would
be
overturned
if
there
were
a
Republican
President
Again
it
is
the
elitists
we
are
talking
about
and
they
exist
on
both
sides
of
the
fence
Eric
Hoffer
had
an
excellent
name
for
them
True
Believers
We
can
only
hope
that
they
do
not
obtain
control
of
the
country
from
either
side

High-Level
History
Lesson
This
was
sent
to
me
by
a
friend
There
is
no
attribution
for
authorship
In
some
ways
it
over-generalizes
and
over-simplifies
but
I
think
the
general
conclusions
listed
are
true
having
lived
through
all
of
this
In
fact
is
various
posts
to
this
blog
I
have
said
much
the
same
things
myself
Though
various
pieces
may
be
attacked
for
details
the
overall
synthesis
is
not
all
that
far
off
Read
it
and
decide
for
yourself
WILL
HISTORY
REPEAT
ITSELF
With
the
two
primary
Presidential
candidates
clearly
identified
having
major
differences
in
their
experience
background
and
platform
it
is
important
to
look
back
to
see
if
history
is
destined
to
repeat
itself
THE
FROG
THEORY
If
you
drop
a
frog
into
boiling
water
he
will
leap
right
out
If
you
slowly
heat
the
water
he
will
be
content
until
it's
too
late
to
get
out
That
is
exactly
how
history
works
It
moves
slowly
and
we
never
really
see
any
danger
until
it's
too
late
Remember
how
workers
were
suppressed
before
unions
came
along
The
unions
leveled
the
playing
field
Unfortunately,over
a
long
period
of
time
the
pendulum
swung
too
far
Slowly
businesses
and
factories
closed
and
jobs
left
the
country
We
were
comfortable
and
didn't
see
the
change
coming
We
blamed
everyone
except
ourselves
for
what
happened
We
weren't
alert
to
how
slow
things
change
over
time
World
War
II
and
the
Korean
War
demonstrated
how
powerful
a
united
nation
could
be
Our
nation
and
our
families
were
united
The
father
was
the
head
of
the
family
and
the
President
was
the
head
of
the
nation
Both
were
highly
respected
We
were
content
and
happy
We
were
good
at
fighting
a
hot
war
but
we
were
unprepared
to
fight
a
cold
war
with
the
communists
in
the
50's
They
knew
they
couldn't
change
us
but
they
didn't
care
Their
philosophy
was
to
wait
it
out
and
capture
the
minds
of
our
children
They
loaded
our
colleges
with
many
of
their
professors
and
waited
It
didn't
take
long
to
see
the
results
The
60's
ushered
in
the
radicals
drug
culture
student
protesters
and
the
Vietnam
War
The
aim
of
the
cold
war
was
to
divide
and
conquer
They
divided
our
families
and
the
nation
The
secret
to
defeating
a
polite
and
respectful
people
is
to
scream
The
louder
and
longer
you
scream
the
better
your
chance
of
winning
Radicals
are
masters
at
this
form
of
attack
They
know
if
you
constantly
scream
and
repeat
a
lie
it
will
eventually
become
the
truth
The
media
and
Hollywood
hammered
us
with
Hate
America
themes
and
stories
They
took
God
out
of
our
schools
our
service
men
and
women
were
jeered
cursed
and
spit
on
Even
the
people
who
later
wanted
to
become
their
President
thrashed
them
We
lost
our
first
War
in
history
There
was
no
hero's
homecoming
for
our
fighting
men
and
women
The
Reverend
King
who
was
raised
in
the
old
school
peacefully
changed
the
race
issue
and
united
the
people
When
he
died
the
new
breed
of
leaders
like
the
Jesse
Jackson's
Lewis
Farakon's
Al
Sharpton's
and
Rev
Wright's
put
a
lid
on
King's
efforts
and
turned
racism
into
a
money
making
machine
Corporations
were
green-mailed
by
threats
of
protests
product
boycotts
or
endless
lawsuits
Every
issue
large
or
small
became
a
race
issue
The
public
recoiled
in
fear
of
being
called
a
racist
Their
voices
were
silenced
because
one
word
could
cost
you
a
career
get
you
fired
or
get
you
sued
Even
politicians
buckled
under
to
the
pressure
The
Florida
legislature
issued
a
formal
apology
for
having
slavery
200
years
ago
They
were
thanked
by
being
asked
for
compensation
There
is
no
end
in
sight
for
this
kind
of
nonsense
America
didn't
capture
slaves
and
bring
them
to
America
Their
own
people
sold
them
to
slave
traders
from
several
nations
This
knowledge
doesn't
stop
the
screamers
History
is
what
it
is
and
you
can't
change
it
There
have
been
many
tragic
events
in
history
You
acknowledge
them
and
move
on
They
divided
our
nation
into
two
separate
Americas
We
now
have
Americans
and
African-Americans
although
Africa
has
nothing
to
do
with
being
an
American
You
can
be
one
or
the
other
but
not
both
You
are
what
you
were
born
to
be
You
do
not
subordinate
our
country
to
any
foreign
nation
It's
equivalent
to
flying
the
African
flag
above
the
Stars
and
Stripes
If
you
hyphenate
two
countries
America
always
comes
first
This
election
year
could
be
the
turning
point
in
our
history
because
the
frog
theory
has
come
into
play
It's
time
to
step
back
and
look
at
how
the
country
has
slowly
changed
since
the
cold
war
started
Don't
get
caught
up
in
all
the
hype
George
McGovern
was
the
first
Presidential
candidate
to
test
the
waters
with
college
students
The
Clinton
s
played
a
big
role
in
his
campaign
It
was
the
worst
campaign
ever
run
He
was
crushed
in
the
election
Step
two
was
to
infiltrate
all
the
information
vehicles
such
as
radio
newspapers
magazines
TV
and
movies
They
were
quite
successful
at
that
Jimmy
Carter
was
the
first
President
to
demonstrate
the
leadership
skills
of
the
far
left
Weak
military
high
taxes
runaway
inflation
19
mortgage
rates
and
plain
incompetence
ended
his
career
in
Washington
Iran
a
small
country
at
the
time
took
American
hostages
and
kicked
sand
in
our
face
By
negotiating
from
weakness
Carter
could
not
get
the
hostages
released
The
big
benefit
of
the
Carter
years
is
that
they
were
followed
by
the
Reagan
years
The
nation
got
a
clear
look
at
the
difference
between
a
weak
nation
and
a
strong
nation
Every
student
should
know
this
difference
After
Ronald
Reagan
took
over
the
hostages
were
quickly
released
taxes
were
lowered
inflation
dropped
mortgage
rates
dropped
and
the
military
was
strengthened
Russia
quickly
waved
the
white
flag
and
waited
for
another
Democrat
term
Clinton
took
over
Carter's
uncompleted
social
programs
He
weakened
the
military
and
tried
to
pass
large
government
programs
An
Intern
derailed
his
Presidency
While
he
was
tied
up
with
his
personal
problems
his
lawyers
ran
the
country
He
passed
up
three
opportunities
to
take
out
Osama
Bin
Laden
This
eventually
cost
us
the
loss
of
our
Twin
Towers
thousands
of
American
lives
and
got
us
involved
in
a
war
with
Iraq
There
were
endless
stories
about
our
evil
nation
and
its
President
Top-secret
plans
were
leaked
to
the
press
and
printed
for
the
entire
world
to
see
Hollywood
cranked
out
documentaries
about
the
evil
Bush
administration
and
our
evil
military
They
laid
the
groundwork
for
the
next
election
The
ACLU
flooded
the
courts
with
lawsuits
and
the
Democrat
party
became
a
law
firm
Almost
every
incumbent
or
his
or
her
spouse
is
a
lawyer
They
now
have
the
perfect
candidate
because
they
can
squash
criticism
by
playing
the
race
card
If
you
don't
like
Obama
or
criticize
him
you
are
a
racist
They
can
hide
his
inexperience
and
background
by
turning
him
into
a
rock
star
and
singing
change
and
hope
They
don't
tell
us
what
kind
of
change
or
how
it
will
be
done
only
that
you
should
hope
for
the
best
By
keeping
the
hype
going
they
don't
have
to
put
anything
of
substance
on
the
table
The
only
thing
we
really
know
about
Obama
is
that
his
wife
has
never
been
proud
to
be
an
American
They
want
us
to
believe
that
his
liberal
college
professors
Rev
Pfleger
his
ties
to
radicals
Bill
Ayer
and
Lewis
Farakon
and
listening
to
the
Rev
Wright's
hate
talks
for
20
years
had
no
influence
on
his
thinking
If
they
didn't
then
who
did
He
wasn't
in
business
and
didn't
see
fit
to
serve
his
country
These
people
launched
his
political
career
and
their
organizations
received
earmarks
in
return
for
their
campaign
donations
and
political
help
They
must
have
had
some
influence
Rev
Wright's
church
received
over
15
million
That's
only
one
small
local
church
Think
on
a
national
scale
The
change
being
promoted
is
a
change
back
to
the
Carter
years
It
started
in
2006
when
the
lawyer
party
took
over
There
have
been
endless
lawsuits
and
investigations
in
retaliation
for
the
Clinton
years
It
keeps
the
lawyers
busy
but
does
nothing
for
the
economy
The
economy
has
been
in
a
downward
spiral
ever
since
Returning
to
the
Carter
years
of
high
taxes
high
inflation
and
a
weak
military
is
not
the
change
we
are
looking
for
We
cannot
cower
to
a
bunch
of
crazies
whose
only
goal
in
life
is
to
kill
us
The
old
sage's
over
50
will
have
to
play
a
big
role
in
this
election
The
young
people
simply
don't
know
what
the
aged
know
The
advantage
of
aging
is
the
knowledge
you
accumulated
You
know
what
United
States
means
You
know
what
the
seldom-heard
word
respect
means
You
know
how
wonderful
freedom
and
independence
is
You
know
the
difference
between
a
strong
and
a
weak
nation
and
you
know
what
it
takes
to
keep
it
strong
You
know
history
because
you
have
lived
it
Although
the
old
guard
is
dying
off
and
getting
too
tired
to
fight
they
have
to
muster
one
more
charge
If
they
don't
our
children
and
grandchildren
will
never
know
the
joy
and
freedom
that
is
the
bedrock
of
our
country
The
heat
is
slowly
being
turned
up
and
the
water
is
getting
hot
The
old
frogs
better
start
jumping
before
it's
too
late

A
Note
on
baseball
I
am
not
a
hard-core
baseball
fan
but
I
like
the
game
and
I
have
been
a
Little
League
Umpire
This
is
a
very
powerful
essay
I
read
it
and
thought
He
is

Y'all

to
comment
the
only
restriction
is
you
can't

me
names
The
Devaluation
of
the
Home
Run
and
a
Legend
By
Cory
Franklin
bio
In
our
daily
routine
certain
items
like
VCRs
or
typewriters
become
less
valuable
imperceptibly
In
what
seems
an
instant
they've
lost
worth
they
once
had
Include
in
that
list
of
devalued
commodities
the
home
run
Once
700
homers
was
the
province
of
only
the
immortals
Aaron
and
Ruth
and
600
that
of
Willie
Mays
Today
smaller
ballparks
shrinking
strike
zones
steroids
and
diluted
pitching
have
allowed
others
like
Barry
Bonds
and
Sammy
Sosa
to
encroach
on
this
territory
Soon
Alex
Rodriguez
will
surpass
536
home
runs
and
in
all
likelihood
so
will
White
Sox
slugger
Jim
Thome
Then
both
will
have
quietly
passed
a
player
who
was
once
the
most
revered
athlete
in
America
but
is
now
on
the
verge
of
oblivion
If
it's
possible
for
a
legend
to
become
devalued
that's
what's
happened
to
baseball's
flawed
hero
Mickey
Mantle

A
most
amazing
thing
I
was
taken
to
the
airport
today
by
a
driver
that
immigrated
from
Russia
30
years
ago
It
was
a
very
interesting
conversation
He
understands
what
the
US
needs
to
do
in
the
world
and
has
a
far
better
grasp
of
what
the
US
stands
for
than
politicians
the
press
or
intellectuals
What's
even
more
important
is
he
understands
it
is
a
moral
not
a
political
issue
He
deserves
his
citizenship
I
wish
I
could
say
the
same
for
many
of
the
rest
of
us

Culture
Fecundity
and
the
Survival
of
Society
The
primary
drive
in
all
of
biology
is
to
reproduce
It
is
actually
more
fundamental
than
the
drive
for
food
and
water
I
once
had
a
tomcat
that
was
killing
himself
from
being
on
the
prowl
until
he
was
neutered
He
would
not
eat
or
rest
but
spent
all
his
time
looking
for
females
in
estrous
The
species
that
most
successfully
reproduces
becomes
dominant
in
an
ecological
niche
Up
to
the
time
of
humans
animals
became
successful
through
evolution
from
one
form
over
time
to
a
modified
form
more
suited
for
the
niche
being
filled
Humans
however
changed
biological
modification
for
cultural
modification
and
with
that
conquered
the
globe
filling
every
available
ecological
niche
on
land
Rather
than
adapt
their
bodies
they
adapted
their
culture
to
protect
them
from
the
environment
and
to
enhance
their
survival
chances
Nature
is
harsh
and
wasteful
from
our
perspective
It
will
create
many
more
living
creatures
than
will
survive
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
best-suited
to
survive
At
the
molecular
level
genes
are
shuffled
so
that
no
two
offspring
have
the
same
genetic
components
Create
enough
combinations
and
something
better
will
turn
up
In
addition
add
mutations
at
some
relatively
low
frequency
and
over
long
periods
of
time
many
new
species
will
be
created
But
even
humans
are
subject
to
evolution
The
evolutionary
cycle
is
longer
because
the
average
reproduction
rate
is
slower
The
human
reproductive
years
are
from
around
12
to
50
In
human
evolution
that
means
that
a
woman
might
have
a
child
every
year
to
two
years
for
38
years
or
between
19
and
38
children
When
there
was
little
or
no
civilization
the
mortality
at
all
ages
was
such
that
probably
only
25
of
them
survived
to
reproduce
This
might
also
explain
why
women
have
menopause
around
50
That
is
the
oldest
a
woman
can
be
and
still
raise
a
child
under
primitive
conditions
to
adulthood
Until
civilization
50-60
was
old
Women
that
produced
after
age
50
simply
did
not
have
viable
offspring
Up
to
the
last
fifty
years
civilization
has
been
an
ally
of
nature
leading
to
reduced
mortality
and
greater
survival
of
the
species
The
command
to
be
fruitful
and
multiply
was
common
to
all
cultures
in
one
form
or
another
and
the
rise
of
civilization
increased
the
survival
rates
From
this
mankind
covered
the
planet
accept
Antarctica
where
a
much
more
advanced
technology
was
required
to
arrive
and
survive
Also
common
to
all
cultures
was
the
idea
of
a
lifetime
mate
It
is
only
in
recent
times
that
divorce
has
been
looked
upon
without
disparagement
Long
before
man
came
on
the
scene
Nature
had
created
courtship
rituals
These
could
take
many
forms
Some
were
displays
birds
seem
to
be
the
most
common
examples
of
this
Some
were
contests
of
strength
mostly
common
to
mammals
though
some
birds
will
attack
interlopers
Regardless
of
the
form
the
purpose
was
to
convince
a
female
that
the
winning
male
was
the
best
mate
Humans
also
developed
courtship
rituals
and
due
the
greater
complexity
of
the
human
mind
and
behavior
the
rituals
were
more
complex
Also
since
it
would
be
for
life
they
lasted
longer
and
were
more
gradual
The
idea
was
to
be
able
to
call
it
off
with
the
minimum
of
lost
time
and
energy
if
it
would
not
work
out
That
has
also
appeared
to
change
over
the
last
fifty
years
but
mostly
it
seems
in
the
last
ten
or
twenty
There
has
always
been
a
group
in
society
that
looks
upon
procreation
as
a
bother
nuisance
and
for
other
people
Generally
that
group
fancies
themselves
to
be
intellectual
and
they
think
that
having
children
interfers
with
their
intellectual
pursuits
Given
that
many
intellectuals
of
history
had
children
I
think
it
is
more
that
they
are
selfish
and
simply
do
not
want
to
be
bothered
with
anything
except
their
own
ends
Since
procreation
was
always
a
possible
consequence
of
sexual
activity
it
was
discouraged
until
after
marriage
This
did
not
mean
everyone
abstained
but
generally
there
was
more
fussiness
in
chosing
sexual
partners
since
there
was
always
a
risk
one
might
have
to
marry
them
Fifty
years
ago
this
all
changed
Reliable
birth
control
became
available
in
the
form
of
The
Pill
Suddenly
the
consequences
of
sex
were
no
longer
operative
One
could
have
sex
with
whomever
and
not
worry
about
procreation
It
did
not
happen
overnight
but
courtship
changed
and
became
more
a
matter
of
deciding
on
a
one-night
stand
or
not
rather
than
a
life-time
partner
Instead
of
becoming
friends
then
falling
in
love
or
falling
in
love
and
having
sex
people
had
sex
then
tried
to
sort
it
out
afterwards
In
the
meantime
the
anti-reproduction
intellectual
crowd
suddenly
could
preach
their
ideas
of
sexual
license
to
a
receptive
audience
Teens
and
twenties
with
hormones
raging
were
very
receptive
to
the
idea
that
they
could
have
sex
without
the
consequences
Since
Roe
vs
Wade
there
is
the
additional
idea
that
a
woman
doesn't
even
have
to
be
responsible
enough
to
take
birth
control
they
can
get
an
abortion
if
a
baby
happens
As
the
commercial
used
to
say
You
can't
fool
Mother
Nature
Two
trends
have
occurred
the
birth
rate
is
falling
to
below
replacement
levels
and
we
are
seeing
a
young
population
that
has
no
concept
of
responsibility
In
the
meantime
there
is
evidence
to
me
that
Nature
is
still
operating
at
the
unconscious
level
And
Islam
and
immigrants
are
reproducing
at
almost
twice
the
rate
of
the
native-born
citizens
Conservatives
are
already
pointing
out
that
Roe
vs
Wade
could
have
made
the
difference
in
the
last
two
elections
that
the
number
of
deaths
from
abortion
has
reduced
the
liberal
ranks
Overall
birth
control
even
among
those
who
don't
believe
in
abortion
has
reduced
the
birth
rate
so
that
we
now
have
too
few
people
to
support
the
Ponzi
scheme
of
Social
Security
The
trend
is
even
more
pronounced
in
Europe
My
son
says
that
in
Italy
the
birth
rate
is
so
low
that
the
government
is
offering
bribes
of
1000
Euros
for
a
couple
or
a
mother
to
have
a
child
Children
are
so
rare
in
Italy
that
any
child
is
made
over
and
fussed
over
in
a
restaurant
The
cause
is
that
people
are
deferring
having
children
until
their
thirties
when
they
are
established
in
jobs
and
already
have
a
high
standard
of
living
In
the
meantime
they
live
with
their
parents
and
get
married
in
their
thirties
or
even
forties
By
then
it
is
too
late
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
children
There
was
a
time
when
children
were
born
regardless
of
financial
circumstances
The
parents
took
on
the
obligation
because
it
was
what
was
right
The
sacrifices
were
made
as
necessary
and
it
was
part
of
being
an
adult
Children
learned
to
live
without
and
to
appreciate
small
things
They
learned
patience
and
self-reliance
They
also
waited
to
grow
up
to
get
certain
privileges
In
today's
world
children
wait
for
nothing
and
have
all
the
privileges
that
they
ask
for
There
is
no
point
in
growing
up
there
is
nothing
left
to
get
With
a
population
growing
up
self-centered
there
is
no
incentive
to
have
children
and
every
inclination
not
to
After
all
a
child
will
mean
less
for
themselves
As
we
observe
Western
society
slowly
dieing
for
want
of
responsibility
and
from
narcissism
I
see
an
attempt
of
Nature
to
make
one
last
stand
against
the
norm
As
sex
has
become
divorced
from
the
consequences
blatant
display
of
sexuality
has
become
the
norm
From
the
suggestive
clothing
has
morphed
into
the
totally
revealing
Young
girls
wear
skin-tight
knit
tops
and
jeans
and
even
pre-pubertal
girls
have
taken
to
wearing
hooker
clothes
Some
would
ascribe
it
to
peer
pressure
but
where
did
the
peer
pressure
come
from
in
the
first
place
From
the
desire
for
sex
which
ultimately
comes
from
the
imperative
to
reproduce
I
think
much
of
the
apparent
promiscuity
of
young
women
today
comes
not
from
so-called
sexual
freedom
as
much
as
the
frustration
of
incomplete
sex
sex
that
does
not
procreate
Just
as
species
died
out
as
their
environment
changed
beyond
what
they
were
adapted
for
so
will
Western
society
die
out
not
because
the
environment
changed
but
because
society
changed
beyond
what
the
environment
required

Vince
Flynn
and
pragmatic
politics
One
of
my
friends
recommended
Vince
Flynn
as
an
author
to
me
I
knew
roughly
kind
of
story
line
I
would
find
The
first
book
I
purchased
was
in
the
middle
of
the
series
Memorial
Day
The
very
first
book
Vince
Flynn
wrote
Term
Limits
was
not
in
the
series
he
developed
The
second
book
Transfer
of
Power
was
the
first
of
the
series
Between
the
two
books
he
changed
most
of
the
major
characters
and
definitely
his
premises
The
books
have
all
the
sophistication
of
a
Dirty
Harry
movie
and
are
action
adventures
They
are
a
good
read
on
an
airplane
The
main
premise
of
the
series
is
that
when
dealing
with
terrorists
political
correctness
legalism
and
formality
is
out
of
place
and
even
dangerous
the
only
solution
is
force
directly
and
specifically
applied
e.g
kidnapping
and
assassination
if
necessary
I'll
return
to
this
idea
The
attempted
premise
of
the
first
book
was
far
more
difficult
to
present
and
in
fact
I
think
he
did
not
make
his
case--that
corrupt
politicians
that
had
caused
the
death
of
others
through
their
corruption
and
political
dealings
deserved
to
die
and
that
their
murder
was
justifiable
One
of
the
main
characters
in
the
book
was
constantly
troubled
by
it
though
he
ended
up
being
part
of
the
cover-up
of
the
people
that
took
out
the
corrupt
politicians
and
their
hirelings
Even
though
Vince
Flynn
makes
his
villains
truly
despicable
I
still
thought
that
assassination
of
an
American
citizen
no
matter
how
corrupt
was
wrong
It
is
a
direct
negation
of
the
principles
of
the
Constitution
There
appeared
to
be
an
attempt
to
justify
it
with
the
principle
that
when
a
government
became
intolerable
and
destructive
of
freedom
revolution
was
permissible
Armed
revolution
is
proper
when
one
is
under
the
control
of
a
police
state
Arguably
the
Colonies
were
a
version
of
a
police
state
Read
the
Declaration
of
Independence
However
as
long
as
political
and
legal
redress
is
available
no
matter
how
difficult
it
must
be
used
when
dealing
with
US
citizens
We
extend
certain
Constitutional
rights
to
criminals
they
must
be
extended
to
corrupt
politicians
as
well
Our
system
is
founded
on
justice
not
vengeance
or
retribution
Now
let's
go
back
to
the
issue
of
terrorism
One
of
the
current
political/legal
theories
of
dealing
with
terrorism
is
that
it
is
a
criminal
act
and
that
the
perpetrators
have
the
rights
of
criminals
Vince
Flynn
confronts
that
head-on
and
first
points
out
that
this
is
WAR
not
criminal
action
and
second
that
these
are
NOT
citizens
of
the
US
I
am
in
agreement
with
both
of
these
positions
and
I
want
to
expand
a
bit
more
on
the
second
There
seems
to
be
an
implied
theory
in
some
legal
circles
including
the
ones
that
prevailed
in
the
latest
Supreme
Court
decision
on
retention
of
enemy
combatants
that
anyone
subject
to
US
jurisdiction
is
entitled
to
all
the
legal
rights
and
privileges
of
US
citizens
whether
they
are
US
citizens
or
not
This
goes
hand-in-hand
with
the
current
positions
of
the
same
people
on
illegal
immigration
But
why
should
non-citizens
have
the
same
privileges
that
citizens
have
What
have
they
done
to
earn
them
Why
should
they
bother
to
become
citizens
if
they
can
have
all
the
benefits
It
destroys
the
meaning
of
being
a
US
citizen
if
non-citizens
have
the
same
rights
and
privileges
I
don't
believe
in
some
woozy
feel-good
idea
that
all
men
are
brothers
We
aren't
until
shown
otherwise
If
some
jihadist
is
wanting
to
behead
me
the
last
thing
I
would
do
is
talk
and
embrace
him
The
first
is
to
shoot
him
Apparently
the
first
misconception
these
people
have
is
that
it
is
not
war
and
second
that
the
enemy
is
rational
Our
justice
system
is
designed
to
work
for
those
who
agree
to
certain
underlying
assumptions--that
the
truth
will
be
found
out
that
there
is
a
common
sense
of
right
and
wrong
regardles
of
behavior
that
errors
can
be
corrected
by
incarceration
Terrorists
have
none
of
these
concepts
and
to
try
them
in
a
court
of
law
is
to
make
a
mockery
of
law
It
is
applying
law
where
it
has
no
application
A
terrorist
has
only
one
goal
to
win
by
intimidation
and
the
use
of
murder
is
the
preferred
method
of
intimidating
A
terrorist
may
have
a
specific
target
but
cares
not
one
bit
about
who
else
is
killed
along
the
way--the
more
the
merrier
Criminals
are
very
specific
in
their
targeting
and
do
care
about
potential
collateral
damage
as
it
makes
it
much
harder
to
get
away
with
the
criminal
act
and
makes
punishment
more
severe
when
caught
The
current
Jihadist
terrorists
do
not
have
any
thought
patterns
in
common
with
us
They
don't
care
about
families
children
the
helpless
In
fact
they
consider
many
of
them
just
that
many
more
targets
They
believe
they
will
be
more
feared
the
more
ruthless
they
are
The
thought
of
death
does
not
deter
them--in
fact
they
believe
it
will
lead
them
more
quickly
to
their
reward
They
also
do
not
compromise--only
on
the
surface
to
slow
their
opponents
while
they
prepare
the
next
move
Given
that
we
are
at
war
with
the
Islamic
Jihad
then
whatever
it
takes
to
win
that
war
is
proper--kidnapping
assassination
spying
as
long
as
the
targets
are
the
activists
and
not
the
innocent
bystanders
Collateral
damage
should
be
minimized
but
when
unavoidable
should
not
be
a
stopping
point
This
is
where
pragmatism
shows
its
ugly
head--appropriately
There
are
situations
where
the
death
of
a
few
can
prevent
the
death
of
many
Despite
the
horror
of
the
death
of
innocents
what
happens
when
preventing
the
death
of
a
few
leads
to
death
of
many
and
is
directly
attributable
to
that
prior
act
These
questions
and
others
are
what
are
handled
in
the
series
of
novels
by
Vince
Flynn
He
has
created
a
novel
version
of
the
conservative
world
view
much
as
Hollywood
has
created
a
movie
version
of
the
modern
liberal
world
view
The
answers
he
provides
to
the
questions
are
pragmatic
not
ideological
but
they
do
resonate
in
a
conservative
psyche

Most
eloquently
stated
Quoted
from
the
WSJ
Opinion
Journal
Forum
READERS
CORNER
Mr
Korologos
misses
the
main
point
in
any
discussion
of
lobbyists
viz
if
government
did
not
have
the
power
to
take
from
some
and
transfer
to
others
there
would
be
very
little
about
which
to
lobby
For
example
there
would
be
no
cheese
lobbyists
if
government
didn't
have
any
power
over
the
market
for
cheese
The
lobbyists
are
not
the
problem
The
problem
is
that
Congress
has
with
Supreme
Court
approval
trashed
the
principle
of
limited
government
under
the
rule
of
law

Don't
Call
Him
a
Spoiler
Today
the
WSJ
Opinion
Journal
ran
an
interview
with
Ralph
Nader
Nader
is
right
about
one
thing
he
is
not
a
spoiler
the
Democrats
just
don't
get
enough
votes
However
the
rest
of
the
article
goes
into
what
Nader
believes
and
stands
for--the
USSA--the
United
Socialist
States
of
America
The
fortunate
thing
is
that
nobody
except
a
very
few
really
want
that
otherwise
it
would
be
extremely
frightening
call
him
scary

It
will
get
worse
before
it
gets
better
There
is
an
extremely
important
essay
in
today's
Jewish
World
Review
by
Caroline
B
Glick
It
is
back
to
back
with
one
by
Diana
West
What
distills
from
it
is
the
essence
of
the
problems
with
the
Bush
Presidency
and
our
refusal
as
a
nation
to
see
the
nature
of
Jihad
Also
today
WSJ
Opinion
Journal
carried
an
essay
by
Peggy
Noonan
that
is
very
discouraging
to
conservatives
like
me
but
unfortunately
very
true
We
may
very
well
arrive
at
a
nightmare
of
a
Democratically
controlled
Congress
and
a
Democratic
President
Considering
what
the
Democratically
controlled
Congress
has
done
despite
President
Bush
or
rather
in
the
absence
of
any
real
resistance
from
either
the
remaining
Republicans
or
the
President
it
is
not
hard
to
see
that
the
nation
will
take
a
really
hard
hit
politically
for
at
least
two
if
not
four
years
In
addition
there
will
be
at
least
three
if
not
more
Supreme
Court
justices
appointed
as
well
as
all
the
open
District
and
Circuit
Court
appointments
that
the
Democrats
have
managed
to
save
until
Obama
gets
elected
We
will
see
a
major
blowout
of
taxes
spending
feel-good
foreign
policy
inflation
and
then
a
decades-long
hangover
in
the
judiciary
We
may
also
as
a
consequence
experience
another
9/11-type
event
only
far
more
severe
But
we
will
have
to
go
through
all
that
for
us
to
finally
see
the
error
in
both
Compassionate
Conservatism
and
modern
liberalism
Currently
we
are
justifiably
angry
with
the
Republicans
They
have
done
far
worse
than
Bush
I
and
his
read
my
lips
They
have
completely
betrayed
all
the
principles
the
Republicans
supposedly
stand
for
As
a
consequence
we
will
throw
out
all
the
Republicans
that
we
can
In
fact
I
will
do
so
as
well
voting
against
Senators
DeWine
and
Voinivich
at
any
opportunity
The
only
downside
is
that
they
will
be
replaced
by
Democrats
who
are
unabashedly
tax
and
spend
government
power
types
However
when
none
of
their
policies
correct
what
is
wrong
with
the
country
and
are
perceived
as
making
things
worse
they
in
turn
will
be
thrown
out
That
is
the
point
at
which
things
could
become
better
Just
like
a
boil
which
has
to
come
to
head
to
be
lanced
and
healed
so
the
festering
of
60's
activism
must
finally
come
to
a
head
and
be
removed
from
the
political
stage
The
process
of
doing
this
will
be
very
painful
We
will
see
joblessness
increase
greatly
major
gains
by
Jihad
erosion
of
savings
value
cost
of
living
sky-rocket
mostly
over
fuel
costs
and
retirements
being
postponed
for
lack
of
means
to
support
them
We
will
see
morality
and
principle
come
under
severe
attack
under
the
guise
of
political
correctness
In
the
name
of
freedom
from
being
offended
our
freedom
of
speech
will
be
curtailed
To
see
what
is
coming
simply
look
at
Canada
or
Great
Britain
However
we
have
survived
terrible
Presidents
and
terrible
Congresses
Other
than
the
courts
we
can
reverse
most
of
the
damage
in
a
few
years
by
throwing
the
next
set
of
rascals
out
It
will
take
both
attrition
and
even
possibly
impeachment
before
some
of
the
judiciary
will
be
fixed
The
latter
is
very
difficult
because
the
final
arbiter
is
the
Supreme
Court
and
once
they
are
in
office
only
major
malfeasance
can
remove
them
There
may
be
moves
to
pass
more
amendments
to
force
some
issues
The
majority
of
Americans
know
and
understand
what
makes
for
good
government
despite
the
crap
they
are
taught
in
schools
these
days
They
are
too
busy
creating
lives
for
themselves
and
then
being
seduced
by
television
to
stay
in
tune
with
events
and
their
implications
But
they
also
are
capable
of
learning
from
experience
We
will
survive
it
will
just
be
very
hard
for
a
while
