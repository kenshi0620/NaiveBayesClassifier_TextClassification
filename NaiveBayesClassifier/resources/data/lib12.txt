AMERICAN
CANYON
by
Paul
Draus
The
isolation
of
the
North
Rim
has
created
a
home
for
unique
plants
and
animals
The
shy
kaibab
squirrel
an
example
of
evolutionary
change
through
geographic
isolation
is
easily
identified
by
its
charcoal-gray
body
distinct
tufts
of
fur
on
the
tips
of
its
ears
and
its
pure
white
tail
Its
close
relative
the
Abert
squirrel
inhabits
the
South

and
other
areas
of
the
Southwest

1
Defeat
The
2004
elections
left
me
feeling
burned
and
bitter
I
was
living
in
Ohio
and
that
made
it
even
harder
to
bear
I
and
a
few
other
local
volunteers
had
spent
three
long
weeks
canvassing
my
neighborhood
on
the
west
side
of
Dayton
and
making
lists
of
probable
Democratic
voters
On
Election
Day
we
were
up
at
six
a.m
to
mind
the
polls
check
names
off
the
lists
and
bring
the
stragglers
in
With
some
out-of-state
support
from
Indiana
we
went
down
to
the
wire
pulling
registered
voters
away
from
their
TVs
or
their
40-ouncers
to
cast
their
ballots
At
the
end
of
the
day
we
honestly
thought
we
had
won
This
was
before
we
knew
about
the
eight-hour
lines
at
majority-Democratic
polling
places
in
Columbus
and
before
the
unseen
tide
of
Bush
voters
rolled
in
late
as
if
on
cue
Like
many
others
I
still
wonder
how
those
extra
millions
undetected
in
any
pre-election
surveys
managed
to
rise
up
and
march
like
the
children
of
the
corn
I
still
don?t
know
if
that
election
was
fair
and
square
Did
Diebold
Corporation
of
Ohio
rig
their
machines
Were
the
polling
places
deliberately
designed
to
frustrate
and
deter
Democratic
voters
Was
gay
marriage
deliberately
introduced
as
a
wedge
to
mobilize
Evangelicals
and
peel
off
some
conservative
Democrats
All
were
possible
likely
probable
or
certain
What
the
conspiracy
theories
didn?t
explain
though
was
how
we
managed
to
screw
up
what
should
have
been
a
sure
thing
and
large
numbers
of
mainstream
American
folks
voted
for
George
W
Bush
in
the
midst
of
a
foolish
war
not
because
they
believed
that
he
was
sent
by
Jesus
to
revive
the
Holy
Crusades
but
because
they
couldn?t
cozy
up
to
John
Kerry
believe
him
or
believe
in
him
Several
encounters
from
that
time
on
the
pavement
stuck
in
my
mind
There
was
a
white
guy
who
lived
down
the
street
from
me
who
worked
three
jobs
and
was
still
struggling
to
support
his
family
He
was
a
registered
Democrat
who
had
a
sixteen
year-old
daughter
with
one
baby
and
another
on
the
way
However
he
opposed
abortion
and
did
not
know
who
to
vote
for
He
said
I
don't
want
my
daughter
getting
a
day-after
pill
without
my
knowing
about
it
But
then
he
said
something
else
You
know
what
I'd
like
to
see
I'd
like
to
see
a
working-class
guy
running
for
President
How
come
we
never
see
that
Good
question
On
another
block
two
middle-aged
black
guys
sat
on
their
front
porch
drinking
beer
out
of
plastic
cups
smoking
cigarettes
and
bullshitting
One
guy
said
Man
I
ain't
gonna
vote
for
either
one
of
them
They
say
John
Kerry
was
in
Vietnam
Shit
I
was
in
Vietnam
They
say
he
ran
away
or
somethin
when
he
got
shot
at
I
responded
Hey
John
Kerry
was
in
Vietnam
getting
shot
at
while
George
Bush
was
getting
drunk
in
Alabama
somewhere
What
else
do
you
need
to
know
Then
the
other
guy
chimed
in
with
another
good
one
Can
I
ask
you
a
question
How
come
John
Kerry
keeps
talkin
about
how
he
wants
to
help
the
middle
class
Man
I'm
poor
I
tried
to
explain
that
positioning
oneself
as
a
representative
of
the
poor
is
not
seen
as
a
good
way
to
win
national
elections
in
the
United
States
in
part
because
the
poor
don't
vote
and
in
part
because
many
people
who
are
actually
poor
consider
themselves
to
be
middle
class
But
these
observations
did
not
blunt
the
edge
of
his
question
how
come
we
can't
get
someone
who
represents
and
speaks
to
us
This
is
not
merely
a
problem
as
the
right-wing
media
likes
to
proclaim
of
liberal
culture
elitism
It
is
a
problem
of
class
a
disconnect
between
the
circles
of
power
and
privilege
to
which
most
politicians
and
those
who
fund
them
belong
and
the
real
worlds
in
which
most
Americans?in
either
blue?or
red
states?actually
live
2
Descent
Six
months
after
the
election
I
sat
in
a
wooden
armchair
on
the
deck
of
the
Grand
Canyon
Lodge
This
stately
resort
maintained
by
the
US
Park
Service
since
1937
rests
on
the
lip
of
America?s
most
dramatic
natural
wonder
Traveling
here
was
not
my
idea
I
had
seen
it
a
couple
times
before
when
I
was
in
my
twenties
usually
on
the
way
to
wandering
somewhere
else
Now
married
with
a
young
child
I
had
no
burning
desire
to
mingle
with
the
pasty
suburbanites
in
sneakers
driving
up
in
their
air-conditioned
SUVs
hopping
out
to
videotape
the
view
then
heading
straight
to
the
McDonald?s
conveniently
located
a
hundred
yards
away
But
the
panorama
of
the
Canyon
stretching
out
into
the
hazy
distance
immediately
overwhelms
any
attempt
to
describe
much
less
package
or
sell
it
T-shirts
and
post
cards
aside
the
place
really
has
to
be
experienced
This
is
easier
to
do
on
the
North
Rim
where
there
is
no
McDonald?s
Unlike
the
South
Rim
which
is
located
within
convenient
driving
distance
of
Phoenix
and
Las
Vegas
the
North
Rim
is
high
in
altitude
and
low
in
accessibility
and
therefore
has
millions
fewer
visitors
every
year
It
was
Ernie
my
brother-in-law
who
had
insisted
on
this
epic
family
outing
An
Italian-American
from
Brooklyn
he
had
traipsed
the
American
interior
while
following
the
Grateful
Dead
on
tour
years
earlier
and
raved
about
the
glories
of
the
North
Rim
Now
an
accountant
he
once
appeared
on
the
David
Letterman
Show
in
a
segment
called
Those
Crazy
Tax
Laws
he
had
the
foresight
to
reserve
cabins
a
year
in
advance
for
an
extended
collection
of
cousins
in-laws
and
kids
from
Oklahoma
New
Jersey
and
Puerto
Rico
So
it
was
that
we
had
staked
out
an
entire
hillside
of
cabins
well
stocked
with
sandwiches
and
beer
Sitting
around
the
lodge
for
hours
at
a
time
or
playing
poker
on
a
folding
table
propped
precariously
on
the
slanted
earth
between
the
cabins
was
relaxing
enough
but
it
was
not
quite
the
Grand
Canyon
Experience
that
all
of
us
had
in
mind
So
Ernie
and
I
decided
to
take
the
plunge
and
hike
in
joined
by
Israel
our
father-in-law
who
in
his
mid-60s
was
still
more
fit
than
most
men
half
his
age
We
left
the
cabins
at
five-thirty
in
the
morning
and
hit
the
trail
by
six
Normally
the
heat
would
build
steadily
as
the
sun
ascended
but
we
were
blessed
with
intermittent
cloud
cover
and
the
slightest
touch
of
rain
and
we
reached
our
destination
at
the
Roaring
Springs
2800
feet
below
the
canyon?s
edge
by
nine
a.m
Along
the
way
we
encountered
folks
of
all
ages
from
all
over
the
country
and
all
over
the
globe
All
were
friendly
on
the
trail
bonded
in
the
sanctity
of
that
pilgrimage
to
whatever
extent
they
pursued
it
We
spent
about
half
an
hour
resting
and
cooling
our
feet
in
an
oasis
created
by
running
water
and
the
shade
of
trees
clustered
in
the
canyon?s
recesses
then
started
back
up
To
my
own
surprise
my
muscles
responded
readily
as
I
entered
the
rhythm
of
the
arduous
climb
My
feet
seemed
to
unconsciously
pick
their
way
among
the
rocks
and
roots
and
I
watched
the
changing
view
emerge
around
each
sharp
switchback
like
a
masterpiece
being
endlessly
unveiled
In
those
moments
I
felt
as
though
things
were
fitting
together
body
and
mind
and
world
and
I
was
free
from
most
of
the
usual
daily
anxiety
that
dogs
so
many
of
us
pitiable
modern
creatures
houses
cars
bills
jobs
bosses
not
to
mention
Bush
the
unholy
mess
in
Iraq
global
warming
and
so
on
I
recalled
a
story
told
to
me
years
before
by
a
weathered
drifter
in
Santa
Fe
New
Mexico
He
was
an
alcoholic
who
claimed
to
carve
beautiful
sculptures
out
of
pear
trees
when
he
wasn?t
scrounging
the
gutters
for
change
One
day
he
had
visited
the
Albuquerque
Zoo
after
dropping
acid
with
a
friend
and
a
captive
bald
eagle
looked
them
both
in
the
eye
and
said
You
sons
of
bitches
You
mother
f___ers
I
clearly
remembered
him
sitting
across
from
me
in
the
homeless
shelter
where
I
worked
in
the
summer
of
1991
pale
eyes
staring
from
behind
thick
plastic-rimmed
glasses
summarizing
the
meaning
of
this
tale
with
one
simple
and
elegant
statement
The
universe
is
alive
man
After
all
everything
was
tied
together
and
the
canyon
which
we
always
imagine
as
a
symbol
of
division
actually
converges
at
the
bottom
where
the
water
is
But
you
have
to
go
to
the
bottom
to
see
that
Somehow
that
man
who
had
bitten
bottom
so
hard
and
so
many
times
that
the
taste
of
cement
and
the
taste
of
vodka
in
all
likelihood
were
forever
intertwined
in
his
addled
but
prescient
mind
had
managed
to
cut
through
all
the
sediment
that
choked
our
communication
and
clouded
our
comprehension
What
else
was
it
but
lost
awareness
of
this
fundamental
fact
that
we
all
exist
within
a
shared
organic
whole
that
cut
us
off
so
tragically
from
that
world
ourselves
each
other
3
Division
That
evening
we
drove
to
a
campground
in
the
surrounding
Kaibab
National
Forest
to
attend
a
cookout
hosted
by
my
wife?s
uncle
He
his
wife
and
their
granddaughter
had
driven
their
mobile
home
and
parked
it
out
in
the
forest
free
of
charge
rather
than
staying
in
the
crowded
cabins
with
us
A
Baptist
minister
originally
from
Oklahoma
he
now
resided
in
Texas
when
he
wasn?t
traveling
the
planet
saving
souls
for
Jesus
If
ever
there
was
potential
for
a
blue
and
red
duel
this
was
it
As
a
young
left-leaning
professor
raised
and
educated
in
the
industrial
North
I
imagined
I
must
represent
an
almost
perfect
opposition
to
everything
he
stood
for
I
might
not
be
red
I
thought
but
I
sure
would
be
meat
The
wind
was
whirling
the
sparks
around
the
campfire
where
we
gathered
in
a
clearing
on
a
plateau
surrounded
by
pine
trees
The
minister
uncle
said
that
he
had
heard
of
a
way
to
make
coffee
cowboy
style
which
involved
boiling
water
coffee
grounds
and
an
egg
together
over
an
open
fire
We
agreed
to
give
it
a
try
and
seated
ourselves
on
folding
chairs
and
tree
stumps
while
the
experiment
proceeded
Honestly
I
don?t
remember
much
of
our
conversation
but
it
was
amicable
enough
There
were
no
politics
just
the
tentative
attempt
at
communication
between
people
who
did
not
really
know
that
much
about
each
either
in
spite
of
the
bonds
of
family
My
wife?s
uncle
talked
in
a
matter-of-fact
way
about
the
life
of
a
preacher
how
it
involved
the
constant
possibility
of
having
to
move
to
the
next
position
how
his
profession
was
subdivided
into
the
ranks
of
the
big-money
superstars
the
wandering
journeymen
and
all
those
in
between
doing
time
for
the
Lord
in
parishes
large
and
small
I
realized
then
that
it
was
not
so
different
from
the
world
of
academia
that
I
had
recently
entered
and
which
was
then
subjecting
my
family
to
our
third
interstate
relocation
in
five
years
My
issues
with
right-wing
Christianity
and
my
own
mother
faith
of
Roman
Catholicism
aside
I
could
recognize
the
link
between
those
of
us
on
either
side
of
the
secular-sacred
divide
who
sought
to
reconcile
the
clash
between
calling
and
career
and
to
re-stock
our
daily
mundane
pursuits
with
the
fire
of
faith
whether
that
be
faith
in
ideas
or
beauty
or
human
possibility
or
in
a
God
whose
will
you
hope
to
know
In
that
conversation
we
also
stumbled
onto
the
potentially
inflammatory
topic
of
health
care
and
medical
insurance
and
several
of
us
myself
included
offered
some
measured
opinions
on
this
The
minister
paused
and
then
said
something
to
this
effect
I
believe
that
people
who
are
ignorant
about
something
should
not
speak
on
it
and
therefore
I?m
going
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
We
all
laughed
and
let
it
go
at
that
I
had
imagined
that
preachers
like
professors
would
love
to
hear
themselves
talk
on
any
topic
imaginable
but
sometimes
it
was
a
relief
to
not
pontificate
It
reminded
me
of
a
Spanish
proverb
that
my
wife
and
I
once
found
in
a
fortune
cookie
which
we
now
keep
it
tacked
to
our
refrigerator
It
says
En
boca
cerrada
no
entran
moscas
the
closed
mouth
admits
no
flies
Perhaps
with
such
simple
rules
we
might
all
be
a
little
more
peaceful
We
drove
back
to
the
cabins
as
the
twilight
descended
my
body
still
exhausted
and
exhilarated
from
the
morning?s
hike
my
belly
now
pleasantly
full
of
burgers
and
potato
salad
At
that
moment
in
the
crowded
car
I
felt
something
like
a
surge
of
love
for
the
world
and
all
it
contained
in
spite
of
its
conflicts
and
contradictions
My
reveries
were
interrupted
however
by
a
darting
phantom
that
turned
out
to
be
all
too
solid
A
single
deer
brought
our
happy
caravan
to
a
halt
on
the
gravel
shoulder
its
gasping
bleeding
body
kicking
in
the
grass
beside
us
The
collision
swiftly
shoved
us
back
into
the
dirty
world
of
suffering
and
death
shattered
headlights
and
insurance
premiums
However
as
we
reported
the
incident
to
a
ranger
we
were
assured
that
the
injured
animal
dispatched
by
a
plastic
bullet
would
provide
needed
food
for
the
resident
condors
still
recovering
from
near
extinction

Downtown
When
you're
alone
and
life
is
making
you
lonely
You
can
always
go
Downtown
When
you've
got
worries
all
the
noise
and
hurry
Seems
to
help
I
know
Downtown
Petula
Clark
Downtown
Just
as
abruptly
we
journeyed
from
the
majestic
to
the
absurd
It
only
takes
one
afternoon
to
drive
from
the
tranquil
North
Rim
to
the
hustling
boomtown
of
Las
Vegas
Like
the
Canyon
people
descend
on
the
famous
Las
Vegas
Strip
from
all
over
the
world
To
see
them
as
equivalent
spectacles
would
be
a
monumental
injustice
to
nature
Yet
Las
Vegas
still
stands
as
an
essentially
human
monument
of
a
kind
the
ultimate
golden
calf
perhaps
conveniently
located
just
down
the
road
from
the
vaults
of
heaven
In
spite
of
all
its
neon
noise
and
motion
however
Las
Vegas
is
something
of
a
dead
place
oriented
entirely
around
the
clink
of
coins
and
the
gratuitous
display
of
excess
In
the
air-conditioned
casino
hotels
a
cup
of
coffee
will
set
you
back
2.75
a
bottle
of
water
in
your
room
is
4.25
and
local
calls
run
a
buck
and
a
quarter
The
swimming
pool
for
our
hotel
was
about
a
mile
hike
down
a
glistening
underground
hallway
lined
like
everything
else
with
opportunities
to
spend
Did
I
mention
that
it?s
damn
hot
in
Las
Vegas
They
have
not
yet
managed
to
air-condition
the
exterior
of
the
Strip
but
of
course
that
just
forces
you
back
into
the
casinos
so
why
would
they
After
one
day
in
this
joint
I
felt
like
a
tiger
in
the
Siegfried
and
Roy
show
Get
me
the
hell
out
of
here
Fortunately
for
me
some
relief
was
found
inside
taxi
cabs
We
had
three
rides
from
three
drivers
who
hailed
from
three
different
continents
and
each
one
taught
me
something
On
our
way
to
the
Strip
from
the
airport
where
we
had
dropped
off
the
damaged
rental
car
Mohammed
an
immigrant
from
Iraq
gestured
at
the
artificial
opulence
all
around
him
and
summed
it
all
up
like
this
People
come
here
to
make
money
but
it
is
an
illusion
a
lie
How
do
you
think
all
this
was
built
The
house
always
wins
The
house
always
wins
Ishetu
was
from
Ethiopia
the
only
country
in
Africa
that
was
never
colonized
He
shuttled
us
from
where
the
celebrated
Monorail
ends
to
the
old
downtown
It
is
celebrated
it
turns
out
precisely
because
no
public
funds
were
used
to
build
it
The
Monorail
costs
3.00
to
ride
in
one
direction
if
you
get
off
and
get
back
on
it
costs
you
again
and
it
only
takes
you
as
far
as
the
end
of
the
Strip
You
would
think
a
city
train
would
take
you
downtown
but
even
the
public
transportation
in
Las
Vegas
is
a
private
cash
machine
for
the
Strip
casinos
and
they
had
no
interest
in
subsidizing
their
low-rent
competitors
who
happen
to
reside
downtown
Downtown
Ishetu
said
is
a
whole
different
world
About
this
he
was
correct
Going
downtown
was
sort
of
like
journeying
from
the
spanking
new
colony
full
of
occupying
forces
to
the
abandoned
one
that
has
now
been
reclaimed
by
natives
You
will
find
casinos
there
of
course
the
original
Golden
Nugget
and
a
cluster
of
other
seedier
spots
where
the
opening
bets
are
smaller
and
the
slots
are
looser
according
to
our
cousin
Tommy
who
wanted
to
go
there
for
that
very
reason
You
will
also
see
more
of
the
cheap
touristy
crap
of
the
Strip
with
less
of
the
pretension
It
was
hot
sweaty
and
dirty
but
overall
I
preferred
it
Fremont
Street
the
main
downtown
attraction
is
limited
to
pedestrians
and
boasts
the
world?s
largest
laser
light
show
projected
on
a
massive
overhead
canopy
There
is
also
a
giant
glowing
cowboy
who
appears
to
be
advertising
a
store
for
western
wear
but
when
you
go
inside
it?s
just
another
tourist
junk
shop
That?s
because
the
original
store
no
longer
exists
though
the
sign
has
been
preserved
in
all
its
gaudy
glory
This
sign
like
most
of
the
others
on
Fremont
Street
is
part
of
the
Neon
Museum
an
elephant?s
graveyard
of
yesterday?s
glitz
It
seemed
to
express
the
other
side
of
Vegas
the
flip
side
to
the
false
promise
of
easy
money
and
fast
fame
the
refuge
of
the
burned-out
busted
outmoded
and
rejected
After
one
more
night
in
our
vacuum-sealed
casino
hotel
we
escaped
the
Strip
for
good
and
returned
downtown
finding
our
own
refuge
in
a
no-frills
motor
lodge
where
the
rates
didn?t
triple
on
the
weekends
Our
driver
this
time
was
Sergio
a
portly
native
of
the
long
slender
land
of
Chile
He
told
us
that
the
size
of
the
Las
Vegas
had
increased
ten-fold
since
he
moved
there
but
business
overall
did
not
get
any
better
because
the
people
who
visited
now
were
cheap
tippers
focused
solely
on
gambling
and
getting
drunk
not
displaying
their
largesse
The
cab
filled
with
laughter
as
Sergio
and
my
in-laws
talked
longingly
of
South
America
My
mother-in-law
began
singing
a
song
that
she
had
learned
from
schoolchildren
in
Bolivia
while
serving
in
the
Peace
Corps
in
the
1960s
Yo
quiero
un
mar
yo
quiero
un
mar
azul
para
Bolivia
I
want
a
sea
a
blue
sea
for
Bolivia
After
three
days
in
the
sweltering
desert
I
could
definitely
sympathize
with
that
desire
We
had
to
settle
for
a
little
swimming
pool
floating
like
a
raft
in
a
large
parking
lot
behind
the
24-hour
bar
at
the
motor
lodge
The
pavement
shimmered
in
the
heat
but
as
we
held
our
son
aloft
in
the
cool
water
I
felt
that
I
was
able
to
breathe
again
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
the
North
Rim
Later
while
sitting
in
the
hotel
bar
eating
the
food
distributed
gratis
to
patrons
on
Memorial
Day
and
drinking
dollar
beers
with
my
father-in-law
I
saw
that
the
attractive
quality
of
downtown
for
me
lay
in
its
very
real
democracy
There
was
no
minimum
bid
here
no
dress
code
and
no
cover
charge
5
Declaration
In
the
wake
of
2004
we
were
invited
to
imagine
that
there
was
some
Grand
impassable
Canyon
between
those
of
us
in
the
U.S
who
drive
four-wheelers
attend
Baptist
revivals
and
watch
NASCAR
races
and
those
who
listen
to
NPR
participate
in
pot
lucks
and
read
Jane
Austen
novels
The
fact
is
however
that
such
pop-sociology
is
a
little
too
easy
and
ignores
our
underlying
humanity
and
our
shared
struggles
as
well
our
real
social
divides
and
our
complexities
as
people
I
may
drink
cappuccinos
and
still
be
short
on
my
rent
You
may
drive
a
Ford
F-150
and
live
behind
a
manicured
hedge
We
may
both
be
unsure
of
what
to
expect
when
the
next
round
of
layoffs
is
announced
when
the
ballooning
utility
bills
shrink
our
check
and
today?s
tax
breaks
steal
the
bricks
and
steel
for
the
cities
and
schools
of
tomorrow
I
don't
agree
with
the
fundamentalist
conception
of
the
Bible
or
America
I
don?t
believe
that
Jesus
wanted
me
to
own
a
gun
though
I
do
believe
he
would
forgive
me
for
whatever
I
might
do
with
it
Like
many
other
Americans
I
am
equally
skeptical
of
all
those
who
use
holy
names
and
high
concepts
for
power
or
political
gain
of
jihadists
and
theocrats
who
seem
to
scorn
the
liberal
egalitarian
society
that
I
long
for
I
don't
understand
why
those
who
claim
to
be
Believers
or
Patriots
are
not
outraged
by
the
deadly
lust
for
the
dollar
by
corporate
corruption
and
commercial
dehumanization
by
the
worldwide
growth
in
the
populations
of
the
poor
and
displaced
by
the
unnecessary
wars
that
we
fund
in
distant
lands
amid
cultures
that
we
don't
try
to
comprehend
But
I
claim
no
purity
for
myself
I
don't
wish
to
hide
behind
a
sanctified
or
pre-ordained
position
I
will
only
say
as
I
lift
my
cup
or
bottle
or
glass
in
the
spirit
of
fellowship
that
I
so
often
fail
to
find
that
I
prefer
to
cast
my
lot
and
find
my
place
not
in
the
shining
city
on
the
hill
but
in
the
downtowns
of
the
world
the
back
alleys
and
corner
bars
the
watering
holes
and
trading
posts
the
card
tables
and
campfires
the
front
porches
and
city
parks
those
cosmopolitan
places
where
the
walls
of
the
canyon
come
down
where
species
mingle
and
people
are
brought
face-to-face
to
fight
it
out
or
make
peace
or
simply
acknowledge
the
right
of
each
other
to
exist
The
mid-term
elections
of
2006
which
flipped
both
House
and
Senate
to
Democratic
majorities
were
a
relief
and
a
vindication
Not
because
the
good
guys
won?Democratic
fat
cats
need
their
feet
put
to
the
fire
too?but
because
it
seemed
to
reaffirm
the
presence
of
a
pragmatic
center
to
American
politics
populated
by
people
who
want
to
think
of
themselves
not
as
mighty
and
righteous
but
as
good
and
fair
people
who
have
limited
patience
for
incompetence
ideological
posturing
and
the
constant
litany
of
fear
Of
course
it
took
them
a
damn
long
time
to
figure
it
out
but
finally
they
yanked
the
leash
showing
they
had
not
been
brainwashed
but
had
indeed
been
sold
a
bill
of
goods
They
realized
perhaps
that
there
is
a
price
to
all
of
this
arrogance
and
bluster
demonization
and
division
Now
as
the
fall
of
2008
fast
approaches
we
are
tantalized
with
the
promise
of
a
political
transformation
and
the
potential
for
more
of
the
same
Here
we
stand
together
on
the
canyon
floor
after
eight
years
of
George
W
Bush
Perhaps
as
we
face
the
long
climb
out
together
a
movement
built
on
appeals
to
our
better
natures
to
our
shared
struggles
may
yet
prevail
Our
bitter
splits
with
the
world
and
each
other
may
we
pray
be
sidelined
for
the
sake
of
our
common
interests
our
linked
humanity
and
our
cherished
conflicted
dream
of
democracy

JUSTIFYNG
DEATH
Day
170
Why
do
men
feel
they
need
to
justify
death"-From
the
film
The
Patriot
I
was
watching
the
flick
The
Patriot
again
Its
a
good
film
starring
Mel
Gibson
and
the
late
Heath
Ledger
about
the
Revolutionary
War
Not
a
must
see
film
and
not
very
historically
accurate
but
an
entertaining
film
nonetheless
Towards
the
end
of
the
film
his
son
Heath
was
killed
by
head
villain
in
the
film
a
Redcoat
colonel
When
they
brought
his
son
back
to
the
camp
a
friend
of
his
who
was
a
General
in
the
Continental
army
was
trying
to
explain
to
him
why
he
must
continue
the
fight
so
his
sons
death
would
not
be
for
nothing
Mel's
character
responded
with
the
quote
above
And
it
got
be
thinking
Why
do
people
feel
the
need
to
justify
death
and
in
many
cases
justify
it
with
more
death
As
you
all
know
I
support
and
believe
in
this
war
in
Afghanistan
I
believe
with
my
heart
if
we
win
here
America
will
be
safer
But
even
with
that
said
I
still
don't
get
this
blood
lust
many
of
us
have
I
know
its
ironic
hearing
a
soldier
say
that
but
really
I
don't
get
it
My
dad
was
in
the
military
but
he
never
fought
in
war
my
uncle
on
the
other
hand
served
during
the
Korean
War
But
my
dad
was
an
Airforce
Cop
in
Germany
and
he
probably
saw
some
of
the
bodies
and
wounded
coming
back
from
the
front
and
one
of
the
things
my
dad
always
told
me
about
war
was
son
war
is
ugly
and
war
is
not
pretty
It
was
a
lesson
he
wanted
me
to
understand
I
mean
I
was
just
like
any
other
American
kid
We
see
war
films
and
we
wanted
to
be
John
Wayne
or
Clint
Eastwood
We
play
war
games
on
the
block
and
dad
was
cool
with
that
but
he
always
told
me
son
war
is
not
pretty
Its
ugly
He
wasn't
trying
to
dissuade
me
from
serving
No
on
the
contrary
he
was
very
proud
of
my
enlisting
and
I
like
to
think
he
be
even
more
proud
of
me
today
But
I
think
what
he
was
trying
to
do
was
prepare
me
for
the
horrors
of
war
he
didn't
want
me
to
go
in
thinking
like
John
Wayne
who
got
shot
and
got
up
again
that
war
is
like
that
And
he
is
right
When
you
get
shot
in
war
you
aint
getting
up
I
seen
the
destruction
of
this
war
I
seen
people
get
shot
at
I
seen
bombed
out
buildings
I
seen
wounded
and
I
seen
the
dead
War
is
ugly
Its
a
horrible
thing
that
should
be
avoided
at
all
cost
if
possible
I
know
there
are
times
that
war
is
necessary
I
said
this
before
Personally
I
feel
the
war
in
Afghanistan
is
necessary
but
it
still
doesn't
mean
there
couldn't
have
been
another
way
Alqueda
with
the
help
of
the
Taliban
started
this
war
I
don't
know
why
I
know
from
personal
experience
that
the
Taliban
and
Alqueda
are
evil
But
I
cant
help
but
wonder
if
they
even
grasp
the
concept
of
war
I
mean
couldn't
they
have
thought
of
a
better
way
to
make
what
ever
point
they
wanted
to
without
killing
3000
innocent
people
But
evil
is
illogical
and
thus
illogical
people
conduct
acts
of
terror
and
total
evil
And
evil
must
be
confronted
and
dealt
with
Some
say
that
justifies
our
invasion
of
Iraq
cause
Saddam
was
evil
Yes
he
was
and
if
the
people
of
Iraq
had
rose
up
like
we
did
in
the
revolutionary
war
I
wouldn't
have
problems
with
us
supplying
their
freedom
fighters
with
arms
But
there
was
no
justification
for
Iraq
WMD
didn't
exist
and
we
took
away
any
chance
the
Iraqi
people
had
for
their
own
Revolutionary
war
And
now
we
justify
what
we
did
by
claiming
we
had
eradicate
Saddam
evils
and
his
reign
of
death
Again
we
justify
death
with
more
death
This
blood
lust
so
many
of
us
have
it
concerns
me
So
many
people
are
quick
to
war
So
many
people
want
war
So
many
people
want
to
justify
death
with
war
You
cannot
justify
any
death
with
war
Death
by
it
nature
is
unjustifiable
The
wonton
destruction
of
life
mocks
the
alleged
justification
I
mean
does
it
make
any
sense
when
we
claim
life
is
so
precious
that
we
will
kill
you
to
prove
it
I
know
some
of
you
are
saying
Well
Spanner
if
you
feel
that
way
why
are
you
in
the
Army
Hell
I
bet
some
of
you
are
saying
I
knew
he
couldn't
handle
it"..You
be
wrong
In
fact
I'm
the
guy
you
want
in
the
army
cause
I
get
what
war
is
about
Long
ago
when
I
enlisted
the
first
time
I
made
my
peace
with
war
I
made
my
peace
with
what
I
was
willing
to
sacrifice
and
do
I
understood
that
things
I
may
do
may
haunt
me
But
its
a
price
I
was
willing
to
pay
cause
While
I
always
pray
for
peace
I
know
there
are
time
we
must
fight
and
someone
has
to
do
it
Doesn't
make
me
special
doesn't
make
me
better
Just
like
and
other
Joe
who
serves
while
the
horrors
of
war
will
always
disgust
me
We
are
ready
to
do
it
for
the
higher
cause
To
protect
this
nation
My
favorite
general
is
William
T
Sherman
He
was
a
civil
war
hero
who
coined
the
phrase
war
is
hell
And
if
you
read
about
Sherman
he
was
one
of
many
who
plead
that
we
find
another
way
a
way
to
avoid
war
Why
Cause
he
like
I
feel
that
when
you
go
to
war...YOU
GO
TO
WAR
You
don't
half
ass
it
You
don't
kinda
go
to
war..No
you
go
to
war
with
one
sole
objection
the
TOTAL
ANNHILATION
of
you
enemy
Why
Cause
your
enemy
wants
to
do
the
same
to
you
That's
why
war
should
always
be
a
last
resort
That
why
this
nation
should
Never
engage
in
wars
of
choice
like
Iraq
When
we
are
on
the
battlefield
one
of
my
biggest
gripes
is
they
wont
less
us
win
this
war
I
mean
we
know
where
the
enemy
is
but
because
of
these
fucked
up
rules
of
engagements
we
are
not
allowed
to
do
our
jobs
And
it
frustrates
all
of
us
I
want
to
go
in
to
homes
of
the
taliban
and
just
blow
the
living
shit
out
of
these
people
Not
cause
I
love
it
But
because
its
war
and
that's
what
you
do
A
lot
of
people
think
serving
in
the
military
and
having
a
loathing
for
war
is
a
contradiction
but
its
not
Its
a
quote
I
used
before
and
I
paraphrase
it
now
but
it
comes
from
General
MacArthur
a
man
so
many
people
called
a
war
monger
But
he
said
what
I
feel
is
the
most
profound
and
accurate
statement
about
the
military
and
war...He
said
soldiers
fear
war
the
most
A
soldier
prays
for
peace
the
most
cause
he
above
all
others
suffers
the
horrors
of
war
So
its
not
a
contradiction
We
want
peace
more
then
anyone
cause
we're
the
mother
fuckers
who
have
to
fight
it
And
I
think
many
people
don't
get
that
I
think
they
still
see
war
as
the
game
we
played
on
the
block
were
I
get
shot
and
10
minutes
later
I'm
walking
away
I
always
found
it
humorous
that
the
most
gung
ho
for
the
war
in
Iraq
are
people
I
see
on
TV
radio
and
news
print
are
almost
always
chicken
hawks
who
know
NOTHING
of
war
When
they
had
the
opportunity
to
serve
they
choose
not
to
and
now
they
want
other
peoples
children
to
do
the
dirty
work
they
never
had
the
stomach
for
I
loathe
those
people
I
loathe
them
before
I
reenlisted
and
I
have
a
deep
searing
hatred
for
them
now
that
I
am
in
the
military
How
dare
they
want
wars
they
have
no
desire
to
fight
in
HOW
DARE
THEY
They
talk
about
support
the
troops
but
the
most
they
ever
do
is
pontificate
sanctimoniously
about
how
Bad
those
who
are
against
the
war
are
Tell
you
what
I
have
more
respect
for
the
anti-war
crowd
cause
at
least
they
are
consistent
They
don't
want
to
fight
in
wars
and
they
don't
want
to
serve
in
wars..The
Chicken
Hawk
posse
want
war
but
don't
have
the
stones
to
fight
in
it
And
it
is
THEY
who
try
the
hardest
to
justify
death
It
is
they
who
have
the
taste
of
blood
They
cheer-lead
from
the
side
lines
while
kids
are
coming
home
in
body
bags
They
who
crave
death
but
don't
have
the
stomach
to
inhale
her
scent
Death
like
war
is
inevitable
But
I
believe
with
all
my
heart
that
PEACE
should
be
the
goal
Peace
should
be
our
blood
lust
cause
like
Colonel
Kurtz
said
in
Apocalypse
now
Redux
I
seen
horrors...you
have
no
right
to
call
me
a
murderer
you
have
a
right
to
kill
me
but
you
have
no
right
to
judge
me

FALLEN
COMRADES
Day
159
I
hate
fallen
comrade
ceremonies
Not
because
of
ceremony
itself
Its
one
of
the
most
moving
and
tragically
beautiful
things
you
will
ever
want
to
see
No
I
hate
them
cause
what
they
represent
Fallen
brothers
in
Arms
They
had
one
today
for
3
brothers
who
were
killed
in
action
recently
Date
unknown
but
even
if
I
did
know
it
wouldnt
tell
you
out
of
respect
for
the
families
This
was
my
second
one
I
seen
since
I
been
in
country
and
God
willing
it
will
be
the
last
We
already
had
far
too
many
this
year
hell
one
is
too
many
but
this
year
will
be
the
worst
for
us
here
But
the
two
that
I
have
seen
were
unique
and
beautiful
Makes
you
proud
you
wear
the
uniform
The
first
one
I
saw
was
when
I
was
in
BAF
Bagraham
Air
Force
base
We
was
doing
training
for
some
new
equipment
we
were
getting
so
we
had
to
stay
in
BAF
for
awhile
As
you
guys
know
I
cant
stand
FOBBITS
and
BAF
along
with
Phoenix
are
the
home
of
the
FOBBITS
So
you
can
tell
I
was
not
happy
being
there
but
the
one
thing
BAF
has
that
Phoenix
doesn't
have
is
a
good
PX
So
when
we
wasn't
in
training
we
was
at
the
PX
getting
fat
or
buying
crap
This
one
time
while
at
BAF
we
heard
over
the
PA
sytem
that
a
fallen
Comrade
cermeony
was
being
held
on
the
main
road
Which
was
named
after
a
fallen
Joe
anyone
who
wasnt
doing
anything
had
to
report
to
the
road
So
me
and
my
two
buddies
being
that
we
literally
had
nothing
to
do
went
to
the
road
and
waited
The
road
which
was
normally
bustling
with
activity
was
dead
quiet
I
never
heard
that
road
so
quiet
before
No
traffic
went
down
the
road
Both
sides
of
the
road
were
lined
up
with
sailors
Airmans
Marines
and
soldiers
Civilian
contractors
and
soldiers
from
other
nations
It
was
an
impressive
sight
Then
you
saw
a
slow
moving
convoy
of
Humvees
You
couldnt
see
what
was
on
it
but
you
knew
As
the
Humvees
passed
soldiers
you
could
see
them
go
to
attention
and
salute
When
the
convoy
got
closer
you
saw
it
The
flag
drapped
coffin
carrying
one
of
our
brothers
home
I
went
to
attention
and
saluted
the
guy
who
I
never
knew
but
also
knew
he
would
have
had
my
back
Then
I
watched
as
it
went
down
that
lonely
quiet
road
and
my
fellow
brothers
paying
the
same
quiet
respect
The
Joe
was
going
home
God
speed
May
your
family
find
peace
in
thie
time
of
mourning
It
was
the
first
time
I
ever
participated
in
something
like
that
And
when
I
did
it
I
hoped
I
would
never
have
to
see
another
But
its
war
and
no
matter
how
hard
you
can
wish
it
Probably
wont
happen
About
a
month
later
tragedy
would
strike
my
company
as
you
guys
know
when
we
lost
the
2
guys
I
knew
personally
While
the
Brigade
and
our
company
had
cermonies
my
team
couldnt
partcipate
cause
we
were
involved
in
the
mop
up
operation
that
took
place
after
our
guys
got
hit
It
does
give
me
some
satisifaction
knowing
that
when
I
saw
one
of
the
guys
who
survived
the
ambush
when
I
told
him
how
hard
we
hit
that
place
it
made
him
happy
When
we
completed
the
operation
back
at
our
FOB
I
partcipated
in
the
ceremony
to
lower
our
FOB
flag
to
half
staff
That
was
moving
for
me
cause
they
were
doing
it
for
my
guys
Guys
in
my
platoon
and
company
Gusy
I
joked
with
and
broek
bread
with
Guys
who
I
know
wear
the
black
memorial
bracelet
in
honor
of
them
Again
I
prayed
I
never
have
to
see
or
do
anything
like
that
again
But
again
its
war
About
a
week
later
we
heard
about
more
joes
getting
killed
and
obviosuly
somewhere
in
the
country
they
were
having
simular
cermonies
You
just
hate
hearing
about
guys
getting
killed
You
feel
bad
for
their
families
You
worry
about
your
own
That
constant
reminder
that
death
is
always
just
one
convoy
away
So
you
try
not
to
think
about
it
Like
I
told
you
cats
before
we
have
our
coping
mechanism
They
keep
us
sane
Today
ceremony
was
different
then
the
one
at
BAF
BAF
while
simplistic
in
its
dignaty
and
beauty
contrast
with
the
one
today
The
plaza
were
the
ceremony
was
done
had
all
the
flags
there
The
US
flag
was
at
Half
mast
All
the
joes
in
formation
surrounded
the
event
Even
soldiers
from
Romania
and
I
think
France
were
there
3
rifles
were
placed
in
the
ground
barrle
down
On
top
of
the
rifles
were
the
boots
of
our
brothers
In
front
to
the
rifles
were
helmets
and
pictures
of
our
fallen
Again
like
at
BAF
if
you
ddnt
have
anything
to
do
you
went
I
could
have
avoided
it
I'm
not
assign
to
Phoenix
just
a
transient
on
my
way
to
another
mission
But
I
went
Wanted
to
pay
my
respects
to
my
borthers
The
brigade
commander
spoke
and
he
said
some
very
nice
and
moving
words
about
troops
he
most
likely
never
knew
but
he
said
them
as
if
he
spoke
with
these
cats
every
day
It
was
nice
Then
the
chaplain
spoke
HE
reminded
us
about
why
we
are
here
and
why
their
deaths
were
not
in
vain
And
that
the
best
way
for
us
to
honor
their
sacrafice
was
to
help
bring
stability
to
this
harsh
land
Bring
security
to
the
people
of
Afghanistan
Bring
peace
He
then
ended
his
words
with
Psalm
23
Which
struck
me
cause
that
the
prayer
I
say
everytime
I
roll
out
As
he
was
saying
them
I
found
myself
mouthing
the
words
which
was
surprising
cause
I
always
read
it
from
the
laminated
card
my
mom
gave
me
with
it
on
I
guess
I
memorized
it
better
then
I
thought
When
they
completed
the
remarks
our
bros
were
given
a
21
gun
salute
The
Generals
and
Colonels
walked
up
to
the
memorial
Rendered
salute
and
marched
off
quietly
Then
most
of
the
joes
who
were
there
lined
up
and
in
2
rows
4
men
a
peice
We
marched
to
the
memorial
Went
to
atention
Slowly
saluted
and
then
slowly
marched
off
It's
beauty
is
it
dignaty..respect..honor
The
way
we
treat
our
fallen
here
makes
me
proud
While
the
country
may
not
even
know
that
we
lost
guys
as
they
watch
Dancing
with
the
Stars
or
what
ever
crap
reality
show
is
on
tv
We
stop
and
pause
Even
in
war
we
have
time
to
show
the
respect
and
honor
our
fallen
deserve
I
wondere
sometimes
if
this
war
is
worth
it.Does
America
care
I
mean
I
know
there
are
peopl
back
home
who
do
God
bless
em
But
sometimes
you
wonder
When
I
log
on
news
websites
and
I
see
the
lead
stories
is
someting
inane
Brad
Pitt
might
brakeing
up
with
Angelina
Jolie...Who
cares
I
know
some
will
say
well
that's
just
the
media
But
even
the
so
called
patriotic
news
network
and
media
sites
are
just
as
bad
Log
on
one
of
them
and
you
see
something
stupid...They
are
just
as
bad
They
talk
a
better
game
is
all
But
I
guess
it
is
true
what
I
read
on
pro
military
website
America
is
not
at
war
It's
military
is
at
war
America
is
at
the
mall
I'm
very
short
now
I
can
taste
and
see
home
While
I
pray
I
do
make
it
home
I
also
pray
I
never
have
to
hear
and
see
another
one
of
these

MY
PRAYER
Day
152
Well
its
midnight
here
in
Afghanistan
8
years
ago
today
bunch
of
thug
religious
extremists
crashed
two
planes
into
the
Twin
Towers
and
killed
almost
3000
innocent
people
They
also
crashed
a
plan
in
the
Pentagon
killed
many
more
there
Finally
in
Pennsylvania
the
Brave
souls
of
Flight
United
93
Won
the
first
battle
in
the
war
on
terror
Despite
the
fear
pimping
you
may
hear
today
Tomorrow
depending
on
time
zone
Today
is
a
day
of
remembrance
To
pray
for
our
dead
To
ask
forgiveness
and
bless
the
survivors
And
to
pray
for
World
peace
I
got
a
few
of
these
9/11
prayers
already..Some
were
great
Some
were
moving
Some
were
jingoistic
crap
that
made
me
want
to
vomit
So
I
made
up
my
own
God
please
forgive
and
bless
the
souls
of
all
the
innocents
lost
on
the
day
Bless
the
brave
firefighters
and
cops
we
lost
Bless
the
families
of
the
victims
May
they
find
peace
Bless
the
rescue
workers
we
can
never
thank
them
enough
Bless
my
city
she
proved
she
could
take
a
punch
Bless
her
citizens
yes
they
are
that
good
Bless
the
president
may
GOD
have
MERCY
on
his
soul
Forgive
those
who
used
that
tragic
day
for
devious
and
political
purposes
may
you
forgive
them
for
they
will
find
none
in
me
Forgive
me
for
not
being
able
to
forgive
them
Bless
my
soldiers
we
are
here
cause
of
that
day
Bless
my
brother
soldiers
in
Iraq
Protect
them
all
Bless
the
people
of
Iraq
May
they
find
forgivness
in
their
hearts
for
what
we
have
done
Bless
my
buddies
May
they
come
home
safe
Bless
my
friends
the
support
they
gave
me
I
can
never
repay
Bless
my
family
Your
greatest
gift
to
me
Bless
my
daughter
give
her
the
strength
to
understand
Bless
my
mom
and
dad
Thank
you
for
them
God
Bless
America
Even
with
her
blemishes
she
still
is
the
last
best
hope
for
mankind

TO
ALL
THE
PUMAS
Day
143
This
quote
comes
from
Massachusetts
Senator
and
WAR
HERO
John
Kerry
when
he
was
asked
if
the
selection
of
Palin
will
draw
Hillary
Clinton
fans
to
the
Rethugs
Well
with
all
due
respect
to
Howard
you
know
I
have
much
more
respect
for
the
Clinton
supporters
than
that
sort
of
quick
blush
take
with
I
mean
how
stupid
do
they
think
the
Clinton
supporters
are
for
Heaven
sakes
Do
they
think
Clinton
supporters
supported
Hillary
only
because
she
was
a
woman
For
Heaven
sakes
they
supported
Hillary
because
of
all
the
things
she?s
fought
for
because
she
fights
for
health
care
which
John
McCain
doesn?t
support
she
fights
for
children
and
children?s
health
care
which
John
McCain
voted
against
she
fights
for
a
windfall
profits
tax
on
the
oil
company
which
John
McCain
opposes
I
mean
for
Heaven
sakes
the
people
who
supported
Hillary
Clinton
are
not
going
to
be
seduced
just
because
John
McCain
has
picked
a
woman
They?re
going
to
look
at
what
she
supports
The
fact
that
she
doesn?t
even
support
the
notion
that
climate
change
is
manmade
she?s
back
there
with
the
Flat
Earth
Caucus
And
I
don?t
see
how
those
women
are
going
to
be
fooled
into
believing
I
think
it?s
almost
insulting
to
the
Hillary
supporters
that
they
believe
they
would
support
somebody
who
is
against
almost
everything
that
they
believe
in.-John
Kerry
I
hope
so
I
mean
from
the
people
who
I
know
were
Hillary
fans
the
things
they
loved
was
1
Track
record
2
What
she
fought
for
3
Experience
4
She
represented
THEIR
VALUES
And
after
speaking
with
them
I
believe
it..I
believe
it
was
about
the
movement
not
her
And
for
them...these...PUMAs
to
switch
side
and
support
a
candidates
who
is
the
polar
opposite
of
that
movement
Well
then
I
lose
all
respect
for
them
cause
now
your
telling
me
it
was
about
here
gender
That
would
be
like
me
voting
for
Clarence
Thomas
or
Colin
Powell
cause
they
were
black
For
the
record
I've
only
voted
for
a
black
candidate
twice
in
my
life
and
his
name
was
David
Dinkins
And
I
never
voted
for
Jesse
Jackson
nor
Al
Sharpton
for
President
Got
more
respect
for
my
vote

NOT
FIT
FOR
DOGS
Day
140
Hey
all
The
response
to
this
email
was
great
and
thanks
to
everyone
who
offered
us
sympathies
I
even
had
one
dear
friend
offer
to
send
the
cook
a
cook
book
LOL
So
anyway
I
just
wanted
to
give
you
an
update
on
what
I
saw
today
On
our
FOB
we
have
3
dogs
Count
em
3
dogs
2
of
them
wandered
on
to
our
FOB
the
3rd
we
rescued
from
our
DC
We
take
care
of
them
bathe
them
and
when
needed
give
them
medical
attention
So
to
say
they
are
spoiled
is
an
understatement
These
dogs
aren't
stupid
they
know
they
have
a
good
thing
here
And
like
all
dogs
they
eat
especially
here
in
Afghanistan
Lets
just
say
their
isn't
a
lot
of
Chuck
Wagon
dog
food
floating
around
here
Dogs
in
Afghan
will
eat
anything
that
isn't
moving
They
eat
garbage
feces
dead
rat..Whatever
Food
is
at
a
premium
Our
3
dogs
we
feed
them
our
leftovers
and
every
single
time
we
do
the
plate
is
empty
Usually
between
3
dogs
they
polish
off
the
plate
within
a
half
an
hour
So
today
I
had
a
mission
just
a
brief
down
the
road
to
the
local
base
mission
A
milk
run
That's
been
getting
more
stressful
since
the
VBIED
a
while
back..Mutha
fuckers
just
don't
know
what
get
off
to
the
side
of
the
road
means
when
they
have
a
9mm
pointed
at
them...but
I
digress
As
we
lined
up
the
trucks
I
walked
past
the
chow
hall
which
is
were
the
dog
plate
is
Now
this
is
the
next
day
Chow
last
night
ended
around
7pm
Their
plate
was
filled
around
730
My
mission
was
at
9am
the
following
day
We
have
2
big
dogs
including
a
growing
puppy
And
if
you
know
anything
about
puppies
they
eat
Here
is
what
their
plate
looked
like
at
10:45am
today
when
I
took
these
pics
after
I
got
back
Yes
even
the
dogs
don't
want
boiled
steak

WORDS
CAN'T
EXPRESS
Day
139
I
was
bored
today
What
was
left
of
my
team
hadn't
been
out
in
awhile
So
I
been
stuck
on
the
FOB
being
fucking
fobbit
I
mean
I
hate
being
on
the
FOB
Only
thing
good
about
being
on
the
FOB
is
you're
relatively
safe
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
safer
then
rolling
out
Sure
the
Taliban
take
shot
at
the
FOB
every
once
in
awhile
But
they
have
to
hit
us
with
a
battalion
before
they
ever
penetrated
this
FOB
with
the
firepower
we
have
waiting
for
them
I
want
to
go
out
and
do
my
job
I'm
a
solider
and
dammit
I
want
to
fucking
soldier
But
hey
hard
to
do
your
job
when
most
of
your
team
is
scattered
to
the
four
winds
So
after
lunch
I
decided
to
clean
my
weapons
then
mess
around
Facebook
When
your
bored
you
do
anything
to
pass
the
time
Shit
I
might
have
even
watched
DVD's
of
American
idol
or
24
if
I
had
them
Thank
God
I
have
my
porn
lol
Anyway
I
was
posting
some
Rage
against
the
machine
videos
on
my
page
when
I
got
a
friend
request
I
usually
get
a
friend
request
a
day
don't
ask
me
why
I
think
its
because
I'm
on
a
bunch
of
Facebook
groups
like
I
support
soldiers
Friends
of
the
Army
and
of
course
my
personal
fav
Fuck
Fox
News
I
don't
really
participate
in
them
lack
of
time
but
I
know
people
do
and
they
scroll
through
the
group
list
and
add
folks
When
I
get
these
request
I
do
a
quick
run
through
the
profile
check
out
pics
say
a
quick
thanks
for
the
add
and
Charlie
Mike
Army
slang
for
Continue
the
mission
or
in
other
words
just
keep
on
going
Her
pic
profile
was
a
nice
looking
older
lady
probably
no
older
then
50
possibly
younger
She
was
holding
an
adorable
little
baby
and
next
to
her
was
a
very
pretty
young
lady
Nice
looking
family
I
thought
She
was
from
England
I
was
gonna
check
out
the
rest
of
her
photos
when
something
caught
my
eye
It
was
a
short
blurb
under
her
pic
Normally
on
Facebook
people
have
their
profile
pic
but
no
blurb
But
this
one
was
different
It
said
she
had
three
daughters
I
guess
the
lady
next
to
her
was
one
of
them
and
the
little
kid
must
be
her
grandchild
she
also
said
My
son
was
tragically
killed
in
Afghanistan
May
last
year
I
miss
him
more
than
words
could
express
Man
that
hit
me
Here
I
was
reading
a
profile
of
a
lady
who
lost
her
son
in
Afghanistan
last
year
and
here
I
am
literally
in
the
same
country
I
felt
such
a
terrible
sadness
for
her
Those
words
I
miss
him
more
then
words
could
express
That
right
there
was
a
punch
in
the
gut
I
wrote
her
back
I
told
her
how
badly
I
felt
for
her
loss
and
if
there
was
anything
I
could
do
to
help
her
ease
her
pain
I
would
And
I
meant
that
I
don't
know
why
I
felt
such
a
need
to
reach
out
to
her
Maybe
cause
she
made
me
think
about
my
mom
and
how
much
I
miss
her
About
the
letter
she
wrote
for
me
on
my
birthday
telling
me
she
was
proud
of
me
I
just
wanted
to
let
this
lady
know
that
I
do
appreciate
what
she
gave
After
I
sent
the
message
I
went
outside
and
just
started
thinking
about
life
and
the
deployment
about
being
stuck
on
the
FOB
Here
I
was
feeling
sorry
for
myself
being
stuck
on
the
FOB
and
there
was
this
lady
who
would
give
anything
for
her
son
to
be
stuck
on
the
same
FOB
Boy
do
I
feel
like
such
an
ass
When
I
went
back
online
I
saw
she
replied
and
we
started
trading
emails
I
asked
her
to
tell
me
about
her
son
And
I
want
to
tell
you
guys
about
a
31
yo
British
soldier
named
Darren
Cause
Darren
is
worth
knowing
about
He
was
31
when
he
died
last
year
but
Darren
was
loved
my
many
His
mom
tells
me
that
he
was
a
Very
kind
a
people
person
and
when
anyone
met
him
they
would
never
forget
him
All
his
fellow
soldiers
loved
him
they
said
he
was
their
best
mate
Darren
also
looked
out
for
his
mom
He
never
told
his
mom
about
all
the
bad
places
he
been
to
That
hit
home
for
me
cause
I
do
the
same
with
my
mom
and
daughter
I
never
tell
them
about
the
firefights
I
been
in
But
she
also
told
me
that
even
though
Darren
never
told
her
she
knew
but
never
told
him
I
guess
all
moms
know
She
used
to
joke
with
him
about
how
if
he
was
in
battle
that
he
could
run
the
other
way
and
if
anyone
had
a
problem
with
it
they
could
just
call
up
his
mom
He
always
laughed
but
Darren
couldn't
do
that
She
said
he
was
a
brave
soldier
to
the
end
The
brother
was
the
type
of
cat
that
when
he
went
into
the
room
everyone
knew
he
was
there
and
when
he
left
everyone
knew
he
had
been
there
That
he
always
left
a
positive
vibe
Just
like
any
good
NCO
Non
Commissioned
Officer
he
looked
out
for
his
Joes
and
he
had
a
big
heart
that
there
was
always
room
for
one
more
He
was
a
funny
dude
and
a
gentle
giant
His
friends
called
him
Big
Daz
The
United
States
Army
awarded
Big
Daz
a
medal
See
a
bunch
of
US
soldiers
were
ambushed
and
they
had
no
radio
cause
it
was
the
first
thing
that
got
hit
so
our
guys
couldn't
call
in
for
help
Big
Daz
came
in
and
saved
our
Joes
He
saved
other
peoples
mothers
the
pain
his
mom
would
eventually
go
through
She
didn't
tell
me
how
he
died
Most
likely
heroic
but
at
his
funeral
over
250
soldiers
showed
up
they
had
to
stop
another
250
from
showing
up
The
streets
were
lined
with
people
and
soldiers
from
all
over
England
came
to
pay
their
respect
She
had
no
clue
how
many
people
loved
her
son
The
Church
was
over
flowing
with
people
they
couldn't
get
them
all
in
That's
how
loved
was
She
told
me
he
was
the
best
son
brother
and
dad
anyone
could
have
ever
wished
for
She
told
me
she
felt
blessed
to
have
him
even
if
it
was
for
only
31
years
She
was
his
only
son
but
she
wouldn't
want
another
Even
though
now
she
has
more
sons
cause
all
his
buddies
still
pay
her
a
visit
and
look
out
for
her
That's
how
much
Darren
was
loved
As
I
was
reading
her
emails
I
felt
like
crying
This
guy
really
was
a
great
dude
and
I
told
her
I
wish
I
knew
him
On
her
Facebook
page
was
a
picture
of
her
son
dressed
in
his
uniform
beaming
with
a
huge
smile
Nice
looking
dude
that
you
could
just
tell
everything
she
said
about
him
was
true
I
liked
him
already
and
I
never
even
knew
him
She
asked
me
to
pass
along
thanks
to
the
guys
and
for
us
to
keep
doing
what
we
were
doing
My
God
here
was
this
lady
thanking
me
I
was
struck
by
her
dignity
class
and
strength
I
knew
were
Darren
got
his
from
I
thanked
her
I
thanked
her
for
giving
us
Darren
I
thanked
her
for
saving
my
buddies
who
I
never
even
knew
I
thank
her
for
Darren
because
he
truly
was
best
of
us
cause
he
gave
us
his
all
When
I
finished
emailing
her
I
thought
about
what
she
said
about
the
pain
she
was
in
how
it
was
the
worst
pain
possible
I
thought
about
how
earlier
in
the
day
I
wanted
to
go
out
and
do
my
job
cause
I
was
bored
How
fucking
selfish
I
was
And
I
thought
about
my
mom
and
how
much
I
miss
her
How
I
want
to
see
her
face
when
I'm
back
home
How
I
never
want
her
to
go
through
what
this
lady
went
through
I'll
go
out
when
they
need
me
I
wont
run
from
it
And
I
want
to
do
my
job
But
now
I
don't
mind
so
much
being
stuck
on
the
FOB
Cause
I
want
to
get
home
to
my
mom
and
hug
and
kiss
her
Want
to
get
home
to
my
bro
and
his
family
and
squeeze
my
niece
and
nephew
till
they
cant
breathe
anymore
I
want
to
get
home
and
go
see
my
daughter
Just
smother
her
with
love
I
just
want
to
go
home
and
tell
everyone
thank
you
for
being
there
for
me
I
miss
home
Love
and
miss
you
all

HOW
DO
YOU
F'UP
SURF
TURF
Day
138
Hi
all
How
is
everyone
doing
I
was
pretty
good
until
I
had
chow
Look
I
don't
complain
much
about
chow
No
seriously
I
don't
I
mean
hey
its
war
I
track
that
Plus
its
Army
food
so
I
track
that
to
Anytime
you
get
a
warm
meal
even
if
its
dog
shit
your
happy
But
when
you
know
your
getting
good
food
I
mean
damn
you
want
it
done
right
That
cat
who
runs
the
chow
hall
is
a
Navy
cook
which
might
explain
a
lot
especially
when
I
first
got
here
they
told
me
to
ask
him
about
his
experience
with
hookers
from
Thailand...note
Ho's
from
Thailand
are
notorious
for
having
something...extra
if
you
catch
my
drift...MAN
Anyway
we
get
our
food
from
the
huge
base
that
isn't
too
far
from
here
Its
the
101's
base
They
get
their
food
and
its
cooked
by
the
assholes
from
KBR
These
are
the
cats
the
President
picked
to
run
most
food
ops
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
Its
the
company
that
is
or
was
a
subsidiary
of
Halliburton..DICK
Cheney's
Halliburton
They
charge
the
American
tax
payer
like
20
bucks
for
a
can
of
soda
and
they
are
lousy
cooks
But
the
food
itself
we
get
is
pretty
decent
like
Turkey
wings
spaghetti
I
mean
all
sorts
of
good
stuff
Now
the
key
word
is
GET..the
cooking
of
said
food
is
the
problem
Now
like
I
said
the
bastards
at
KBR
do
a
decent
at
best
totally
fucked
up
at
worse
job
when
it
comes
to
food
I
usually
get
KBR
food
when
I
go
to
Phoenix
yet
another
reason
why
I
hate
that
place
and
9
times
out
of
10
after
eating
KBR
food
I'm
in
the
bathroom
10
minutes
later
FOB
Vulcan
because
of
its
size
we
don't
have
KBR
cooks
Thank
God
but
what
we
do
have
is
that
Navy
cook
I
was
telling
you
about
With
him
its
hit
or
miss
mostly
miss
There
are
days
were
he
will
nail
fried
chicken
and
then
there
are
days
he
will
fuck
up
bake
chicken
But
mostly
he
fucks
up
the
food
But
like
I
said
its
war
and
in
war
you
cant
complain
about
the
food
and
I
don't
unless
its
surf
and
turf
night
One
of
the
things
that
surprised
me
when
I
would
talk
with
Iraqi/Afghan
war
vets
is
they
would
tell
us
that
they
would
get
Lobster
and
Steak
in
the
DFAC
Dining
Facility
I
was
like
huh
Yeah
and
they
would
also
tell
me
they
gained
weight
during
deployments
with
all
the
food
that's
available
Then
later
I
read
in
Army
Times
that
the
average
soldier
GAINS
10
lbs
cause
of
the
food
And
I
didn't
believe
it
until
I
first
arrived
in
theatre
at
Kuwait
When
I
went
to
Kuwait
the
DEFAC
was
HUGE
I
mean
HUGE
and
it
had
food
every
where
you
turned
If
you
wanted
hamburger
they
had
it
If
you
wanted
pasta
They
had
it
and
Deserts
and
junk
food
coming
out
your
ass
It
was
incredible
And
I
saw
the
same
thing
in
Qatar
The
DEFAC
were
obscene
And
if
you
was
really
lucky
and
was
on
a
huge
base
like
Phoenix
you
get
Dairy
Queen
Pizza
Hut
and
Subway
They
spoil
the
Joes
here
I
tell
ya
So
imagine
my
surprise
when
I
was
at
Lighting
My
first
base
in
Afghan
and
we
had
Surf
and
turf
Steak
and
Lobster
OH
MY
GOD
That's
like
my
favorite
food
group
And
you
know
I
must
say
the
clowns
at
KBR
did
a
good
job
with
it...Well
mainly
because
its
almost
impossible
to
fuckup
Surf
and
turf
I
mean
you
boil
the
lobster
until
its
red
and
you
cook
a
steak
for
a
good
20-30
min
on
a
grill
and
your
set
They
even
gave
us
butter...Hollah
So
I
was
tracking
what
my
brothers
were
saying
about
the
food
But
then
you
come
to
FOB
Vulcan
And
the
food
that
you
cannot
mess
up...This
guy
does
When
we
get
the
surf
Lobster
or
King
crab
legs
there
is
only
one
way
to
cook
it
well
two
you
can
boil
it
the
common
method
or
for
the
more
daring
grill
it
But
either
way
the
key
signal
that
the
crustacean
is
done
is
when
its
red
Its
like
that
button
on
the
Butter
ball
turkey
that
when
it
pops
its
ready
When
you
see
the
Crab
or
Lobster
are
red
TIME
TO
EAT
Now
the
steak
while
a
bit
more
tricky
the
rule
of
thumb
is
pretty
much
the
same
30
mins
on
a
grill
and
your
ready
Usually
you
cook
one
side
till
its
dark
flip
that
baby
over
and
when
that
side
is
done...Steaks
are
good
to
go
You
can
either
fry
it
or
grill
it
Fry
it
could
take
less
time
but
again
pretty
much
cook
both
sides
until
dark
Most
people
know
this...or
so
I
thought
Our
Navy
guy
doesn't
broil
grill
nor
fry
the
steak...Nah..Money
grip...are
you
sitting
Money
grip
BOILS
THE
FUCKING
THINGS
Yes
he
BOILS
STEAKS
HOW
IN
THE
NAME
OF
GOD
CAN
YOU
BOIL
A
FUCKING
STEAK
When
you
boil
the
steak
you
pretty
much
destroy
the
steak
Its
a
stringy
amalgam
of
beef
that
is
red
in
the
middle..Now
yo
I
like
my
steak
rare
I
joke
that
if
I
don't
hear
it
moo
its
over
cooked
But
when
you
boil
it
you
ruin
the
steak
No
ifs
ands
buts
about
it
First
it
taste
like
garbage
and
second
its
stringy
I
broke
my
fork
trying
to
cut
it
Its
a
sin
against
God
to
boil
steak
yet
this
guy
does
it
almost
all
the
time
I
think
there
is
a
passage
in
the
bible
like
Psalm
500
That
say
Thou
shall
not
boil
a
fucking
steak
so
sayeth
the
LORD
And
its
not
like
we
get
surf
and
turf
all
the
time
Once
a
week
at
most
We
GLADLY
would
sacrifice
Lunch
which
sucks
anyway
for
them
to
take
their
time
and
cook
the
steak
right
I
mean
the
ONLY
time
we
ever
had
good
food
here
was
when
our
first
sgt
had
to
cook
cause
the
cook
was
sick
I
wonder
why
Surf
and
turf...They
fuck
up
surf
and
turf
Spanner
Oh
and
for
my
Bush
voting
friends
who
want
blood
and
guts
and
don't
like
talk
of
politics
The
good
news
We
blew
the
shit
out
of
assholes
who
were
laying
IEDs
on
the
roads
on
back
to
back
nights
Hellfire
missiles
The
bad
news
EOD
Explosive
ordinance
lost
a
guy
who
was
trying
to
destroy
one
That's
all
I
got
for
now
