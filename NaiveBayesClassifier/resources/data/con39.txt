I
Used
to
Like
George
Takei
I
mean
how
can
you
not
like
Mr
Sulu
or
the
actor
who
portrays
him
But
them
I
read
this
Howard
Stern
began
his
new
satellite
radio
show
on
Monday
by
putting
to
rest
rumors
that
he
got
married
to
his
longtime
girlfriend
model
Beth
Ostrosky
Stern
also
introduced
George
Takei
as
his
new
on-air
personality
Takei
who
played
Captain
Sulu
on
the
popular
television
show
Star
Trek
and
who
last
year
publicly
said
he
is
gay
will
serve
as
announcer
After
the
first
week
he
will
record
segments
for
the
show
but
will
not
be
in
the
studio
I
guess
the
man's
got
bills
to
pay
but
going
on
Howard
Stern's
disgusting
hateful
show
seems
a
lot
like
selling
one's
soul
For
my
part
I
simply
don't
understand
how
otherwise
intelligent
and
decent
people
can
enjoy
the
filth
that
Stern
spews
out
on
a
daily
basis
And
now
I
can't
ever
look
at
Mr
Sulu
the
same
way
again
That's
very
sad

Horrendousness
From
Congress
Congress
has
passed
and
the
President
signed
a
law
outlawing
annoying
behavior
over
the
internet
Annoying
someone
via
the
Internet
is
now
a
federal
crime
It's
no
joke
Last
Thursday
President
Bush
signed
into
law
a
prohibition
on
posting
annoying
Web
messages
or
sending
annoying
e-mail
messages
without
disclosing
your
true
identity
In
other
words
it's
OK
to
flame
someone
on
a
mailing
list
or
in
a
blog
as
long
as
you
do
it
under
your
real
name
Thank
Congress
for
small
favors
I
guess
The
actual
text
in
question
Whoever…utilizes
any
device
or
software
that
can
be
used
to
originate
telecommunications
or
other
types
of
communications
that
are
transmitted
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the
Internet
without
disclosing
his
identity
and
with
intent
to
annoy
abuse
threaten
or
harass
any
person…who
receives
the
communications…shall
be
fined
under
title
18
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
two
years
or
both
This
didn't
just
pass
on
its
own
of
course
This
ridiculous
prohibition
which
would
likely
imperil
much
of
Usenet
is
buried
in
the
so-called
Violence
Against
Women
and
Department
of
Justice
Reauthorization
Act
Criminal
penalties
include
stiff
fines
and
two
years
in
prison
Obviously
it's
disgraceful
that
the
President
signed
off
on
this
It's
equally
disgraceful
that
the
Senate
passed
it
unanimously
and
the
House
passed
it
415-4
and
that
the
offending
language
was
sponsored
by
not
just
useless
busybody
Arlen
Spector
but
by
the
awful
Pat
Leahy
Ted
Kennedy
and
Joe
Biden
So
it's
a
totally
bipartisan
disgrace
Ugh

A
Great
Man
Has
Passed
Wellington
Mara
owner
of
the
New
York
Giants
passed
away
yesterday
at
the
age
of
89
He
was
a
great
man
but
much
more
importantly
and
more
rarely
I
think
he
was
a
good
man
You
can
read
tributes
to
him
from
people
who
knew
him
here
and
a
loving
article
about
him
from
sportswriter
Mike
Lupica
here
Mr
Mara
will
be
sorely
missed
There
are
few
enough
people
in
this
world
who
are
great
and
far
fewer
who
are
both
great
and
good

And
We
Wonder
Why
People
Hate
Lawyers
Check
this
out
a
lawyer
who
makes
a
profit
by
suing
companies
who
don't
charge
him
sales
tax
on
internet
purchases
Like
many
shoppers
attorney
Stephen
Diamond
buys
lots
of
stuff
online
But
unlike
other
consumers
he
sues
retailers
that
don't
charge
him
state
and
local
sales
taxes
and
is
making
a
profit
doing
it
Using
a
state
whistle-blower
law
Mr
Diamond
since
2002
has
filed
about
95
suits
in
Cook
County
court
here
against
retailers
that
failed
to
charge
him
taxes
on
Internet
sales
alleging
that
they
broke
the
law
In
cases
where
the
state
of
Illinois
joins
the
suits
and
prevails
he
is
entitled
to
up
to
25
of
the
financial
damages
with
the
rest
going
to
state
coffers
Mr
Diamond's
first
eight
suits
were
filed
against
such
retailers
as
Wal-Mart
Stores
Inc
Office
Depot
Inc
and
KB
Toys
Inc
He
has
netted
about
a
half-million
dollars
already
from
some
retailers
Because
of
settlement
agreements
between
the
retailers
and
the
attorney
general's
office
the
state's
judges
have
agreed
to
keep
the
names
of
most
of
the
retailers
and
the
settlement
amounts
confidential
More
than
80
suits
are
pending
in
Illinois
and
Mr
Diamond
has
made
forays
into
other
states
as
well
This
is
a
no-brainer
says
Mr
Diamond
a
veteran
class-action
attorney
who
has
a
scenic
view
of
Lake
Michigan
from
his
downtown
office
I
started
going
on
the
Internet
and
discovered
to
my
astonishment
that
companies
like
Target
Corp
and
Wal-Mart
were
not
collecting
taxes
on
their
Internet
sales
I
was
like
Wow
Wow
indeed
half
a
million
dollars
made
by
harassing
companies
and
costing
consumers
money
Isn't
that
grand
About
the
only
bright
spot
in
this
article
is
this
In
2003
in
Tennessee's
Davidson
County
Chancery
Court
Mr
Diamond
filed
about
30
suits
alleging
noncollection
of
sales
taxes
on
online
purchases
by
Wal-Mart
Target
Amazon.com
Inc
PetsMart
Inc
and
Bass
Pro
Shops
among
other
companies
But
he
didn't
reckon
on
the
reaction
of
Loren
Chumley
Tennessee's
commissioner
of
revenue
who
wasn't
happy
that
a
private
citizen
was
using
the
whistle-blower
law
to
enrich
himself
Viewing
Mr
Diamond
as
an
opportunist
exploiting
a
legal
loophole
Ms
Chumley
immediately
set
out
to
change
state
law
She
succeeded
and
the
cases
were
dismissed
Ms
Chumley
says
that
Mr
Diamond
was
misusing
the
law
Mr
Diamond
counters
that
Tennessee
wasn't
being
aggressive
enough
in
collecting
taxes
Good
for
Ms
Chumley
It
isn't
for
this
bottom-feeding
vermin
from
Chicago
to
judge
whether
other
states
governments
aren't
being
aggressive
enough
in
collecting
taxes
Oh
there
is
one
other
bright
spot
the
state
of
Illinois
doesn't
want
to
pay
the
aforementioned
bottom-feeding
vermin
what
he
believe
he's
entitled
to
In
Illinois
meanwhile
Mr
Diamond
is
fighting
with
the
state
over
his
share
of
the
proceeds
in
cases
involving
some
big
retailers
he
sued
Last
year
the
attorney
general's
office
negotiated
a
2.4
million
settlement
with
Wal-Mart
Target
and
Office
Depot
about
uncollected
sales
taxes
dating
back
to
1999
Mr
Diamond
says
that
since
he
did
all
the
legwork
he
is
entitled
to
the
full
25
share
plus
any
costs
he
incurred
which
is
allowable
under
the
law
But
the
attorney
general's
office
wants
to
pay
him
less
than
25
and
nothing
for
his
costs
Unbelievable

Are
They
Actively
Trying
to
Wreck
the
Economy
It's
hard
to
explain
this
any
other
way
Owning
a
home
may
become
less
tax-friendly
than
it
has
been
if
suggestions
from
the
president's
tax-reform
panel
are
considered
seriously
by
Congress
in
the
next
year
or
so
What
do
they
want
to
do
The
panel
hasn't
made
any
firm
decisions
about
what
it
will
propose
in
its
final
report
due
Nov
1
But
it
is
considering
a
number
of
options
Among
them
Reducing
from
1
million
the
size
of
a
mortgage
on
which
interest
may
be
deducted
If
such
a
proposal
were
made
it's
possible
that
the
mortgage
size
would
vary
by
region
depending
on
local
home
prices
Replacing
the
mortgage-interest
deduction
with
a
tax
credit
allowing
all
homeowners
with
a
mortgage
to
get
a
tax
break
not
just
those
who
itemize
Reducing
the
tax
rate
at
which
mortgage
interest
may
be
deducted
Likely
a
proposed
rate
would
be
a
middle-income
tax
rate
such
as
15
percent
or
25
percent
That
would
preserve
the
benefits
of
homeownership
for
middle-income
taxpayers
Poterba
said
Screwing
with
the
mortgate-interest
deduction
seems
like
a
really
good
way
to
damage
if
not
outright
ruin
the
housing
marke
especially
in
combination
with
rising
interest
rates
and
the
growing
popularity
of
interest-only
mortgages
which
according
to
statistics
I've
read
about
1/3
of
all
new
mortgages
are
Why
is
this
troubling
Since
you'll
be
qualified
based
on
the
interest-only
payment
and
will
likely
refinance
before
the
interest-only
term
expires
anyway
it
could
be
a
way
to
effectively
lease
your
dream
home
now
and
invest
the
principal
portion
of
your
payment
elsewhere
while
realizing
the
tax
advantages
and
appreciation
that
accompany
homeownership
The
concept
is
not
a
new
one
back
in
the
Roaring
Twenties
interest-only
mortgages
were
commonplace
At
the
end
of
the
term
homeowners
typically
refinanced
The
system
worked
great
unless
your
home
lost
value
or
you
lost
your
job
Which
is
exactly
what
happened
when
the
Great
Depression
hit
Foreclosures
skyrocketed
and
lenders
abruptly
stopped
writing
interest-only
loans
The
practice
has
continued
elsewhere
however
notably
in
Great
Britain
emphasis
mine
Hmm…homes
losing
value
I
wonder
if
rising
interest
rates
potentially
major
and
costly-to-homeowner
tax
changes
gasoline
prices
double
or
more
what
they
were
a
year
ago
home
heating
prices
that
are
likely
to
skyrocket
this
winter
a
series
of
unprecedentedly-costly
natural
disasters
consumer
uneasiness
and
the
possible
disappearance
of
employee
pensions
throughout
entire
industries
like
say
the
airlines
or
auto
manufacturers)…might
lead
to
some
reluctance
on
the
part
of
consumers
to
purchase
new
homes
leading
to
the
end
of
seemingly-ever-increasing
home
values
So
what
will
happen
to
all
the
people
who
bought
homes
using
mortgages
that
can
only
be
maintained
if
the
value
of
their
home
keeps
rising
indefinitely
What
will
happen
to
the
banks
that
loaned
them
the
money
I
believe
the
answer
was
mentioned
above
in
bold
type
It's
not
like
it
hasn't
happened
in
this
country
before
after
all
It
would
just
be
nice
if
our
leaders
weren't
making
policies
that
seem
designed
to
encourage
a
new
Great
Depression

Wisdom
for
the
Day
So
while
talking
with
a
co-worker
I
thought
of
an
old
saying
I
remembered
which
illustrated
the
point
I
was
trying
to
make
As
I
sometimes
do
I
mangled
the
original
saying
a
bit
but
honestly
I
think
my
version
works
better
Don't
try
to
teach
a
pig
to
dance
You'll
only
get
dirty
and
you'll
annoy
the
pig
Which
leads
of
course
to
the
shorthand
phrase
which
I
think
is
probably
applicable
in
many
if
not
most
areas
of
life
Pigs
don't
dance
For
purposes
of
historical
accuracy
the
actual
saying
is
You
can't
teach
a
pig
to
sing
It's
a
waste
of
time
and
it
annoys
the
pig
As
I
said
I
like
my
version
better
Whenever
you're
thinking
of
doing
something
that's
pointless
and
impossible
to
succeed
at
just
remember
pigs
don't
dance

Most
Pointless
and
Uninformative
Headline
of
All
Time
From
today's
Washington
Post
The
big
banner
headline
Bush
Defends
Supreme

Pick
Well
duh
Is
that
in
any
way
news
that
a
President
would
defend
the
person
he
selected
for
the
Supreme
Court
Is
it
in
the

unexpected
or
surprising
Was
there
really
nothing

even
