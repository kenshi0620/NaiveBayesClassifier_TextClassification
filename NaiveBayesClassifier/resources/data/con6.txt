New
Blog
I've
just
started
a
new
blog
about
Eliot
Spitzer
Check
it
out
Here's
my
intro
post
Welcome
to
Spitzer
Watch
Eliot
Spitzer
is
my
Attorney
General
but
he
doesn't
have
my
interests
at
heart
Instead
he
has
wasted
state
resources
to
advance
his
political
career
and
to
usurp
the
legislative
process
to
create
policy
that
would
never
be
passed
by
normal
legislative
means
He
accomplishes
this
by
blackmailing
companies
and
industries
with
the
threat
of
lawsuits
and
by
tactfully
using
the
media
to
spread
rumors
that
advance
his
agenda
Now
Eliot
Spitzer
is
running
for
Governor
without
most
potential
voters
knowing
the
truth
of
Attorney
General
Spitzer's
hypocrisy
This
blog
will
be
dedicated
to
exposing
that
hypocrisy

Diversity
is
what
Some
of
us
at
Colby
have
tried
to
challenge
the
dogmatic
belief
in
diversity
that
consumes
Colby
and
many
other
elite
college
campuses
the
debate
club
at
Colby
College
in
Waterville
Maine
invited
me
to
debate
the
role
of
diversity
in
higher
education
with
they
hoped
the
president
of
the
College
William
Adams
In
all
the
debate
club
invited
13
members
of
the
administration
and
the
faculty
to
debate
me
They
all
declined
President
Bro
who
was
given
an
open-ended
invitation
to
set
the
date
said
that
he
was
too
busy
and
needed
more
time
to
prepare
than
he
had
available
The
other
administrators
who
in
the
words
of
one
of
the
students
make
their
living
off
of
diversity
just
flat-out
refused
Now
the
Princeton
Review
has
released
part
of
its
criteria
for
determining
if
a
university
is
diverse
or
monochromatic

Now
1,2
and

make
sense
to
me
but
Students

on
a
Regular
Basis
is
diversity
Seems
to
me
that
real
diversity
is
some
Students
Ignore
God
on
a
Regular
Basis
while
other
Students
Pray
on
a
Regular
Basis
Or
how
about
Students
have
a
wide
range
of
religious
beliefs
Just
another
example
of

Academia's

Crackdown
on
Designated
Drivers
In
possibly
the
most
idiotic
stance
I've
ever
heard
of
the
Waterville
Police
Chief
and
his
Deputy
have
vowed
to
crack
down
on
designated
drivers
The
increase
in
alcohol-related
incidents
have
prompted
police
to
crack
down
on
designated
drivers
by
vowing
to
charge
them
with
furnishing
a
place
for
minor
to
consume
according
to
both
police
Chief
John
E
Morris
and
Deputy
Chief
Joseph
P
Massey
Furnishing
a
place
for
minors
to
consume
is
a
criminal
offense
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
minimum
of
500
and
possible
jail
time
according
to
police.What
justification
did
the
police
give
for
this
stance
The
number
of
alcohol-related
cases
associated
with
Colby
students
has
been
on
the
rise
Morris
said
Monday
My
fear
is
that
we're
heading
toward
a
significant
injury
or
death
by
students
who
are
binge
drinking
It
appears
that
all
of
the
police
and
Colby
efforts
in
the
area
of
education
are
failing."I
spoke
personally
with
Waterville
Mayor
Paul
LePage
who
implied
that
if
the
statements
were
true
he
strongly
disagreed
with
them
Mayor
LePage
agreed
that
cracking
down
on
designated
drivers
was
no
way
to
avoid
what
the
Chief
described
as
a
significant
injury
or
death
by
students
who
are
binge
drinking
This
Police
Chief
is
not
one
who
has
particularly
progressive
views
on
drinking
policies
Later
in
the
same
article
the
police
chief
criticizes
the
much
publicized
new
policy
of
Colby
to
allow
students
over
21
to
have
up
to
2
drinks
with
dinner
on
selected
Fridays
Colby
recently
instituted
a
policy
whereby
students
21
and
older
may
drink
up
to
two
glasses
of
wine
or
up
to
two
beers
on
Friday
nights
in
a
special
dining
room
near
the
main
dining
hall
School
officials
say
the
practice
is
an
innovative
approach
designed
to
change
the
culture
to
normalize
the
behavior
and
take
it
out
of
the
realm
of
binge
drinking
or
risky
behavior
The
practice
is
counter
to
the
Just
Say
No
approach
Deputy
Chief
Massey
does
not
think
allowing
students
to
drink
at
dinner
is
the
answer.Hopefully
the
mayor
will
act
to
stop
his
out
of
control
police
chief
from
putting
into
effect
this
awful
policy

there
are

I

off

which
the

No

which
I
take

to
every

weekend
Get
the

out
of
your
ass
and
realize
that
3.125673
of
all
Colby
students
give
a
flying
fuck
about
what
you
have
to
say
Furthermore
99.999999
of
Colby
students
probably
think
your
a
fucking
dumbass
You
are
the
most
arrogant
piece
of
shit
that
I
have
heard
of
In
fact
the
shit
that
comes
out
of
my

has
more
humility
than
you
do
you

Apples

As
FIRE
points
out
on
their

speechcodes.org
Colby
has
a
very
restrictive
speech
code
While
the
concept
of
speech
codes
is
something
that
troubles
me
greatly
I
hope
to
see
Colby
enforce
its
speech
code
in
this
case
as
the
only
thing
worse
than
a
restrictive
speech
code
is
one
that
is
only

Rock

this

What
are
they
teaching
the
children
U.S
students
say
press
freedoms
go
too
far
One
in
three
U.S
high
school
students
say
the
press
ought
to
be
more
restricted
and
even
more
say
the
government
should
approve
newspaper
stories
before
readers
see
them
according
to
a
survey
being
released
today
The
survey
of
112,003
students
finds
that
36
believe
newspapers
should
get
government
approval
of
stories
before
publishing
51
say
they
should
be
able
to
publish
freely
13
have

Asked
whether
the

enjoys

much

not

or
about
the

amount
32
say
too
much
and
37
say
it

amount
Ten

Foundation

conducted
last

by

It
also
questioned

The
findings
aren't

to
Jack
Dvorak

are
often
unaware

of

of

election

Bush
has
done
a
terrible
job
of
selling
his
Social
Secutity
reform
Here's
what
he
needs
to
remind
people
Social
Security
in
its
current
form
is
a
pay
as
you
go
Wealth
Transfer
not
as
many
believe
a
pension-type
savings
plan
When
Social
Security
started
there
was
1
retiree
to
16
workers
and
the
Social
Security
tax
was
2
with
a
cap
at
just
60
Currently
it
is
down
to
3
to
1
with
a
tax
rate
of
12.4
and
after
the
baby
boomers
retire
it
will
be
2
to
1
This
is
not
sustainable
without
a
50
increase
on
payroll
taxes
the
most
regressive
tax
America
has
The
Social
Security
Trustees
report
of
2003
stated
that
the
financial
shortfall
that
Social
Security
will
have
was
already
10.5
trillion
dollars
apporximantly
our
entire
annual
GDP
and
that
number
will
grow
larger
every
year
the
current
system
remains

Being

O'Rourke's

of
Whores
seemed
appropriate
Buy
it
on

for
just
1
cent
On
God
and
Santa
Clause
I
have
only
one
firm
belief
about
the
American
political
system
and
that
is
this
God
is
a
Republican
and
Santa
Claus
is
a
Democrat
God
is
an
elderly
or
at
any
rate
middle-aged
mate
a
stern
fellow
patriarchal
rather
than
paternal
and
a
great
believer
in
rules
and
regulations
He
holds
men
strictly
accountable
for
their
actions
He
has
little
apparent
concern
for
the
material
well-being
of
the
disadvantaged
He
is
politically
connected
socially
powerful
and
holds
the
mortgage
on
literally
everything
in
the
world
God
is
difficult
God
is
unsentimental
It
is
very
hard
to
get
into
God's
heavenly
country
club
Santa
Claus
is
another
matter
He's
cute
He's
nonthreatening
He's
always
cheerful
And
he
loves
animals
He
may
know
who's
been
naughty
and
who's
been
nice
but
he
never
does
anything
about
it
He
gives
everyone
everything
they
want
without
thought
of
a
quid
pro
quo
He
works
hard
for
charities
and
he's
famously
generous
to
the
poor
Santa
Claus
is
preferable
to
God
in
every
way
but
one
There
is
no
such
thing
as
Santa
Claus."1

Final
Election
Thoughts
The
NY
Times
and
3rd
Parties
After
the
Nader
effect
on
the
2000
Presidential
election
where
Ralph
Nader
won
enough
votes
that
he
likely
changed
the
outcome
of
the
election
I
would
have
hoped
for
better
media
coverage
of
3rd
parties
during
the
2004
election
I
would
be
disappointed
Ultimately
while
there
was
more
attention
paid
to
Nader
than
before
this
coverage
was
not
a
substantive
look
at
any
of
Nader's
policies
but
instead
consisted
of
reports
about
the
polls
and
the
possibility
of
Nader
playing
spoiler
Meanwhile
the
other
third
party
candidates
received
relatively
no
media
attention
even
compared
to
what
was
received
by
Ralph
Nader
Odd
given
that
3
candidates
were
on
more
ballots
than
Nader
A
search
of
the
New
York
Times
for
the
month
before
the
election
10/2/04-11/2/04
revealed
the
following
Ralph
Nader
was
mentioned
in
72
articles
well
over
an
average
of
two
per
day
Libertarian
Candidate
Michael
Badnarik
was
mentioned
in
2
articles
Green
Party
Candidate
David
Cobb
received
one
mention
Constitution
Party
Candidate
Michael
Petrouka
was
never
mentioned
He
was
only
mentioned
once
in
the
previous
year
on
August
28
2004
The
coverage
of
Nader
and
what
little
coverage
the
others
recieved
was
of
low
quality
Only
one
article
in
the
Voter
guide
mentioned
any
policy
proposals
The
rest
explored
the
spoiler
possibilities
or
Nader's
battles
to
get
on
ballots
The
lack
of
attention
given
to
Badnarik
seemed
to
be
the
result
of
a
blind
spot
for
the
national
media
Badnarik
was
on
the
ballot
in
48
states
plus
Washington
DC
as
compared
to
only
34
state
ballots
that
Nader
appeared
on
In
addition
Badnarik
received
just
over
400,000
votes
as
compared
to
Nader's
approximately
503,000
Given
Badnarik's
receiving
of
80
of
the
vote
total
that
Nader
received
the
36
to
1
ratio
in
New
York
Times
coverage
in
favor
of
Ralph
Nader
is
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
New
York
Times
One
day
maybe
the
NY
Times
will
take
the
lead
and
cover
candidates
who
could
inject
new
ideas
into
Washington
Until
then
the
best
chance
might
be
to
include
3rd
Party
candidates
in
the
Presidential
debates

Merry
Christmas
or
is
it
Happy
Festivus
And
now
a
Christmas
Carol
Ayn
Rand
Style
The
ruggedly
handsome
and
weirdly
articulate
Ebenezer
Scrooge
is
a
successful
executive
held
back
by
the
corrupt
morality
of
a
society
that
hates
success
and
fails
to
understand
the
value
of
selfishness
So
Scrooge
explains
that
value
in
a
272-page
soliloquy
Deep
down
Scrooge's
enemies
know
that
he
is
right
but
they
resent
him
out
of
a
sense
of
their
own
inferiority
Several
hot
sex
scenes
and
unlikely
monologues
later
Scrooge
triumphs
over
all
adversity
except
a
really
mean
review
by
Whittaker
Chambers
Meanwhile

Who
said
genocide
can't
be
funny
While
some
like
fellow
Colby
blogger
Mayflower
Hill
go
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
about
the
Genocide
in
Sudan
Some
people
see
a
bit
of
humor
in
all
the
madness
Nigeria
Chosen
To
Host
2008
Genocides
ABUJA
NIGERIA
At
a
celebratory
press
conference
Monday
President
Olusegun
Obasanjo
announced
that
Nigeria's
troubled
but
oil-rich
city
of
Warri
has
been
chosen
to
host
the
2008
Genocides
Nigeria
is
excited
for
this
chance
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
Somalia
Rwanda
and
Sudan
Obasanjo
said
Much
work
remains
to
be
done
but
all
of
the
building
blocks
are
in
place
Nigeria
has
many
contentious
ethnic
groups
a
volatile
economy
and
a
dependence
on
food
imports
We
are
well
on
our
way
to
making
2008
a
genocidal
year
to
remember
in
Nigeria
Obasanjo
acknowledged
that
many
people
considered
Nigeria
a
relatively
stable
West
African
nation
an
unlikely
candidate
to
host
the
Genocides
Sudan
was
a
fantastic
host
this
year
the
2004
Genocides
have
really
raised
the
bar
Radhiya
said
For
2008
many
of
us
on
the
committee
had
our
eyes
on
Tajikistan
The
country's
ongoing
ethnic
and
religious
strife
made
it
a
strong
contender
But
there
was
some
concern
that
the
conflict
was
as
likely
to
simmer
down
as
it
was
to
boil
over."And
of
course
the
picture

Bjorn
Lomborg
pens
an
Op-Ed
for
the
UK
Guardian
Save
the
world
ignore
global
warming
Here's
the
key
passage
Global
warming
is
real
and
caused
by
CO2
The
trouble
is
that
the
climate
models
show
we
can
do
very
little
about
the
warming
Even
if
everyone
including
the
United
States
did
Kyoto
and
stuck
to
it
throughout
the
century
the
change
would
be
almost
immeasurable
postponing
warming
by
just
six
years
in
2100
Likewise
the
economic
models
tell
us
that
the
cost
is
substantial
The
cost
of
Kyoto
compliance
is
at
least
150billion
a
year
For
comparison
the
UN
estimates
that
half
that
amount
could
permanently
solve
the
most
pressing
humanitarian
problems
in
the
world
it
could
buy
clean
drinking
water
sanitation
basic
health
care
and
education
to
every
single
person
in
the
world

Something

What's
that
terrible
smell
It's
coming
from
a
hatred
of
the
United
States
that
has
become
so
strong
that
it
has
overpowered
any
lingering
attachment
to
the
ideas
of
liberty
on
which
the
United

was
founded
Lewrockwell.com
and

More
Wine
Sir
Blogging
will
be
light
for
the
next
week
as
I
take
my
finals
But
for
now
The
WSJ
has
this
article
about
the
recent
Supreme
Court
Wine
Case
Here's
a
nice
quote
Needless
to
say
the
state
liquor
cartels
aren't
happy
at
the
prospect
of
being
cut
out
as
middlemen
in
this
lucrative
business
But
the
arguments
they
muster
are
as
weak
as
a
white-wine
spritzer
One
is
taxation
states
may
lose
tax
revenue
if
consumers
can
purchase
wine
over
the
Internet
Yes
that
could
happen
since
Congress
has
enacted
a
moratorium
on
taxes
on
Internet
sales
across
state
lines
But
why
should
wine
be
any
different
from
every
other
product
sold
online
You
know
the
liquor
lobbies
are
really
desperate
however
when
they
argue
that
direct
wine
sales
would
make
it
easier
for
minors
to
obtain
alcohol
Kids
these
days
are
precocious
but
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
teenager
using
dad's
credit
card
to
order
20
bottles
of
wine
for
a
party
a
couple
of
weeks
from
now
In
any
event
measures
already
in
place
for
blocking
intra-state
wine
shipments
to
minors
could
easily
be
extended
to
interstate
sales.They
do
a
nice
job
of
pointing
out
the
dangers
of
letting
states
regulate
inter-state
commerce
If
the
Supreme
Court
lets
states
impose
restrictions
on
wine
sales
watch
for
curbs
on
other
products
sold
online
A
negative
ruling
could
affect
all
Internet
commerce
in
which
a
state
can
express
a
regulatory
concern
Think
automobiles
or
insurance
or
contact
lenses
Federal
appeals
courts
in
three
circuits
have
struck
down
bans
on
direct
shipment
of
wine
two
others
have
upheld
the
ban
So
now
it's
up
to
the
Supremes
to
decide
whether
the
Founders
meant
to
exclude
wine
when
they
wrote
the
Commerce
Clause
requiring
free
trade
among
states

Wine
Protectionism
and
the
Commerce
Clause
Slate
has
a
great
article
summing
up
the
cases
Granholm
v
Heald
No
03-1116
Michigan
Beer
Wine
Wholesalers
Association
v
Heald
No
03-1120
and
Swedenburg
v
Kelly
No
03-1274
which
the
Supreme
Court
heard
Tuesday
Michigan
and
New
York
allow
their
respective
in-state
wineries
to
ship
their
wines
directly
to
customers
Both
states
make
it
virtually
impossible
for
out-of-state
vineyards
to
do
the
same
So
that
was
the
interesting
part
The
states
justify
their
tough-on-wine
stance
by
stating
that
wine
is
different
from
other
products
that
properly
move
about
freely
in
interstate
commerce
And
they
find
textual
justification
for
this
idea
in
the
21st
Amendment
which
provides
that
The
transportation
or
importation
into
any
State
Territory
or
possession
of
the
United
States
for
delivery
or
use
therein
of
intoxicating
liquors
in
violation
of
the
laws
thereof
is
hereby
prohibited
The
21st
Amendment
effectively
repealed
Prohibition
in
1933
and
for
a
time
the
courts
treated
it
as
though
it
gave
the
states
power
to
regulate
any
and
all
alcohol
for
any
and
all
reasons
unencumbered
by
the
commerce
clause
or
any
other
discernible
legal
doctrine
The
commerce
clause
or
more
precisely
today
the
unwritten
or
dormant
part
of
the
commerce
clause
is
a
fuzzy
little
doctrine
that
bars
states
from
enacting
protectionist
discriminatory
measures
against
interstate
commercial
activity
That
was
the
deadly
boring
part
Things
liven
up
again
when
you
understand
that
this
case
comes
down
to
two
weird
constitutional
doctrines
duking
it
out
for
world
dominance
and
that
everything
will
turn
on
whether
you
read
the
21st
Amendment
as
more
compelling
than
the
commerce
clause
or
less
so.The
Fall
04
issue
of
Regulation
Magazine
has
an
article
about
a
study
which
concludes
At
the
heart
of
the
debate
is
a
simple
question
Do
state
restrictions
on
direct
interstate
shipment
stem
from
public
welfare
concerns
or
economic
interests?Our
study
suggests
economic
interests
in
both
the
private
and
public
sectors
are
the
principal
drivers
of
restrictions
on
direct
interstate
shipping
of
wine
Those
results
have
immediate
consequence
for
the
legal
battles
raging
across
the
country
contesting
the
constitutionality
of
direct
shipment
laws
To
the
extent
that
public
welfare
interests
are
required
by
courts
to
justify
states
restrictions
on
interstate
commerce
our
results
cast
a
shadow
of
doubt
on
public
interest
arguments
in
the
instance
of
direct
shipment
of
wine
They
also
raise
questions
about
similar
restrictions
on
direct
interstate
shipping
of
other
alcohol
products
particularly
specialty
microbrew
beers
that
face
similar
distribution
hurdles
In
otherwords
this
is
state-vs.-state
protectionism
plain
and
simple
Hopefully
when
they
announce
their
decision
in
July
the
Supreme
Court
will
conclude
the
same

Gay
Marriage
is
Conservative
It
seems
Andrew
Sullivan
and
others
who
argued
that
Gay
Marriage
was
conservative
were
right
Now
that
Gay
Marriage
is
legal
in
Massachusetts
unmarried
gay
couples
are
being
kicked
off
same-sex
partner
benefits
and
given
the
choice
1
Be
treated
like
any
non-married
heterosexual
without
non-married
partners
getting
health
and
other
benefits
or
2
Make
the
commitment
to
one
partner
and
tie
the
knot
just
like
anyone
else
But
some
gay
activists
don't
like
that
choice
To
them
Sullivan
says
Stop
whining
Personally
I
have
debated
at
the
Heritage
Foundation
against
the
Federal
Marriage
Amendment
Heritage
represented
the
Pro
side
and
I
still
feel
the
most
consistent
and
fair
solution
to
this
debate
is
one
that
has
never
really
been
discussed
and
is
currently
politically
impossible
The
government
needs
to
get
out
of
the
business
of
confering
the
status
of
marriage
Leave
marriage
to
religious
institutions
and
to
lawyers
who
can
create
contracts
between
any
two
people
This
would
mean
ending
marriage
benefits
like
joint
tax
returns
but
that
problem
could
be
solved
with
a
FLAT
TAX
I
for
one
would
like
to
see
this
idea
discussed
more
in
the
marketplace

ideas
