There
are
a
lot
of
scary
things
in
this
world
but
one
of
the
scariest
is
that
Halloween
and
the
Presidential
election
are
only
five
days
apart
It?s
hard
to
miss
the
parallel
between
tricks-and-treats
and
the
promises-and-panderings
of
politicians
masquerading
as
the
most
caring
most
vital
most
sincere
candidate
While
standing
behind
their
lapel
flag
buttons
they
are
quick
to
dress
their
opponents
in
something
less
patriotic
The
Republican
right
wing
wants
to
dress
Barack
Obama
as
a
socialist
terrorist
putting
on
him
a
large
black
beard
a
kufi
hat
and
abaya
robe
Instead
of
handing
out
candy
these
wing
nuts
have
Obama
handing
out
dollar
bills
which
he
stole
from
hard-working
conservative
millionaires
The
Right
Wing
doesn?t
say
much
about
Joe
Biden
knowing
he?s
sharper
than
any
of
the
candidates
about
foreign
affairs
but
he
does
occasionally
put
a
foot
in
his
mouth
Maybe
they
can
dress
him
as
a
podiatrist
The
Democrats
want
to
glue
John
McCain
to
George
W
Bush
and
parade
them
door-to-door
as
conjoined
twins
Assuming
that
isn?t
acceptable
to
McCain?at
least
now?maybe
the
Democrats
can
dress
McCain
as
a
Mission
Impossible
tape
recorder
knowing
at
some
point
he?ll
self-destruct
It
shouldn?t
be
too
hard
to
find
a
costume
for
Sarah
Palin
During
the
past
two
months
the
Republicans
spent
150,000
on
clothes
for
her
and
her
family
plus
at
least
23,000
for
makeup
After
figuring
out
that
the
nation
is
in
a
Recession
that
most
Americans
don?t
even
earn
170,000
in
three
years?and
that
some
outraged
Americans
found
out
about
her
shopping
spree?Palin
spun
out
and
claimed
that
the
clothes
really
aren?t
hers
and
will
be
donated
after
the
election
most
probably
to
starving
Republican
day
traders
For
Halloween
and
for
a
truly
scary
appearance
maybe
Mooseburger
could
remove
all
the
makeup
and
lipstick
her
handlers
put
on
her
to
make
salivating
middle-aged
men
believe
that
outward
beauty
is
an
acceptable
cover-up
to
inner
vacuousness
While
large
numbers
of
wolves
polar
bears
and
moose
have
been
seen
registering
to
vote
hoping
that
Palin
wins
and
leaves
their
state
Palin
is
busy
stalking
Dick
Cheney?s
footprint
hoping
to
continue
her
mind-meld
with
him
And
speaking
of
Cheney
a
nice
costume
for
him
might
be
a
repaired
heart
assuming
he
had
one
But
since
he
has
again
suddenly
disappeared
from
sight
he
might
be
dressed
as
the
Ghost
of
America
Thankfully
Past
Ralph
Nader
who
has
good
ideas
hardly
any
media
coverage
and
absolutely
no
chance
to
be
president
could
wear
a
large
fluorescent
green
leaf
and
carry
an
organic
sign??Hey
I?m
over
here
Bob
Barr
is
running
for
president
on
the
Libertarian
ticket
He
is
an
NRA
board
member
and
was
once
a
conservative
Republican
who
led
the
impeachment
of
Bill
Clinton
Lately
he?s
been
on
an
extended
speaking
tour
for
the
ACLU
Perhaps
we
could
dress
him
as
the
Statue
of
Liberty
a
rifle
in
one
hand
and
what?s
left
of
a
shredded
Constitution
fiercely
clutched
in
his
other
hand
There
are
more
than
200
other
third-party
and
independent
candidates
It
would
be
far
too
expensive
to
give
them
all
individual
costumes
so
why
not
dress
each
of
them
as
sheep
on
steroids
bleating
to
be
free
of
the
pack
and
hoping
to
attract
voters
who
are
disgusted
with
the
policies
and
candidates
of
the
Democratic
and
Republic
parties
We?re
not
scared
about
the
voters
They?ll
do
whatever
it
is
that
voters
do
for
whatever
reasons
they
do
it
We?re
scared
about
what
happens
to
their
votes
after
they?re
crunched
by
pro-Bush
Republican-dominated
Diebold
the
company
that
manufactures
most
electronic
voting
machines
in
the
country
Like
300
million
other
Americans
and
several
billion
in
other
countries
we?re
scared
about
the
economy
You
know
the
one
that
was
spurred
by
a
combination
of
greed
incompetence
and
lack
of
governmental
regulation
Children
and
their
parents
are
all
going
to
be
trick-or-treating
this
Halloween
hoping
there
are
still
some
families
that
have
extra
food
to
give
to
those
who
may
soon
become
homeless
Finally
we?re
really
scared
that
in
a
few
months
we?ll
all
hear
George
W
Bush
and
Dick
Cheney
tell
us
We?re

This
Made
Me
Cry
A
woman
in
the
day
care
I'll
call
her
Susan
but
that
isn't
her
real
name
had
had
an
emergency
Susan
is
the
oldest
woman
at
the
day
care
She
comes
in
early
in
the
morning
and
opens
the
day
care
sets
things
up
and
prepares
for
the
other
workers
to
arrive
Yesterday
after
the
other
workers
arrived
they
noticed
that
Susan
was
off
by
herself
and
she
was
crying
The
head
of
the
day
care
we'll
call
her
Jenny
approached
her
and
asked
what
was
wrong
The
staff
down
there
is
very
close
and
they
support
each
other
really
well
This
was
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
workers
shared
problems
and
pains
regularly
That
closeness
is
part
of
what
makes
the
day
care
great
But
this
wasn't
a
normal
situation
Susan
reported
that
she
hadn't
been
able
to
feel
half
of
her
face
all
morning
As
Jenny
listened
she
could
see
one
half
of
Susan's
face
contorting
on
its
own
Shocked
she
asked
why
Susan
hadn't
told
anyone
or
gone
to
the
hospital
Susan
said
she
didn't
want
anyone
to
know
because
she
didn't
have
insurance
and
didn't
think
she
could
afford
to
go
to
the
ER
But
after
some
urging
from
the
other
ladies
in
the
staff
who
could
also
see
the
noticeable
difference
in
Susan's
appearance
she
agreed
to
go
Jenny
drove
her
to
the
local
hospital
but
upon
arriving
was
unable
to
convince
Susan
to
go
in
Susan
began
crying
She
was
terrified
that
if
she
went
for
treatment
it
would
severely
damage
her
financially
Meanwhile
Jenny
was
crying
because
she
was
terrified
that
Susan
was
having
a
stroke
and
could
literally
die
right
there
in
her
car
in
the
hospital
parking
lot
I
was
stunned
by
the
story
I
can't
imagine
having
such
a
terrifying
medical
issue
going
on
and
having
to
chose
health
or
financial
security
The
thought
of
having
to
sit
there
in
the
moment
in
a
parking
lot
and
choose
to
throw
something
away
either
thousands
of
dollars
perhaps
even
a
house
car
or
any
number
of
other
possibilities
or
your
health
and
maybe
even
your
life
And
then
it
made
me
mad

time

Can
We
Save
The
World
Economy
A
Panel
Last
week
Columbia
University
hosted
a
panel
called
Can
We
Save
the
World
Economy
with
panel
members
George
Soros
Nouriel
Roubini
and
Jeffrey
Sachs
hosted
by
John
Roberts
of
CNN
The
session
was
incredibly
interesting
and
well
worth
the
time
to
watch
in
full
1
hour
45
minutes
if
one
has
the
time
Dr
Sachs
was
particularly
good
at
summarizing
why
our
economy
has
gotten
so
far
off
track
and
what
must
be
done
to
make
sure
we
are
prepared
to
address
the
challenges
ahead
He
blamed
the
education
given
to
economics
students
what
Atrios
called
Economics
101
which
he
said
has
been
divorced
from
verifying
what
they
expected
to
happen
with
what
was
really
happening
As
he
said
my
transcription
not
exact
quotes
The
way
we
train
people
to
think
in
mainstream
economics
and
I
would
say
in
mainstream
politics
have
made
it
almost
impossible
for
people
to
distinguish
the
surface
and
the
underlying
reality
Because
for
the
past
three-plus
decades
we
had
the
Age
of
Reagan
and
the
theory
of
Market
Fundamentalism
which
changed
the
way
we
taught
people
to
think
We
told
people
that
you
just
need
to
believe
that
the
prices
you
see
and
the
underlying
model
which
you
are
relying
on
are
close
because
the
Market
knows
how
to
value
prices
correctly
Sachs
says
that
economics
stopped
looking
for
cases
that
disproved
their
operating
model
and
began
to
assume
that
the
model
was
correct
and
if
things
got
out
of
hand
wow
housing
prices
are
REALLY
high
they
shape
their
expectations
to
conform
to
their
belief
Prices
always
go
up
In
other
words
our
schools
were
training
students
to
eschew
the
scientific
mode
of
thinking
But
Dr
Sachs
noted
you
can
only
ignore
reality
for
so
long
Eventually
reality
has
the
last
word
on
the
subject
And
he
noted
What
fundamental
proper
skepticism
shows
the
type
of
skepticism
that
George
Soros
was
taught
and
also
what
the
logic
of
economic
bubbles
shows
and
what
the
logic
of
biophysical
bubbles
shows
is
what
you
see
on
the
surface
can
completely
hide
and
obscure
what
is
happening
below
And
it
is
our
job
as
scientists
and
I
would
say
our
job
as
responsible
citizens
to
understand
the
deep
points
and
therefore
to
help
rectify
the
discrepancies
between
what
we
see
on
the
surface
and
what
is
really
happening
and
keep
us
out
of
trouble
My
rough
notes
for
this
session
can
be
found
below
the
fold

America?s
Buddy-Buddy
Campaign
Press
Corps
by
Walter
Brasch
It?s
a
little
more
than
a
week
before
the
presidential
election
and
I?m
worried
about
what
happens
afterwards
I?m
not
worried
about
the
candidates
the
people
or
the
country
I?m
worried
about
the
media
First
I?m
worried
about
the
TV
ad
salespeople
For
more
than
a
year
they
haven?t
had
to
do
much
other
than
sit
back
and
open
digital
files
from
the
politicians
Now
the
salespeople
will
actually
have
to
go
to
work
to
fill
airtime
I?m
worried
about
the
owners
of
TV
stations
Since
January
politicians
have
placed
more
than
a
billion
dollars
of
advertising
Most
of
that
has
gone
to
TV
ads
at
least
in
Pennsylvania
and
the
other
swing
states
Revenue
is
bound
to
be
down
and
the
station
owners
may
have
to
make
drastic
changes
We
can?t
expect
them
to
cut
back
on
their
golf
club
memberships
the
leased
BMWs
or
the
daily
maid
service
It
looks
like
they?ll
have
to
lay
off
reporters
Some
may
think
that
the
words
TV
and
reporter
probably
don?t
even
make
sense
in
the
same
sentence
but
that?s
for
another
column
And
speaking
of
reporters
let?s
look
at
all
the
reporters
Print
and
Broadcast
For
as
much
as
two
years
they
have
been
hanging
onto
political
candidates
like
leeches
onto
the
butts
of
subtropical
hunters
These
reporters
have
had
to
stay
in
sleazy
3
and
4-star
hotels
eat
room
service
food
awaken
early
every
day
pack
their
suitcases
and
rush
to
a
Press
bus
that
would
be
their
traveling
home
for
12
or
14
hours
every
day
On
the
bus
they
talked
with
each
other?and
some
poorly-paid
and
generally
inexperienced
campaign
press
aide
Occasionally
the
candidates
and
senior
staff
rode
the
buses
and
talked
with
the
reporters
At
the
speech
site
the
reporters
were
herded
into
a
fairly
good
viewing
position
and
expected
to
do
whatever
it
is
that
compliant
reporters
do
If
they
interviewed
anyone
other
than
campaign
staff
it
was
usually
someone
in
the
audience
grabbing
such
great
lines
as
I
really
like
Shmidhouse
Jones
for
President
or
I
don?t
trust
that
guy
he?s
running
against
Away
from
speeches
they
munched
on
campaign-provided
lunches
and
drinks
campaign-provided
news
releases
and
speech
transcripts
and
campaign-provided
concierge
service
If
case
they
missed
an
important
ad-lib
they
just
had
to
wait
for
the
next
stop
where
they?d
hear
it
again
Late
at
night
if
they
have
any
energy
left?and
while
they
have
plugged
in
their
Blackberries
iPods
cell
phones
and
laptops
to
draw
new
energy
for
a
new
day?the
reporters
and
campaign
staff
had
a
couple
of
drinks
just
to
unwind
The
goal
of
political
campaigns
is
to
keep
reporters
so
busy
and
so
comforted
they
won?t
ask
the
critical
questions
or
take
the
time
to
find
the
Invisible
People
and
their
very
real
problems
For
a
month
after
the
election
reporters
will
file
What
happened
stories
After
a
month
they?ll
get
home
leave
to
be
reintroduced
to
their
children
who
may
have
thought
Mommy
or
Daddy
were
sprites
locked
up
in
cell
phones
Hopefully
the
reporters
will
also
reflect
upon
why
they
became
reporters
and
actually
take
the
time
to
meet
someone
who
doesn?t
hang
around
politicians
and
reporters
all
day
long
Walter
Brasch?s
latest
book
is
the
second
edition
of
Sinking
the
Ship
of
State
The
Presidency
of
George
W
Bush

2007
available

Dr
Brasch
has
covered
several
Presidential
campaigns
usually
away
from
the
press
gaggle

This
is
a

great
ad

I
agree
with
her
professor's
assessment
I'd
be
thrilled
to
have
someone
of
Darcy's

representing

We

need

Voting
Smart
If
like
me
you
are
starting
to
look
at
your
ballot
beyond
the
all
important
Presidential
and
national
elections
you
might
be
wondering
how
do
you
decide
which
of
those
innumerable
lower
candidates
to
vote
for
in
the
election
for
your
Community
College
district
or
for
your
Superior
Court
Judge
And
if
you
live
in
a
state
like
California
you
have
to
wade
through
the
number
of
propositions
that
flood
the
ballot
every
election
So
where
do
you
go
for
good
information
Here's
some
of
the
ways
I
make
sense
of
this
important
act
of
citizenship
If
you
are
still
undecided
on
the
national
front
get
thee
to
Project
Vote
Smart
who
can
tell
you
who
backs
the
candidates
in
your
states
who
funds
them
who
endorses
them
and
generally
provide
you
a
wealth
of
information
about
your
candidates
and
what
you
might
expect
if
they
get
elected
This
is
an
organization
that
was
started
a
number
of
years
ago
as
a
bi-partisan
voter
resource
center
that
is
finally
coming
in
to
its
own
If
you
have
friends
and
family
who
wonder
who
they
should
believe
point
them
to
Project
Vote
Smart
because
they
are
truly
independent
and
dedicated
to
making
sure
you
the
voter
get
the
information
you
need
to
make
good
decisions
If
you
live
in
states
where
the
League
of
Women
Voters
are
active
such
as
California
you
can
get
slew
of
information
about
the
local
elections
from
their
website
Smart
Voter
Entering
in
my
zip
code
and
address
I'm
able
to
get
the
full
ballot
for
my
city
and
all
the
candidates
running
for
office
here
And
I
can
see
the
candidate
statements
and
answers
to
some
basic
questions
about
how
they
see
their
role
in
the
office
for
which
they
are
running
and
how
they
see
the
challenges
for
this
role
For
example
the
candidates
running
for
my
local
Community
College
District
were
asked
to
respond
to
the
following
three
questions
What
experience
and
training
would
you
bring
to
this
office
What
do
you
see
as
the
role
of
the
Board
in
labor
negotiations
What
are
your
goals
for
the
college
Are
students
faculty
and
staff
currently
meeting
those
goals
As
you
can
see
you
can
get
quite
a
bit
of
information
about
a
candidate
from
this
website
Nevertheless
it
is
not
enough
to
look
only
at
what
a
candidate
says
about
their
goals
because
sometimes
candidates
lie
As
voters
we
have
to
be
careful
not
to
elect
stealth
candidates
who
promise
to
improve
local
schools
but
who
have
an
agenda
to
promote
anti-science
or
anti-health
aka
anti-sexual
information
agendas
If
an
agenda
is
truly
worthy
of
being
voted
upon
it
ought
to
be
based
on
honest
and
upfront
statements
of
what
truly
is
their
agenda
and
let
the
voters
decide
if
that
is
something
they
too
support
Knowing
who
supports
and
funds
a
candidate
can
help
you
make
more
informed
decisions
The
Smart
Voter
site
helps
here
by
providing
additional
information
about
who
endorsed
the
candidates
and
backs
the
candidates
The
other
place
I
look
to
for
advice
on
on
voting
is
organizations
that
support
the
same
goals
I
support
So
I
look
seriously
at
the
recommendations
of
the
Sierra
Club
for
their
analysis
of
the
propositions
When
the
Sierra
Club
came
out
against
two
of
the
big
propositions
on
this
year's
ballot
that
dealt
with
clean
energy
I
listened
carefully
to
their
arguments
They
are
urging
their
members
to
vote
no
on
both
Proposition
7
Solar
and
Clean
Energy
Act
of
2008
and
Proposition
10
Alternative
Fuel
Vehicles
and
Renewable
Energy
Bonds
Why
Because
neither
proposition
addresses
the
current
challenges
adequately
and
both
would
lock
their
flaws
into
solutions
going
forward
We
can
do
better
As
Americans
we
are
especially
fortunate
to
live
in
the
age
of
Google
We
get
innundated
with
campaign
fliers
and
campaign
ads
Although
you
need
to
be
careful
about
the
quality
of
information
on
the
web
it
is
much
easier
to
investigate
your
candidates
and
the
ballot
propositions
before
going
to
vote
Make
sure
you
do
your
homework
before
going
to
the
polls
And
final
words
please
please
vote
We've
been
hearing
it
for
a
long
time
but
this
truly
is
the
most
important
election
in
our
lifetimes
Use
the
resources
available
to
help
inform
your
decisions
but
do
make
sure
you
vote
Vote
like
your
life
depended
on
it

Going
Negative
Is
Not
a
Positive
Way
to
Get
Votes
by
Walter
Brasch
During
the
final
debate
last
week
Barack
Obama
called
John
McCain
on
the
negative
ads
saying
that
100
percent
of
his
radio
and
TV
ads
were
negative
Not
true
replied
McCain
True
according
to
the
Advertising
Project
at
the
University
of
Wisconsin
Almost
every
ad
in
a
one-week
period
before
the
debate
was
negative
The
nonpartisan
analysts
determined
that
between
June
4
and
October
4
47
percent
of
the
McCain
spots
were
negative
completely
focused
on
Obama
26
percent
were
positive
completely
focusing
on
his
own
personal
story
or
on
his
issues
or
proposals
and
27
percent
were
contrast
ads
a
mix
of
positive
and
negative
messages
The
Project
also
noted
that
only
about
35
percent
of
Obama?s
ads
are
negative
about
39
percent
are
positive
and
about
25
percent
are
contrast
ads
However
McCain?s
campaign
also
rightly
points
out
that
Obama
has
spent
far
more
on
negative
ads
than
has
McCain
That?s
because
Obama
has
bought
far
more
TV
ad
time
than
McCain
The
Campaign
Media
Analysis
Group
an
independent
research
company
reports
Obama
during
the
final
weeks
of
the
campaign
is
outspending
McCain
by
four
to
one
By
the
election
Obama
will
have
spent
more
than
200
million
in
the
three
months
after
the
Democratic
convention
An
Ipsos
public
affairs
poll
released
a
few
days
after
the
final
debate
reveals
that
57
percent
of
voters
said
the
negative
ads
aren?t
effective
Unless
a
candidate
has
a
strong
positive
message
outlining
what
he
or
she
believes
and
is
willing
to
push
if
elected
negative
ads
may
also
have
a
backlash
effect
as
voters
see
only
the
dirt
being
thrown
Sens
Norman
Coleman
R-Minn
and
Susan
Collins
R-Maine
are
among
leading
Republicans
who
have
attacked
the
McCain
attack
ads
They
don?t
serve
John
McCain
well
said
Collins
co-chair
of
McCain?s
Maine
campaign
She
said
the
ads
especially
an
automated
telephone
robocall
that
ties
Obama
to
radicals
does
not
reflect
the
kind
of
leader
that
he
McCain
is
McCain?s
negative
ad
campaign
was
also
one
of
the
reasons
why
Colin
Powell?chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
under
George
H.W
Bush
secretary
of
state
under
George
W
Bush?crossed
party
lines
three
weeks
before
the
election
to
endorse
Obama
Another
negative
arises
with
the
use
of
negative
ads
With
voters
being
bombarded
with
radio
TV
Internet
and
direct
mail
ads
the
effect
isn?t
so
much
an
additive
effect?the
more
ads
the
better
the
possibility
of
retention?but
a
subtractive
effect?voters
aren?t
even
paying
attention
If
they
do
it?s
solely
to
names
with
name
recognition
often
overriding
political
issues
Thus
if
a
negative
TV
ad
mentions
an
opponent
twice
as
many
times
the
voter
comprehends
the
name
not
the
message
the
brain
may
be
subconsciously
processing
names
as
it
does
when
confronted
by
thousands
of
lawn
signs
and
billboards
with
the
most
mentions
leading
to
a
vote
Whatever
else
the
McCain
campaign
does
in
the
next
three
weeks
there
is
one
reality?the
overwhelming
placement
of
negative
ads
on
TV
reveals
a
campaign
that
not
only
is
desperate
for
votes
but
also
sliding
even
further
from
election
