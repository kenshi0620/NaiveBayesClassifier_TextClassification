Cincy
Enquirer
Runs
Correction
listed
in
Economy
On
Sunday
LiberalOasis
called
out
the
Cincinnati
Enquirer
for
using
a
phony
Obama
quote
from
a
viral
right-wing
email
in
its
endorsement
of
McCan
It
was
picked
up
by
Ohio
blogs
Buckeye
State
Blog
The
Cincinnati
Beacon
and
Writes
Like
She
Talks
The
Beacon
directly
contacted
the
Enquirer
and
called
for
a
correction
Today
the
Beacon
reports
we
got
one
It
reads
in
part
In
putting
together
Sundayâ??s
endorsement
we
failed
to
double
check
with
the
original
Wall
Street
Journal
article
to
verify
the
quote
If
we
had
we
would
have
attributed
those
words
directly
to
the
newspaper
not
to
the
candidate
It
was
an
unintentional
but
substantial
error
that
we
regret
We
take
all
such
errors
very
seriously
and
strive
for
accuracy
of
information
in
opinion
pieces
as
well
as
news
articles
This
incident
illustrates
but
does
not
excuse
us
from
one
of
the
perils
of
the
online
information
age
Statements
and
facts
can
easily
be
lifted
out
of
context
altered
repeated
and
circulated
virally
throughout
the
Web
to
the
point
where
inaccurate
information
can
sometimes
become
accepted
as
true
One
of
the
valuable
tools
for
ferreting
out
such
inaccuracies
is
the
Snopes
site
www.snopes.com
which
does
have
an
entry
devoted
to
the
quote
in
question
The
Beacon's
response
is
spot-on
While
the
paper
does
not
give
the
following
as
an
excuse
I
am
concerned
that
they
would
quote
a
viral
email
in
a
major
endorsement
So
kudos
to
The
Enquirer
for
correcting
their
error
but
what
an
error
to
have
made
in
the
first
place

Barbara
West
should
be
fired
listed
in
Media
There
are
some
things
that
really
have
been
repulsive
in
this
election
season
Over
the
weekend
Joe
Biden
did
an
interview
with
a
Florida
television
station
The
questions
were
simply
the
worst
Republican
talking
points
ever
KFTV
needs
to
apologize
and
fire
Barbara
West
There
is
a
difference
between
a
political
operative
and
a
news
reporter
From
FireDogLake
It's
a
tale
of
two
interview
subjects
and
one
GOP-agenda-driven
journalist
And
what
a
tale
it
is
JedReport
took
a
peek
at
KFTV's
Barbara
West
and
interviews
with
Joe
Biden
and
John
McCain
The
side
by
side
comparison
is
astonishing
Watch
the
clip
and
you'll
see
exactly
what
I
mean
bias
alla
way
baby
Matt
Stoller's
done
a
series
of
posts
recently
about
issues
of
bias
in
local
media
and
repeated
use
of
hand-fed
GOP
talking
points
as
research
which
is
worth
watching
closely
With
the
advent
of
media
consolidation
more
and
more
local
stations
are
in
the
hands
of
fewer
and
fewer
large
corporate
conglomerates
and
that's
not
good
for
fact-checking
or
diversity
of
opinion
BT
asked
this
morning
that
folks
sign
a
petition
demanding
an
apology
from
WFTV
for
this
hatchet
job
posing
as
an
interview
I'm
asking
for
your
help
on
this
as
well
You

Cincy
Enquirer
McCain
Endorsement
Based
on
Phony
Obama
Quote
listed
in
Economy
The
Cincinnati
Enquirer
endorsement
of
Sen
John
McCain
includes
this
paragraph
emphasis
added
The
recent
dialogue
between
Obama
and
Joe
the
Plumber
Ohio
resident
Joe
Wurzelbacher
illustrated
to
voters
Obama's
focus
on
spreading
the
wealth
through
taxes
rather
than
growing
the
nation's
wealth
by
encouraging
middle-class
Americans
to
aspire
upward
creating
more
businesses
jobs
income
and
more
tax
revenue
A
strong
government
hand
is
needed
to
assure
that
wealth
is
distributed
more
equitably
Obama
says
That's
a
zero-sum
central-control
mentality
One
problem
Obama
never
said
that
As
reported
by
snopes.com
a
viral
email
has
spread
which
takes
a
misleading
and
overly
simplistic
paraphrase
of
Obama's
words
by
the
Wall
Street
Journal
and
falsely
attributes
it
to
Obama
Here
is
a
partial
transcript
of
the
June
interview
on
which
the
WSJ
article
was
based
emphasis
added
WSJ
I
wanted
to
talk
about
long-term
economic
growth
sort
of
following
on
your
speech
I
noticed
that
in
an
interesting
way
you
use
Lincoln
FDR
and
JFK
heroes
in
many
ways
Maybe
you
can
talk
to
me
a
little
bit
about
your
view
of
the
government's
role
in
economic
growth
Sen
Obama
This
dates
back
even
further
to
Alexander
Hamilton
The
strength
of
our
economy
has
always
been
the
dynamism
of
the
private
sector
but
at
critical
junctures
particularly
when
we're
at
a
transformative
time
say
the
shift
from
agricultural
era
to
the
industrial
era
where
you've
got
some
broad-based
investment
that
needs
to
be
made
they're
very
expensive
They're
difficult
for
any
private
investor
to
want
to
make
on
their
own
I
think
Lincoln's
Homestead
Act
or
the
land-grant
college
system
was
a
great
example
of
opening
up
the
West
It's
still
the
American
people
and
business
taking
advantage
of
these
opportunities
but
you
needed
the
government
to
help
get
them
started
Obviously
infrastructure
is
a
classic
example
of
these
types
of
investments
whether
it
is
the
interstate
highway
system
or
the
Internet
I
think
education
is
another
example
whether
it's
the
creation
of
public
schools
or
the
GI
Bill
after
World
War
II
I
think
now
we
need
to
be
thinking
about
similar
investments
in
critical
areas
like
the
ones
I
listed
today
WSJ
Why
do
you
think
at
this
particular
juncture
we
need
it
now
Sen
Obama
Partly
because
we're
going
through
a
big
shift
from
a
national
economy
that
was
also
dominant
across
the
globe
to
a
truly
global
economy
in
which
we're
seeing
competition
from
every
corner
We've
seen
an
additional
three
billion
people
added
to
capitalism
partly
because
of
the
success
of
the
U.S
creating
a
working
liberal
economic
order
but
also
because
of
technology
and
the
rapidity
with
which
technology
is
moving
You
look
at
a
place
like
Flint
Michigan
where
the
old
industrial
structures
have
been
completely
uprooted
and
we've
got
to
help
the
residents
here
transition
to
this
new
economy
and
we've
got
to
make
sure
that
we
are
putting
in
place
the
kinds
of
structures
that
will
allow
us
to
compete
long
term
WSJ
Some
people
would
say
with
this
kind
of
change
that
you'd
need
the
opposite
less
government
because
in
a
globalized
world
markets
are
so
much
more
important
You
seem
to
say
that
at
a
point
when
the
global
economy
is
getting
so
important
you'd
redouble
Sen
Obama
I
wouldn't
say
redouble
Revitalized
I
would
say
Because
I
think
the
danger
is
always
to
equate
size
of
government
with
effectiveness
and
I
don't
It's
not
clear
to
me
that
we
want
a
larger
government
but
we
certainly
want
a
government
that
is
setting
more
intelligent
priorities
and
using
taxpayer
dollars
more
wisely
and
structuring
tax
policies
that
are
conducive
to
long-term
economic
growth
As
I
mentioned
during
the
speech
there
may
be
programs
that
no
longer
work
There's
certainly
all
kinds
of
previsions
in
our
tax
code
that
are
antiquated
and
are
not
spurring
economic
growth
We've
got
offices
like
the
patent
office
that
are
outdated
to
take
advantage
of
new
discoveries
here
in
the
United
States
We
need
to
retool
our
government
so
that
it
works
with
a
21st
century
economy
and
in
some
ways
our
campaign
has
shown
what
happens
when
you
retool
political
campaigns
to
a
new
requirement
I
think
we
need
to
do
the
same
thing
with
government
as
well
WSJ
What
about
the
role
of
taxation
For
the
most
part
the
way
I
look
at
your
tax
policy
seems
to
me
that
you
look
at
it
and
say
tax
policy
over
the
past
decade
and
maybe
even
before
that
has
produced
an
outcome
that
has
benefited
people
mostly
at
the
top
and
your
goal
is
to
try
to
redistribute
it
in
a
different
fashion
Sen
Obama
Here's
what
I
would
say
I
do
believe
the
tax
policies
over
the
last
eight
years
have
been
badly
skewed
towards
the
winners
of
the
global
economy
And
I
do
think
there
is
a
function
for
tax
policy
in
making
sure
that
everybody
benefits
from
globalization
or
at
least
the
benefits
and
burdens
are
shared
a
little
more
easily
If
as
some
talk
about
we've
got
a
winner-take-all
economy
where
the
highly
skilled
highly
educated
are
reaping
huge
rewards
and
the
unskilled
or
even
semi-skilled
are
getting
a
much
smaller
share
of
the
economy
then
our
tax
policies
can
help
cushion
some
of
the
blow
through
providing
health
care
So
if
people
lose
their
jobs
they're
not
losing
their
health
care
as
well
That
actually
makes
a
more
flexible
work
force
that
makes
workers
more
mobile
and
less
resistant
to
change
If
we've
got
investments
in
education
that
will
make
us
more
competitive
in
the
long
run
We've
got
to
pay
for
that
like
anything
else
But
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
say
I
view
our
tax
code
only
as
a
distribution
question
I
also
think
that
our
tax
code
has
come
to
distort
a
lot
of
economic
decision
making
so
I'd
like
to
see
simplification
as
part
of
an
overall
tax
agenda
On
the
corporate
side
for
example
one
of
the
things
I've
asked
my
folks
to
look
at
is
Are
there
ways
we
can
close
existing
loopholes
in
tax
havens
at
the
same
time
as
we're
lowering
overall
rates
We've
got
this
new
problem
The
biggest
problem
with
our
tax
code
when
it
comes
to
the
business
side
is
that
we
have
one
of
the
highest
tax
rates
corporate
tax
rates
on
paper
but
our
effective
tax
rate
is
one
of
the
lowest
You
know
how
much
you
pay
in
taxes
as
a
corporation
a
lot
of
times
is
going
to
depend
on
how
good
your
lobbyist
is
as
opposed
to
any
sound
economic
theories
So
those
distorting
effects
I'd
like
to
actually
remove
and
eliminate
from
our
tax
system
but
obviously
that's
a
complicated
and
difficult
task
The
last
time
we
did
it
was
in
1986
We're
going
to
have
to
I
think
revisit
that
WSJ
Would
you
like
to
reduce
the
corporate
tax
rate
Sen
Obama
If
we
could
eliminate
loopholes
in
taxes
create
a
level
playing
field
then
I
think
there's
the
possibility
to
reducing
corporate
rates
WSJ
Have
you
proposed
reducing
corporate
rates
Sen
Obama
We're
still
working
with
our
team
to
take
a
look
at
that
WSJ
When
you
were
talking
about
no
taxation
of
startups
what
immediately
went
through
my
mind
is
well
every
corporation
in
American
is
going
to
have
a
startup
so
they
won't
pay
capital
gains
Sen
Obama
There
are
always
folks
who
are
interested
in
gaming
the
system
and
obviously
one
of
the
things
you
have
to
do
with
tax
policy
generally
is
to
pin
down
definitions
so
they're
not
twisted
beyond
recognition
But
I
think
the
basic
concept
which
is
companies
that
are
starting
off
that
have
a
good
idea
that
don't
have
a
lot
of
capital
they
should
be
allowed
to
accumulate
capital
reinvest
profits
if
there
are
any
to
the
point
that
they
stabilize
that's
something
we
should
encourage
WSJ
You
talked
about
the
last
eight
years
and
the
question
of
redistribution
goes
way
back
Sen
Obama
Oh
there's
no
doubt
about
it
That's
why
I
say
that
the
combination
of
globalization
and
technology
and
automation
all
weaken
the
position
of
workers
I
would
add
an
anti-union
climate
to
that
list
But
all
weakens
the
position
of
workers
particularly
blue-collar
workers
in
the
economy
and
some
of
it
is
just
historical
You
know
after
World
War
II
we
were
in
this
unique
position
where
Europe
was
decimated
Japan
was
decimated
China
was
off
the
grid
because
of
Mao
And
so
we
didn't
have
a
lot
of
competition
out
there
and
now
other
countries
are
rising
and
automation
has
supplanted
a
lot
of
work
that
used
to
be
done
by
middle-class
workers
We
have
drastically
increased
productivity
since
1995
and
there
was
the
theory
that
if
you
increase
productivity
enough
some
of
these
problems
of
living
standards
would
solve
themselves
But
what
we've
seen
is
rising
productivity
rising
corporate
profits
but
flat-lining
or
even
declining
wages
and
incomes
for
the
average
family
What
that
says
is
that
it's
going
to
be
important
for
us
to
pay
attention
to
not
only
growing
the
pie
which
is
always
critical
but
also
some
attention
to
how
it
is
sliced
I
do
not
believe
that
those
two
things
fair
distribution
and
robust
economic
growth
are
mutually
exclusive
You
get
to
a
point
I
think
if
you
have
a
participatory
income
tax
for
example
where
you
might
be
discouraging
work
because
marginal
rates
are
so
high
You
might
undoubtedly
get
to
a
point
where
the
capital
gain
and
dividend
taxes
are
so
high
that
they
distort
investment
decisions
and
you're
weaker
economically
But
you
know
if
you've
got
a
sensible
policy
that
says
we're
going
to
capture
some
of
the
nation's
economic
growth
and
reinvest
it
in
things
we
know
have
to
be
done
like
science
and
technology
research
or
fixing
our
energy
policy
and
then
that
is
actually
going
to
be
a
spur
to
productivity
and
not
an
inhibitor
As
you
can
see
from
the
full
context
there
is
no
zero-sum
central-command
mentality
There
is
a
mentality
that
a
tax
code
which
redistributes
wealth
upwards
shortchanges
the
middle-class
and
starves
public
investments
is
harmful
to
the
goal
of
broad-based
economic
growth
the
opposite
of
zero-sum
There
is
also
a
recognition
that
exorbitantly
high
taxes
are
harmful
to
economic
growth
and
certain
business
taxes
should
be
cut
so
long
as
we're
closing
harmful
corporate
tax
loopholes
at
the
same
time
The
overall
vision
is
one
of
effective
government
complementing
the
capitalist
economy
investing
in
critical
areas
that
have
been
neglected
by
markets
but
certainly
not
attempting
to
centrally
control
markets
which
the
made-up
quote
strong
government
hand
implies
No
question
Obama
supports
more
robust
government
involvement
than
McCain
and
President
Bush
As
you
can
see
above
Obama
has
been
quite
explicit
about
it
and
is
helping
offer
a
clear
contrast
for
voters
to
choose
between
But
those
conservatives
who
remain
addicted
to
misinformation
are
unwilling
to
engage
in
a
fact-based
debate
Apparently
they
include
the
Cincinnati
Enquirer
editorial
board
which
apparently
instead
of
reporting
gets
its
mis)information
from
right-wing
viral
emails

McCain
listed
in
Elections
The
McCain
campaign
tells
the
New
York
Times
today
how
it
sees
a
path
to
270
electoral
college
votes
After
talking
about
holding
on
the
bulk
of
Bush
04
states
that
equal
260
votes
Mr
McCainâ??s
advisers
said
they
would
look
for
the
additional
electoral
votes
they
need
either
by
taking
Pennsylvania
from
the
Democrats
or
putting
together
some
combination
of
Colorado
Nevada
New
Hampshire
and
New
Mexico
Well
take
New
Mexico
off
of
that
list
since
another
McCain
official
told
Politico
yesterday
We
have
lost
Iowa
and
New
Mexico
Oddly
McCain
and
Palin
will
be
in
Iowa
and
New
Mexico
in
the
next
couple
of
days
Their
scheduling
has
been
befuddling
Republican
consultants
outside
of
the
campaign
for
some
time
Without
PA
McCain
would
need
at
least
Colorado's
9
electoral
votes
to
have
a
shot
at
270
Nevada
and
New
Hampshire
together
would
fall
one
vote
short
But
McCain
is
trying
to
win
Colorado
on
the
cheap
Republicans
are
scaling
back
advertising
there
though
it's
not
a
total
abandonment
A
local
political
science
professor
observed
As
McCain
continues
to
spend
money
in
Colorado
he'll
spend
it
in
the
strong
Republican
counties
and
leave
Denver
alone
So
that's
one
longshot
bet
The
other
is
Pennsylvania
where
two
more
polls
came
out
yesterday
showing
Obama
with
double-digit
leads
Obviously
the
hope
is
that
social
issues
and
racial
factors
can
trump
the
economy
But
that
was
a
winning
game
plan
McCain
would
have
been
more
competitive
in
the
similar
state
of
Michigan
Yet
the
campaign
pulled
the
plug
on
Michigan
weeks
ago
which
was
the
first
sign
McCain
needed
a
stronger
positive
economic
message
if
he
was
going
to
have
a
chance
And
that
remains
McCain's
fundamental
problem
He
seems
to
have
finally
recognized
that
insinuating
Obama
is
a
terrorist
sympathizer
wasn't
going
to
take
people's
minds
off
of
the
economy
though
robo-calls
still
push
the
smears
under
the
radar
But
read
McCain's
Wed
speech
from
New
Hampshire
It's
about
the
economy
but
how
many
paragraphs
are
dedicated
to
what
McCain
himself
would
do
about
the
economy
One
And
that's
just
a
short
summation
of
his
tax
cuts
nothing
remotely
close
to
a
comprehensive
economic
vision
and
plan
The
rest
of
the
speech
consists
of
attacks
on
Obama
with
over-the-top
false
claims
largely
about
taxes
These
attacks
are
being
rejected
by
the
public
as
Obama
holds
a
14-point
lead
on
the
issue
of
taxes
Sure
when
you're
down
you
need
to
take
the
front-runner
down
a
peg
But
it
needs
to
be
done
with
Straight
Talk
and
it
needs
to
be
coupled
with
a
compelling
message
about
what
you
would
do
differently
than
Bush
and
Obama
After
McCain's
wobbly
performance
in
the
midst
of
economic
crisis
strictly
attacking
Obama
just
won't
do
He
needs
to
build
trust
in
his
economic
abilities
with
very
little
time
left
That
remains
his
biggest
and
likely
fatal
problem

Obama
to
take
time
away
from
campaign
to
visit
ailing
Grandmother
listed
in
Elections
It
has
been
reported
that
Barack
Obama's
grandmother
is
gravely
ill
Obama
will
fly
to
Hawaii
on
Thursday
to
be
with
his
grandmother
and
will
rejoin
the
campaign
on
Saturday
I
thought
that
lately
we
had
heard
that
we
Dems
and
therefore
Obama
were
un-American
Going
home
to
see
an
ill
grandmother
is
VERY
American
Representative
Robin
Hayes
Republican
North
Carolina
has
said
that
liberals
hate
real
Americans
that
work
and
achieve
and
believe
in
God
He
has
since
tried
to
deny
that
he
ever
said
that
Michelle
Bachmann
R-Mn
has
been
one
of
my
favor
Republicans
because
she
doesn't
filter
what
she
believes
She
just
throws
it
out
there
By
now
everyone
has
seen
her
Joe
McCarthy
type
of
attack
on
Barack
Obama
and
other
Dems
on
Hardball
with
Chris
Matthews
Her
attack
has
clearly
backfired
The
GOP
is
pulling
support
from
her
district
The
good
news
is
that
Larry
Kissell
is
a
great
Democrat
who
barely
lost
to
Robin
Hayes
two
years
ago
Larry
needs
our
support
I
contributed
financially
two
years
ago
and
have
again
this
year
From
MSNBC
Democrat
presidential
candidate
Barack
Obama
is
canceling
nearly
all
his
campaign
events
Thursday
and
Friday
to
fly
to
Hawaii
to
visit
his
suddenly
ill
85-year-old
grandmother
his
spokesman
said
Robert
Gibbs
told
reporters
Monday
that
Obama's
grandmother
Madelyn
Payne
Dunham
who
helped
raise
him
was
released
from
the
hospital
late
last
week
But
he
said
her
health
had
deteriorated
to
the
point
where
her
situation
is
very
serious
Obama
was
expected
to
resume
campaigning
on
Saturday
though
Gibbs
was
unsure
where
