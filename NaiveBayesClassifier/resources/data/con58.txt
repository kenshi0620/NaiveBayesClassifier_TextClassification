Dirty
Tricks
in
Mississippi
As
I've
written
here
before
the
most
important
election
next
week
in
Mississippi
may
be
the
race
for
state's
Supreme
Court
justice
from
the
Gulf
Coast
area
Mississippi
Supreme
Court
justices
are
elected
to
8-year
terms
The
incumbent
Oliver
Diaz
Jr
is
the
only
justice
on
the
state's
highest
court
who
has
gone
on
record
stating
that
former
Mississippi
medical
examiner
Dr
Steven
Hayne
ought
to
be
barred
from
testifying
in
the
state's
courts
He's
also
one
of
maybe
just
two
justices
on
the
court
who
seem
to
recognize
that
there
are
some
fundamental
problems
with
Mississippi's
criminal
justice
system
Two
weeks
ago
a
Springfield
Virginia
organization
called
the
Law
Enforcement
Alliance
of
America
began
running
a
scurrilous
false
attack
ad
saying
Diaz
voted
for
two
baby
killers
and
a
man
executed
for
beating
a
woman
to
death
Diaz
wasn't
even
on
the
court
when
one
of
those
cases
was
decided
In
another
he
eventually
voted
to
uphold
the
conviction
and
death
sentence
of
an
accused
murderer
he
merely
voted
to
delay
the
execution
until
the
U.S
Supreme
Court
issued
its
own
opinion
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
lethal
injection
The
third
case
LEAA
mentions
in
its
ad
is
most
aggravating
It's
the
case
of
Jeffrey
Havard
which
I've
written
about
here
on
several
occasions
Havard
was
convicted
of
killing
his
girlfriend's
daughter
based
almost
entirely
on
the
testimony
of
discredited
medical
examiner
Dr
Steven
Hayne
Other
far
more
reputable
forensic
pathologists
have
since
cast
serious
doubt
on
Hayne's
testimony
in
that
case
Diaz
should
be
commended
for
his
votes
in
Havard's
appeal
Because
Havard
deserves
a
new
trial
In
a
state
where
there
have
been
four
exonerations
in
the
last
18
months
including
two
men
wrongly
convicted
of
being
baby
killers
and
where
mounting
troubling
questions
about
the
state's
death
investigation
system
suggest
there
are
likely
to
be
many
more
LEAA's
attack
on
Diaz
is
disgraceful
in
addition
to
being
out-and-out
false
Comcast
agreed
to
stop
running
the
ad
after
Mississippi's
Special
Committee
on
Judicial
Election
Campaign
Intervention
found
that
it
violates
the
Code
of
Judicial
Conduct
But
the
damage
may
already
be
done
The
ads
have
been
running
for
two
weeks

Medical
Marijuana
The
Debate
Next
week
Michigan
voters
will
determine
whether
or
not
to
legalize
medical
marijuana
Bruce
Mirken
sends
the
following
two
videos
which
I
think
pretty
accurately
sum
up
the
debate
Incidentally
federal
officials
are
mostly
prohibited
from
intervening
in
local
elections
this
way
Congress
granted
a
special
exemption
allowing
federal
drug
warriors
to
spend
federal
tax
dollars
to
campaign
against
drug
liberalization
ballot
measures
in
the

Bush
and
Regulation
So
I
just
finished
editing
a
piece
by
Veronique
de
Rugy
for
an
upcoming
issue
of
reason
There's
little
debate
that
President
Bush
has
spent
wildly
over
the
last
eight
years
or
that
he
has
vastly
expanded
the
size
and
scope
of
the
federal
government
But
thus
far
Obama
and
the
Democrats
have
been
unchallenged
in
their
portrayal
of
Bush
and
the
GOP
as
reluctant
regulators
even
as
deregulators
I
don't
want
to
give
up
too
much
about
de
Rugy's
piece
but
I'll
just
say
she
convincingly
and
thoroughly
refutes
that
claim
Bush
set
regulators
loose
like
no
president
since
Roosevelt
Spending
on
regulatory
agencies
is
at
all-time
highs
across
the
board
including
at
the
agencies
that
regulate
banking
and
capital
markets
Bush's
administration
failed
at
many
things
But
de
Rugy's
piece
which
will
appear
in
our
January
issue
shows
it
wasn't
because
he
was
ever
shy
about
regulation

The
reason
Ballot
Over
at
my
place
of
employment
we
polled
the
reason
universe
about
the
election
and
a
few
other
questions
My
answers
1
Who
are
you
voting
for
in
November
Bob
Barr
He's
the
first
serious
candidate
the
LP
has
run
since
I've
been
eligible
to
vote
2
Who
did
you
vote
for
in
2004
and
2000
Kerry
in
2004
Bush
in
2000
3
Is
this
the
most
important
election
in
your
lifetime
No
There's
too
little
difference
between
the
major
party
candidates
for
there
to
be
much
riding
on
this
election
It's
really
only
a
matter
of
if
you
want
a
huge
federal
government
undertaking
grand
leftist
programs
or
if
you
want
a
huge
federal
government
undertaking
grand
rightist
programs
4
What
will
you
miss
about
the
Bush
administration
As
a
libertarian
journalist
they've
given
me
plenty
to
write
about
5
Leaving
George
W
Bush
out
of
consideration
what
former
U.S
president
would
you
most
like
to
have
waterboarded
Woodrow
Wilson
Jailed
political
dissenters
created
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
got
us
into
World
War
I
He
also
enacted
the
first
federal
income
tax
the
first
modern
military
draft
and
the
first
federal
drug
prohibition
Wilson
also
re-segregated
the
federal
government
When
blacks
protested
he
told
them
to
consider
segregation
a
benefit
not
a
debasement

all-around
loathesome

Corporate
Income
Tax
Video
I'm
amused
when
I
hear
Obama
talk
about
giving
tax
credits
to
American
companies
that
create
jobs
here
in
the
U.S
as
opposed
to
overseas
If
he
agrees
that
high
taxes
are
the
main
reason
why
U.S
companies
are
moving
jobs
overseas
wouldn't
it
be
a
better
idea
just
to
lower
the
corporate
income
tax
all
around
We
have
the
second-highest
corporate
income
tax
in
the
world
To
say
that
companies
should
stay
here
and
pay
the
penalty
out
of
patriotism
is
just
silly
Companies
can
and
should
make
decisions
that
benefit
shareholders
not
to
benefit
the
governments
of
whatever
borders
they
happen
to
be
located
between
In
any
case
that's
my
way
of
introducing
the
video
below
which
won
the
Tax
Foundation's
competition
for
best
YouTube
video
explaining
the
problems
with
the
corporate
income
tax

Wrong
Door
Drug
Raid
Except
this
time
the
intruders
were
criminals
When
armed
intruders
burst
into
her
Southeast
Portland
home
and
ordered
her
husband
and
her
roommate
to
the
floor
at
gunpoint
Emily
Morden
knew
it
had
to
be
a
terrible
mistake
One
of
the
men
yelled
Where's
Tim
and
barked
orders
The
intruders
began
to
bind
their
hands
with
duct
tape
They
accused
Morden's
23-year-old
roommate
of
being
a
drug
dealer
The
roommate
an
old
friend
lay
on
the
floor
in
pajamas
and
fuzzy
duck
slippers
Morden
started
to
protest
Tim
is
not
a
drug
dealer
He
works
at
Fred
Meyer
she
said
kneeling
before
the
gunman
but
refusing
to
lie
down
out
of
fear
of
what
would
happen
next
Are
you
sure
you
have
the
right
house
Turns
out
they
didn't
The
Tim
they
were
looking
for
was
the
medical
marijuana
grower
who
lived
next
door
There's
the
usual
argument
here
about
how
this
kind
of
thing
puts
people
in
an
even
more
precarious
position
when
trying
to
determine
if
the
people
breaking
into
their
homes
are
cops
or
criminals
posing
as
cops
But
reader
Brian
Courts
who
sent
me
the
article
had
another
observation
I
hadn't
considered
The
people
who
got
raided
by
these
criminals
were
actually
treated
better
than
most
of
the
people
wrongly
raided
by
the
police
Consider
1
No
one
was
shot
or
killed
And
no
dead
dogs
2
The
intruders
actually
apologized
when
they
realized
they
had
the
wrong
house
3
Now
that
they've
been
caught
the
intruders
will
actually
be
punished
for
terrorizing
a
home
full
of
innocent
people

Scandal
in
Louisiana's
Criminal
Courts
There's
a
major
scandal
brewing
in
Louisiana's
criminal
justice
system
Since
1994
Chief
Judge
Edward
Dufresne
has
been
handling
the
appeals
of
indigent
Louisiana
convicts
who
had
to
file
their
own
briefs
Last
year
the
aid
Dufresne
had
assigned
to
handle
those
appeals
committed
suicide
According
to
his
suicide
note
Jarrold
Peterson
killed
himself
in
part
because
of
the
guilt
he
faced
over
what
he
had
been
asked
to
do
as
part
of
his
job
Peterson
sent
a
posthumous
letter
to
Louisiana's
Judiciary
Commission
with
a
damning
allegation
He
said
Dufresne
had
instructed
him
to
deny
every
appeal
not
prepared
by
an
attorney
Peterson
said
he
was
instructed
to
write
up
and
file
the
denials
without
every
showing
the
appeals
to
the
judges
Peteson
handled
about
2,400
such
cases
in
the
13
years
he
was
in
charge
of
them
The
Louisiana
Supreme
Court
will
now
decide
if
the
investigation
of
the
allegations
and
the
review
of
those
cases
will
be
handled
by
another
circuit
and
outside
panel
or
the
same
5th
Circuit
court
where
all
of
this
may
have
happened
A
few
facts
about
Louisiana's
criminal
justice
system
that
might
be
helpful
in
putting
the
seriousness
of
this
scandal
into
perspective
About
90
percent
of
criminal
defendants
in
Louisiana
are
indigent
Louisiana
only
provides
post-conviction
legal
aid
in
death
penalty
cases
Everyone
else
must
either
hire
a
lawyer
find
a
lawyer
to
handle
their
case
pro
bono
or
handle
the
appeal
themselves
Obviously
most
have
no
choice
but
to
opt
for
the
latter
One
criminal
defense
lawyer
in
Louisiana
told
me
that
if
you're
convicted
of
murder
in
Louisiana
and
you're
innocent
you're
actually
better
off
getting
the
death
penalty
At
least
then
you'll
get
a
team
of
lawyers
investigators
and
experts
to
help
with
your
appeal
Because
convicts
aren't
considered
citizens
in
Louisiana
they
have
no
standing
to
make
requests
for
public
records
and
that
would
include
copies
of
their
own
case
files
Some
prosecutors
offices
will
grant
such
requests
anyway
but
they're
under
no
obligation
to
do
so
When
such
requests
are
granted
or
are
made
by
the
family
or
friends
of
the
defendant
defense
attorneys
tell
me
that
DA's
offices
charge
1-2
per
page
for
files
that
can
easily
run

So
what
Most
of
these
people
are
probably
guilty
anyway
right
Maybe
not
Earlier
this
month
the
Louisiana
Innocence
Project
released
a
study
of
36
death
penalty
convictions
won
by
the
office
of
former
New
Orleans
District
Attorney
Harry
Connick
yes
he's
the
father
of
the
famous
crooner
The
report
found
that
prosecutors
had
withheld
important
exculpatory
evidence
in
nine
cases
or
25
percent
In
four
cases
one
in
nine
death
sentences
the
condemned
defendant
was
later
declared
innocent
Given
that
these
were
death
penalty
cases
the
defendants
had
good
representation
from
the
state's
capital
post-conviction
office
Not
only
are
90
percent
of
defendants
in
non-capital
cases
left
to
find
such
abuses
in
their
own
cases
by
themselves
DAs
are
under
no
obligation
to
give
them
copies
of
their
own
case
files
can
charge
exhorbitant
fees
when
they
do
and
for
13
years
at
least
one
of
Louisiana's
appeals
courts
couldn't
even
bother
to
read
the
appeals
anyway
One
more
thing
to
consider
Many
Louisiana
DAs
have
been
sending
regular
work
to
former
Mississippi
medical
examiner
Dr
Steven
Hayne
and
his
disgraced
forensic
odontologist
sidekick
Dr
Michael
West
since
the
early
1990s

Depends
on
Your
Definition
of
Transparency
Last
week
I
noted
that
despite
assurances
from
Treasury
officials
that
the
bailout
largess
would
be
distributed
in
a
transparent
accountable
manner
one
of
the
first
big
contracts
awarded
by
the
federal
government
to
the
Bank
of
New
York
Mellon
had
the
actual
amount
of
money
to
be
paid
to
the
bank
redacted
before
the
contract
was
made
public
The
new
website
BailoutSleuth
now
reports
that
subsequent
bailout
contracts
to
PriceWaterhouseCoopers
Ernst
Young
and
the
law
firm
Simpson
Thatcher
Bartlett
were
also
posted
with
significant
information
redacted
No
matter
what
happens
to
the
economy
it
looks
like
business
and
finance
journalists
will
have
plenty
of
job
security
over
the
next
couple
of
years
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
track
how
the
government
spends
all
of
this
money
I
expect
debacles
at
least
on
par
with
the
awarding
of
contracts
in
Iraq
and
after
Hurricane
Katrina

John
McCain
We
Must
Stop
Coddling
Criminals
John
McCain
gets
all
1983
on
us
with
a
get-tough-on-crime
speech
Lax
enforcement
policies
judges
who
legislate
from
the
bench
and
lack
of
support
for
law
enforcement
personnel
all
continue
to
force
our
innocent
citizens
behind
the
barred
windows
of
their
homes
and
allow
criminals
to
roam
free
And
now
drugs
are
bringing
waves
of
crime
and
organized
gang
activity
to
rural
areas
thought
to
be
nearly
immune
from
such
problems
The
federal
government
must
both
support
state
and
local
law
enforcement
and
effectively
enforce
federal
laws
designed
to
root
out
violent
crime
organized
gangs
and
other
interstate
criminal
activity
I
will
appoint
judges
who
will
hold
criminals
accountable
Huh
You'd
never
know
from
such
speechifying
that
a
record
1
in
100
Americans
is
behind
bars
today
including
400,000
for
nonviolent
drug
crimes
Or
that
prosecutors
win
convictions
in
90-95
percent
of
their
cases
The
judges
are
letting
criminals
off
on
a
technicality
line
is
a
canard
Unfortunately
Obama
is
no
better
on
criminal
justice
policy

Wonder

someone

Wouldn't

punishing

with
increasingly
punitive
penalties
in
an
effort
to
make
driving
more
difficult
and
get
more

the

is
if
