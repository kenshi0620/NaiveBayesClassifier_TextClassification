If

you've
probably
noticed
that
I've
been
blogging
way
less

I've

getting
my
BS

Accountancy
Now
I
have
a
full

Unfortunately
I
don't
have

the

I

The
Problem
With
State
DB
Plans
I
think
this
is
one
reason
why
government
defined-benefit
plans
are
a
terrible
idea
Schwarzenegger
signed
a
bill
that
bars
state
investment
plans
from
investing
in
Sudan
because
of
the
Darfur
crisis
No
doubt
it's
well
intentioned
but
what
does
the
Darfur
crisis
have
to
do
with
getting
an
adequate
ROI
The
problem
is
that
decisions
are
being
made
on
a
political
basis
rather
than
an
economic
one
Since
CalPERS
has
hundreds
of
billions
in
assets
it
has
a
lot
of
clout
CalPERS
desparately
needs
to
be
reformed
into
a
defined-contribution
plan
so
individuals
can
control
where
the
money
goes
Update
After
rereading
the
last
sentence
opf
my
post
I
think
that
I
should
elaborate
more
If
individuals
controlled
where
their
contributions
went
they
could
base
their
decisions
on
politics
but
my
guess
is
their
main
concern
would
be
achieving
a
satisfactory
ROI

Terrible
Trade
Policy
Proposal
I'm
going
to
second
Dingel's
comment
he
believe's
that
this
is
one
of
the
worst
trade
policy
proposals
in
recent
memory
The
proposal
is
to
force
importers
to
obtain
a
government
certificate
to
import
goods
as
a
remedy
to
the
trade
deficit
Oddly
the
senators
that
are
proposing
the

law
argue
that
it's
a
market

question
though
How
do

All

training

workforce
assistance
programs
Is
that
the

same
as

Ouch

outsourcing

Take
that
Lou
Dobbs
Despite
much
handwringing
and
political
posturing
the
surge
of
job
outsourcing
by
increasing
productivity
has
actually
helped
raise
real
wages
for
low-skilled
U.S
workers
according
to
two
Princeton
University
economists
Also
it
looks
like
most
of
the
burden
of
the
corporate
income
tax
gets
passed
on
to
employees
domestic
labor
bears

How
To
Argue
With
A
Libertarian
I
found
this
post
to
be
so
accurate
that
it's
creepy
No
doubt
others
have
encountered
similar
situations
Here
are
a
few
gems
1
Attack
libertarians
for
their
motives
Advertise
your
own
in
the
process
Example
You
just
recite
propaganda
against
high
taxes
and
social
programs
because
of
greed
I
support
such
things
out
of
a
concern
for
those
in
need
This
particular
example
is
most
effective
if
need
greed
and
propaganda
are
left
undefined
4
Criticize
capitalism
by
its
worst
cases
But
do
not
ever
compare
these
to
the
worst
cases
of
statism
Example
The
Enron
scandal
was
the
product
of
unfettered
profit
seeking
under
capitalism
If
a
libertarian
replies
that
Stalin's
brutality
was
the
product
of
a
statist
program
change
the
subject
or
claim
that
your
brand
of
statism
precludes
such
abuses
Better
still
try
to
argue
that
Stalinism
was
actually
a
kind
of
capitalism
5
Always
interpret
any
criticism
of
government
programs
as
a
demand
for
perfection
and
attack
such
a
demand
as
unrealistic
Example
A
libertarian
might
argue
that
the
benefits
of
the
FDA
keeping
some
drugs
off
the
market
are
outweighed
by
the
costs
of
keeping
other
drugs
off
the
market
Engaging
this
argument
directly
can
be
a
real
quagmire
Instead
accuse
the
libertarian
of
using
perfection
as
the
standard
for
evaluating
government
activities
8
Criticize
libertarians
for
whatever
interaction
or
noninteraction
they
have
had
with
the
state
Example
Yet
another
libertarian
that
went
to
a
state
school
What
a
hypocrite
Alternately
Yet
another
libertarian
that
went
to
a
private
university
Of
course
the
super
rich
can
afford
to
be
libertarian
Since
the
government
is
involved
in
just
about
every
aspect
of
our
lives
it
should
be
easy
enough
to
find
a
similar
charge
to
make
against
any
libertarian
Whatever
the
personal
activities
of
a
libertarian
may
be
be
sure
to
find
fault
9
No
policy
should
ever
be
tried
until
it
has
already
been
tried
Example
Let
libertarians
point
to
a
successful
example
of
their
policies
being
implemented
before
we
consider
implementing
them
Be
sure
to
use
this
argument
like
a
taxicab
however
as
it
implies
that
no
government
program
should
ever
have
been
implemented
in
the
first
place
11
The
complexity
of
the
world
is
always
and
everywhere
an
argument
in
favor
of
government
intervention
Example
A
libertarian
might
argue
that
price
ceilings
will
lead
to
shortages
Do
not
waste
time
discusing
the
interplay
of
supply
and
demand
Istead
try
an
argument
like
Society
is
too
complex
for
simplistic
supply
and
demand
arguments
to
be
taken
seriously
So
the
government
should
implement
price
ceilings
Characterizing
libertarian
arguments
as
simplistic
is
helpful
too
as
it
makes
statists
seem
to
be
the
more
sophisticated
group
14
Disregard
the
possibility
that
libertarians
make
tradeoffs
in
their
own
lives
Example
You
claim
to
oppose
taxation
but
you
live
in
a
place
with
taxes
The
libertarian
in
question
will
argue
that
he
opposes
taxation
but
remains
in
his
present
place
of
residence
to
avoid
other
things
that
are
worse
than
taxes
such
as
even
higher
taxes
or
the
costs
of
leaving
the
country
Disregard
any
such
protest
Call
the
libertarian
a
hypocrite
16
Call
policies
by
names
that
presuppose
their
effectiveness
Example
I
can't
believe
that
libertarians
oppose
Aid
to
Families
with
Dependent
Children
AFDC
How
could
they
be
against
programs
that
aid
these
people
The
same
approach
is
suitable
for
anti-discrimination
laws
foreign
aid
affirmative
action
price
controls
guaranteed
access
to
health
care
fair
lending
laws
and
so

In

there's

be
made
for
going
from
an
income
tax
to
a
consumption
tax
but
that's
not

What's

FEMA
and
Corruption
A
new
study
argues
that
FEMA
relief
leads
to
more
corruption
Here's
the
abstract
Could
bad
weather
be
responsible
for
U.S
corruption
Natural
disasters
create
resource
windfalls
in
the
states
they
strike
by
triggering
federally-provided
natural
disaster
relief
Like
windfalls
created
by
the
natural
resource
curse
and
foreign
aid
disaster
relief
windfalls
may
also
increase
corruption
We
investigate
this
hypothesis
by
exploring
the
effect
of
FEMA-provided
disaster
relief
on
public
corruption
The
results
support
our
hypothesis
Each
additional
1
per
capita
in
average
annual
FEMA
relief
increases
corruption
nearly
2.5
percent
in
the
average
state
Eliminating
FEMA
disaster
relief
would
reduce
corruption
more
than
20
percent
in
the
average
state
Our
findings
suggest
that
notoriously
corrupt
regions
of
the
United
States
such
as
the
Gulf
Coast
are
notoriously
corrupt
because
natural
disasters
frequently
strike
them
They
attract
more
disaster
relief
making
them
more
corrupt

Rising
Drug
Prices
According
to
this
article
Prices
of
medicines
used
by
older
Americans
for
chronic
conditions
such
as
arthritis
and
high
cholesterol
are
rising
even
as
new
federal
drug
coverage
has
been
rolled
out
to
help
make
prescriptions
more
affordable
Do
you

it's
a
coincidence
that
the
two
events
are
occurring
at
the
same
time
I
don't
and
neither
does
Stefan
Karlsson
This
correlation
in
time
is
hardly
coincidential
as
this
is
just
what
you
could
expect
from
any
increase
in
subsidies
Subsidies
of
anything
will
increase
demand
something
which
in
turn
will
of
course
raise
prices
I
think
I
only
partially
agree
with
his
analysis
though
Subsidies
can
also
be
used
at
times
to
increase
supply
by
subsidising
the
production
of
a
good
thereby
lowering
prices
Of
course
that's
not
what's
happening
here
In
this
case
the
federal
government
is
subsidising
consumption
thereby
raising
demand
and
prices
along
with
it

CA
Cable
Reform
Adam
Summers
is
mildly
supportive
of
California's
cable
franchise
reform
The
legislation
A.B
2987
sponsored
by
Assembly
Speaker
Fabian
Núñez
D-Los
Angeles
and
Assemblyman
Lloyd
Levine
D-Van
Nuys
would
reform
the
anachronistic
cable
franchise
system
by
eliminating
the
costly
practice
for
providers
of
obtaining
cable
franchises
city
by
city
The
change
is
intended
to
open
up
cable
competition
to
telephone
companies
and
others
and
offer
consumers
greater
choice
and
lower
cable
bills
He
also
has
some
doubts
Perhaps
the
greatest
concern
however
is
that
the
concentration
of
franchise
power
in
the
state
could
actually
lead
to
higher
franchise
costs
and
more
burdensome
regulation

Postrel
on
organ
shortages
The
most
obvious
way
to
increase
the
supply
of
any
scarce
commodity
paying
more
for
it
is
illegal
Federal
law
blocks
transplant

from
compensating

in

above-board
process
with
full
legal
and
medical
protections
The

and
even

organ
brokers
are
the
kidney
equivalents
of

LEGALIZED
FINANCIAL
incentives
would
encourage
more
people
to

Donors
would
probably
still
be
relatively
rare
just
as
surrogate
mothers
are
Many
like
me
would
still
help
out
without
payment
just
as
some
people
get
paid
for
giving
blood
or
fighting
fires
while
others
do
it
for

Paying
donors
need
not

the

any
more
than
paying

centers
does
Compensation
could
in

Americans
who

The

Neal
at

what
I
consider
to
be

important
observation
The

cycle

drives
tuition
is
actually
easy
to
understand
Some
people
complain
that
tuition
is
too
high
and
demand
that

make
college
affordable
Politicians
to
get
votes
provide
student
aid
Then
schools
suddenly
able
to
get
more
money
raise
tuition
But
wait
that
makes
college
unaffordable
again
And
so
it
goes
