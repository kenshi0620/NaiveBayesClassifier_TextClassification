What
Greenhouse
Gas
Restrictions
Could
Do
to
Our
Economy
Writing
in
Investor's
Business
Daily
today
David
Ridenour
says
When
our
economic
bus
is
teetering
at
the
edge
of
a
cliff
it's
a
bad
time
to
throw
on
some
extra
weight
He's
talking
about
government-mandated
restrictions
on
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
what
they
could
do
to
our
economy

Charlie
Rangel's
Many
Scandals
Subject
of
Project
21
Commentary
in
Washington
Times
By
David
Almasi
Remember
how
Washington's
culture
of
corruption
played
such
a
large
role
in
the
2006
elections
The
issue
hasn't
gone
away
Consider
the
slow
burn
of
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
Chairman
Charles
Rangel
D-NY
Currently
the
number
of
allegations
of
questionable
ethics
of
his
part
number
at
six
ranging
from
allegations
of
abuse
of
the
rules
of
the
House
garage
to
allegedly
not
filing
proper
disclosures
of
income
to
allegedly
using
House
resources
to
raise
money
for
a
non-governmental
pet
project
Project
21's
Council
Nedd
wrote
a
commentary
about
the
Rangel
situation
that
recently
appeared
in
The
Washington
Times
Council
pointed
out
the
irony
that
Rangel's
1970
election
was
due
in
part
to
the
scandal-plagued
history
of
his
predecessor
Adam
Clayton
Powell
Jr
Council
wrote
in
part
Four
decades
later
Mr
Rangel
is
experiencing
uncanny
parallels
to
situations
that
destroyed
Mr
Powell's
congressional
career
Despite
the
ignominious
circumstances
of
Mr
Powell's
forced
retirement
he
remains
fondly
remembered
for
his
civil
rights
work
and
his
pre-scandal
legislative
accomplishments
History
may
not
be
so
kind
to
Mr
Rangel
since
he
and
his
colleagues
assumed
power
on
a
promise
to
clean
up
Washington's
culture
of
corruption
It
is
troubling
when
Mr
Rangel
pleads
ignorance
about
his
tax
problems
more
so
when
one
considers
that
he
heads
the
committee
tasked
with
writing
the
nation's
tax
laws
Mr
Powell
was
stripped
of
his
committee
chairmanship
by
his
Democratic
colleagues
and
later
expelled
by
a
vote
of
the
entire
House
He
did
win
back
his
seat
but
after
years
of
legal
squabbling
Harlem
voters
chose
to
replace
him
with
Mr
Rangel
The
House
Ethics
Committee
is
now
investigating
many
of
the
charges
against
Mr
Rangel
Despite
promises
of
stronger
ethics
House
Speaker
Nancy
Pelosi
appears
to
have
no
intention
thus
far
of
disciplining
a
man
she
calls
very
distinguished
Mr
Rangel
was
elected
in
part
to
clean
up
Mr
Powell's
mess
Now
he
has
become
his
own
mess
It
reflects
poorly
on
him
and
hurts
Harlem
and
Washington
Harlem
needs
another
renaissance
an
ethical
one
this
time

Commentary
on
Green
Policies
Hurting
Blacks
Bottom
Line
By
David
Almasi
As
cooler
weather
approaches
there
are
indications
that
it
is
going
to
be
both
a
cold
and
expensive
winter
Scientifically-monitored
sunspot
activity
and
the
wise
Farmer's
Almanac
both
predict
it
will
be
cooler
than
normal
and
the
federal
government
is
predicting
the
cost
of
heating
a
home
will
be
a
lot
higher
Already
earning
less
than
the
average
American
household
black
and
brown
households
will
take
the
biggest
hit
unless
something
is
done
now
and
over
the
long-term
to
bring
down
energy
prices
Project
21
Deneen
Borelli
has
a
new
commentary
that
was
published
today
on
The
Root
a
black-focused
web
site
jointly
operated
by
The
Washington
Post
and
Professor
Henry
Louis
Gates
Jr
of
Harvard
University
Deneen
points
out
how
policies
promoted
by
radical
environmentalists
and
their
political
allies
on
Capitol
Hill
are
keeping
us
from
tapping
into
America's
rich
natural
resources
and
freeing
our
nation
from
foreign
energy
dependence
Failing
schools
crime
and
single-parent
households
are
just
a
few
of
the
challenges
facing
urban
communities
Now
thanks
to
radical
environmentalists
and
their
supporters
a
bunch
I
like
to
call
Club
Green
they
must
face
soaring
energy
as
well
Despite
the
hype
about
wind
power
and
boasts
about
other
renewable
energy
sources
85
percent
of
our
nation's
energy
comes
from
fossil
fuels
Energy
from
renewable
sources
such
as
wind
and
solar
only
currently
provide
about
7
percent
of
our
power
and
cannot
replace
fossil
fuels
anytime
soon
In
its
September
2008
report
the
federal
Energy
Information
Agency
predicted
a
25
percent
rise
in
heating
oil
prices
and
a
17
percent
rise
in
natural
gas
prices
this
winter
as
well
as
a
9.5
percent
projected
increase
in
electricity
costs
in
2009
Adding
to
that
gasoline
still
hovers
near
4
a
gallon
and
the
public
demands
more
domestic
energy
production
A
recent
Rasmussen
poll
of
likely
voters
found
that
67
percent
supported
new
offshore
fossil
fuel
exploration
Our
nation
is
blessed
with
an
abundant
supply
of
natural
resources
The
problem
is
that
Congress
at
the
demand
of
Club
Green
blocks
access
to
these
resources
at
the
peril
of
families

Slavery
Apology
and
Reparations
Debate
Neglects
Pressing
Matters
of
the
Present
Day
By
David
Almasi
A
commentary
by
Project
21
staff
research
associate
Stephen
Roberts
about
the
reaction
to
a
recent
congressional
apology
for
slavery
was
published
by
The
Washington
Times
this
past
Saturday
In
his
commentary
Roberts
discusses
the
need
to
get
past
the
slavery
issue
in
order
to
address
present-day
problems
facing
black
Americans
Reparations
further
muddle
the
pursuit
of
modern
progress
Roberts
writes
With
this
diversity
of
outcomes
in
mind
how
are
activists
and
lawmakers
dealing
with
an
apology
for
slavery
They
are
doing
what
they
do
best
playing
politics
In
calling
it
just
a
large
step
Mr
Cummings
skillfully
leaves
open
the
door
to
ask
for
more
namely
reparations
A
Toledo
Blade
editorial
made
clear
the
apology
cost
nothing
calling
it
an
empty
gesture
of
little
use
to
the
victims
it
is
meant
to
make
feel
better
Quoted
in
the
Final
Call
Professor
Michael
Eric
Dyson
said
Reparations
are
certainly
one
of
the
signals
that
America
can
send
if
they
are
serious
about
reconstituting
American
culture
The
problem
with
the
apology
debate
and
the
ensuing
racial
backbiting
is
the
consequent
neglect
of
the
pressing
matters
of
the
present
day
Columnist
Christopher
Caldwell
notes
there
are
no
more
slave
owners
or
Jim
Crow
laws
Segments
of
black
America
however
are
currently
trapped
in
cyclic
poverty
What
can
be
done
for
them
that
does
not
involve
historical
naval-gazing
or
polarizing
stereotyped
groups
that
no
longer
technically
exist

Plan
on

Thursday
Listen
Live
By
David
Almasi
Steve
Milloy
a
director
of
the
National
Center's
newly-announced
Free
Enterprise
Project
will
be
a
guest
of
Clarence
Mitchell
IV
on
WBAL
radio
in
Baltimore
this
afternoon
at
1:30
pm
eastern
Steve
will
discuss
his
comments
yesterday
warning
Congress
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
grant
excessive
new
powers
to
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
Henry
Paulson
and
other
cabinet
officials
and
their
successors
under
any
financial
bailout
legislation
You
can
listen
to
Steve
from
anywhere
in
America
by
going
to
the
WBAL
web
site
and
clicking
the
Listen
Live
tab
that
can
be
found
at
the
top
left
of
the
page
In
a
release
on
the
topic
of
Paulson
and
the
bailout
yesterday
Milloy
noted
Paulson
should
not
be
given
more
opportunities
to
punish
his
enemies
and
promote
his
friends
Engineering
the
sale
of
Bear
Sterns
at
a
fire
sale
price
and
allowing
Lehman
Brothers
to
go
bankrupt
while
making
efforts
to
save
Goldman
Sachs
should
raise
serious
questions
about
Paulson's
personal
agenda
Having
served
in
the
Nixon
Administration
it
seems
Paulson
took
careful
notes
in
the
creation
and
execution
of
an
enemies
list
Let's
not
forget
that
under
Paulson's
leadership
Goldman
Sachs
made
millions
by
creating
the
mortgage
crisis

Chairman
Mychal

Bailout
Controversy
By

Mychal

the

of
the
Project

black

network
Project

has
this
to
say
about
our
nation's
current
financial
mess
and
those
willing
to
do
anything
but
let
free
market
mechanisms
bring
things
back
to
normal
Our
nation's
current
financial
turmoil
should
be
no
surprise
to
those
charged
with
overseeing
our
financial
system
yet
those
yelling
the
loudest
about
our
not
being
prepared
seem
to
have
been
the
ones
with
their
heads
in
the
sand
the
longest
Case
in
point
When
the
Bush
Administration
suggested
a
regulatory
overhaul
of
the
housing
finance
industry
in
2003
Representative
Barney
Frank
D-MA
said
These
two
entities
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
are
not
facing
any
kind
of
financial
crisis
The
more
people
exaggerate
these
problems
the
more
pressure
there
is
on
these
companies
the
less
we
will
see
in
terms
of

ways
to
game
the

to
correct
the
very
problem
that
government
negligence
allowed

happen
in

place
It
is
unwise
for
the

presume
American

It
is
a
misrepresentation
of
that
which

as

It
is
a

a
wholesale
bailout

ad

It
is
simply
unfair
and
unjust
for
taxpayers

essentially
be
the

for
those
responsible
for
foreseeable
economic
misdeeds
on
a
gargantuan

Commentary
in
The
Root
Sets
a
New
Mission
for
Black
Colleges
By
David
Almasi
This
week
the
White
House
is
focusing
attention
on
historically-black
colleges
and
universities
HBCUs
with
an
official
week
of
commemoration
and
a
conference
sponsored
by
the
U.S
Department
of
Education
Project
21
member
B.B
Robinson
Ph.D
is
marking
the
week
by
calling
on
HBCUs
to
commit
more
resources
to
train
students
in
science
and
technology
to
meet
the
growing
demand
in
those
fields
This
Robinson
believes
will
help
foster
further
black
prosperity
and
help
equalize
employment
opportunities
Since
this
will
obviously
drain
tight
budgets
Robinson
offers
a
suggestion
HBCUs
should
cut
back
their
athletic
programs
In
his
commentary
on
the
subject
which
was
published
by
The
Root
a
black-focused
web
site
jointly
operated
by
The
Washington
Post
and
Professor
Henry
Louis
Gates
Jr
of
Harvard
University
Robinson
wrote
Among
black
students
in
particular
there
is
a
distinct
technological
training
deficit
According
to
Science
and
Engineering
Indicators
2008
from
the
federal
National
Science
Board
only
8.4
percent
of
college
graduates
in
2005
who
received
degrees
in
science
and
engineering
were
black
There
has
been
a
slow
and
steady
increase
of
black
science
and
engineering
graduates
over
the
surveyed
period
of
1985
to
2005
but
this
black
progress
was
nonetheless
outpaced
by
Hispanic
and
Asian
gains
Compounding
the
problem
of
so
few
blacks
receiving
science
and
engineering
degrees
is
that
a
consistent
rate
of
over
30
percent
of
incoming
black
freshmen
over
the
years
regularly
intend
on
pursuing
such
majors
while
less
than
a
third
actually
obtain
a
degree
Given
that
their
budgets
and
access
to
resources
are
limited
how
can
HBCUs
increase
their
science
and
technology
focus
They
should
not
Rob
Peter
to
pay
Paul
They
should
simply
take
Peter
out
of
the
equation
The
HBCUs
Peter
is
money-losing
athletic
programs
HBCUs
should
consider
converting
resources
set
aside
for
athletic
programs
into
resources
for
scientific
research
and
development
For
the
future
of
black
America
HBCUs
and
the
nation
it
seems
appropriate
that
HBCUs
turn
their
athletic
and
competitive
swords
and
spears
into
productive
and
scientific
plowshares
and
pruning
hooks

to

saying
There
may

we
all

but
the
one
I
have
right
now
doesn't
have
a

panel
or
hydrogen
converter
It
takes
gasoline
While
I
don't
object
to
the
possibility
of
alternative
energy
sources
in
the
future
I
know
that
most
Americans
own
cars
that
need
gas
and
live
in
homes
that
are
powered
at
least
in
part
by
coal
When
the
elites
stifle
access
to
plentiful
power
the
financial
burden
is
a
lot
smaller
for
them
They
can
afford
to
pay
more
for
a
hybrid
car
and
rave
about
getting
better
gas
mileage
They
can
also
feel
better
about
their
indulgences
when
they
buy
imaginary
carbon
credits
that
give
them
the
moral
authority
to
use
more

describes
her
own

not
to
be
part
of
such
a
process
Deneen
wrote
in
part
Frustrated
by
what
appears
to
me
to
be
a
long
history
of
Mr
Jackson
and
Mr
Sharpton
using
semi-subtle
campaigns
to
pressure
corporations
to
donate
I
spoke
up
at
the
JPMorgan
shareholder
meeting
After
Mr
Jackson
spoke
I
took
his
place
at
the
microphone
and
asked
Mr
Dimon
and
his
board
Will
there
ever
be
a
day
where
you
will
stand
up
and
say
No
to
Mr
Jackson
and
to
his
demands
and
messages
of
victimization
and
divisiveness
This
is
the

this

the

Sweet

The
Last
Step
to
Black
Freedom
by
psychologist
Dr
James
Davidson
Jr
although
he
criticizes
liberals
Davidson
is
quick
to
note
he
is
no
conservative
He
writes
My
behaviors
and
ideas
are
anything
but
conservative
Trying
to
improve
one's
social
and
economic
lot
by
rejecting
traditional
societal
and
black
community
standards
for
achievement
seemed
antithetical
to
being
conservative

apolitical

of

is
to
create

simply
not

thrilled
about

the

begging
an

in

that
don't
really
have

that

not

Why

Detroit

Suggestions
Finally
Acted
Upon
By
David
Almasi
After
months
of
controversy
Detroit
Mayor
Kwame
Kilpatrick
D
finally
admitted
his
guilt
this
morning
and
resigned
from
office
He
pleaded
guilty
to
two
felony
counts
of
obstruction
of
justice
related
to
his
lying
under
oath
during
a
police
investigation
into
his
political
inner-circle
In
addition
to
Kilpatrick's
resignation
he
is
expected
to
serve
up
to
four
months
in
jail
five
years
of
probation
up
to
a
1
million
in
fines
and
at
least
a
temporary
revocation
of
his
law
license

party

or

Detroit
Mayor
Kwame
Kilpatrick
King
Kwame
or
the
Hip-Hop
Mayor
to
some
is
yet
another
example
of
a
politician
drowning
in
his
own
narcissistic
sense
of
infallibility
The
opportunity
to
earn
the
public
trust
is
a
privilege
and
politicians
often
forget
who
they
are
working
for
Anyone
aware
of
Mayor
Kirkpatrick's
tenure
shouldn't
be
surprised
Arrogance
and
a
sense
of
entitlement
are
a
recipe
for
disaster
especially
when
the
resources
of
an
entire
city
are
at
one's
disposal
and
yes
men
who
occupy
high-ranking
city
positions
act
as
enablers
She
added
I'm
sick
and
tired
of
people
saying
the
very
serious
felony
charges
are
the
product
of
an
overambitious
prosecutor's
witch-hunt
over
a
sexual
affair
Let's
not
forget
that
Mayor
Kilpatrick
not
only
took
an
oath
to
uphold
his
office
with
honor
but
another
to
honor
his
marriage
He
has
apparently
failed
miserably
at
both
and
has
only
himself
to
blame
We
all
make
mistakes
but
part
of
learning
from
those
mistakes
is
accepting
responsibility
for
them
This
often
requires
paying
a
heavy
price
No
one
is
above
the
law
Not
even
Mayor
Kilpatrick
Not
even
in
Detroit
No
matter
how
large
the
entourage
how
luxurious
the
vehicle
or
how
flamboyant
his
clothing
he
is
still
a
public
servant
accountable
to
the
people
of
Detroit
If
the
Hip-Hop
Mayor
wants
to
live
the
lifestyle
of
a
50
Cent
he
needs
to
relinquish
his
public
office
and
become
a
member
of
G-Unit
on
his
own
time
not
on
the
taxpayers
dime

A
Funny
Quote
David
Ridenour
shares
his
appreciation
of
a
recent
Mark
Steyn
column
This
comes
from
Mark
Steyn
in
the
latest
edition
of
Hillsdale's
Imprimis
Steyn
describes
how
in
order
to
ensure
that
Muslims
aren't
offended
local
British
councils
are
banning
workers
from
displaying
Pooh's
Piglet
on
their
desks
British
banks
have
stopped
giving
away
piggy
banks
and
all
sorts
of
other
absurdities
Here's
Steyn's
funny
quote
As
Pastor
Martin
Niemoller
might
have
said
First
they
came
for
Piglet
and
I
did
not
speak
out
because
I
was
not
a
Disney
character
and
if
I
was
I'd
be
more
of
an
Eeyore
Then
they
came
for
the
Three
Little
Piges
and
Babe
and
by
the
time
I
realized
the
Western
world
had
turned
into
a
24/7
Looney
Tunes
it
was
too
late
because
there
was
no
Porky
Pig
to
stammer
Th-th-th-that's
all
folks
and
bring
the
nightmare
to
an
end
Okay
Maybe
Pastor
Niemoller
won't
have
put
it
exactly
that
way

The
Chicago
Annenberg
Challenge's
Mysterious
Files
As
an
executive
of
a
non-profit
foundation
I
read
with
interest
the
article
by
Stanley
Kurtz
of
the
Ethics
and
Public
Policy
Center
about
the
mysteriously
flexible
ownership
of
132
boxes
of
files
of
a
now-defunct
non-profit
called
the
Chicago
Annenberg
Challenge
Mr
Kurtz
wishes
to
review
these
files
which
are
in
the
possession
of
the
Richard
J
Daley
Library
at
the
University
of
Illinois
at
Chicago
a
publicly-supported
institution
because
he
is
researching
the
relationship
between
a
former
member
of
the
Weather
Underground
Bill
Ayers
and
the
junior
U.S
Senator
from
Illinois
Both
men
were
officials
of
the
Chicago
Annenberg
Challenge
a
non-profit
organization
before
the
group
closed
in
2001
A
bit
of
a
mystery
has
developed
because
the
Daley
Library
having
not
long
ago
gone
out
of
its
way
to
make
the
Chicago
Annenberg
Challenge
files
available
to
Mr
Kurtz
for
his
research
suddenly
withheld
its
permission
The
ins-and-outs
of
the
story
are
best
learned
by
reading
Mr
Kurtz's
article
but
the
short
version
is
that
a
concern
by
the
Daley
Library
that
it
does
not
have
the
legal
right
to
display
the
material
has
suddenly
emerged
The
library
told
Mr
Kurtz
it
was
working
with
the
donor
to
resolve
this
problem
but
it
declined
to
tell
Mr
Kurtz
the
identity
of
the
donor
Mr
Kurtz
then
speculates
that
among
other
possibilities
Mr
Ayres
himself
a
former
CAC
executive
may
be
the
donor
That's
the
part
I
noted
with
interest
because
I
don't
think
he
is
likely
to
be
Bill
Ayres
could
only
legally
donate
the
CAC
documents
to
the
Daley
Library
if
he
had
legal
ownership
himself
Odds
are
that
he
doesn't
have
it
and
never
has
Under
the
tax
laws
if
a
non-profit
goes
out
of
business
it
must
transfer
any
remaining
assets
to
another
non-profit
It
can't
just
give
its
assets
to
a
person
unless
the
assets
are
transferred
as
taxable
compensation
and
properly
declared
or
it
is
returning
a
contribution
which
would
be
irrelevant
here
If
Bill
Ayres
has
the
physical
property
of
a
closed
non-profit
he
MIGHT
properly
have
it
because
he
took
the
files
as
part
of
his
taxable
compensation
or
because
he
bought
the
property
from
the
non-profit
for
its
fair
market
value
but
the
odds
that
he
did
so
are
not
great
Few
employees
accept
old
files
as
taxable
compensation
and
few
non-profit
executives
would
want
to
pay
cash
for
132
boxes
of
a
dying
group's
old
files
Buying
the
non-profit's
property
would
be
particularly
dicey
for
Ayers
too
because
as
an
executive
of
the
non-profit
he's
an
insider
and
thus
subject
to
stiff
penalties
if
the
IRS
ever
were
to
determine
that
he
bought
assets
from
the
group
for
less
than
its
fair
market
value
So
if
he
bought
the
files
he
would
have
incurred
a
legal
tax
risk
to
do
so
only
to
then
donate
however
ineffectively
the
files
he'd
just
bought
to
the
Daley
Library
It's
just
not
likely
that
he
took
a
risk
to
buy
the
files
just
to
give
them
away
IF
Ayres
actually
is
the
donor
he
probably
kept
the
files
when
he
shouldn't
have
itself
unlikely
because
132
boxes
of
files
wouldn't
be
convenient
to
cart
about
and
then
gave
them
to
the
Daley
Library
If
that's
the
case
he
wasn't
entitled
to
keep
them
nor
to
give
them
to
the
Library
and
the
Library
has
stolen
property
If
this
is
the
case
Ayres
wouldn't
personally
have
the
legal
authority
to
give
or
not
give
consent
over
whether
the
files
now
are
open
for
public
viewing
and
under
what
conditions
because
they
aren't
his
files
and
never
were
My
guess
is
that
Ayres
isn't
the
donor
at
all
even
if
in
his
capacity
as
an
official
of
a
non-profit
he
once
played
a
role
in
their
transfer
to
the
library
I
have
no
idea
if
he
did
I
further
suspect
that
no
individual
person
donated
the
files
I
believe
they
were
donated
either
by
the
non-profit
Chicago
Annenberg
Challenge
itself
or
by
the
non-profit
to
which
as
Mr
Kurtz
reports
the
CAC
transferred
its
remaining
assets
upon
its
closure
the
Chicago
Public
Education
Fund
The
Chicago
Public
Education
Fund
is
a
non-profit
as
is
the
Daley
Library
As
such
it
would
have
been
perfectly
legal
for
the
CAC
to
give
its
files
to
the
Chicago
Public
Education
Fund
and
for
the
Chicago
Public
Education
Fund
to
in
turn
give
the
files
to
the
library
A
CAC-Daley
Library
transfer
would
have
been
equally
legal
and
quite
understandable
as
CAC
executives
may
have
seen
the
files
as
part
of
the
group's
legacy
and
may
have
have
wanted
the
group's
work
to
be
remembered
Such
a
donation
of
files
to
the
Daley
Library
could
have
been
arranged
by
Bill
Ayres
himself
or
someone
reporting
to
him
in
his
capacity
as
a
CAC
official
but
even
if
Ayres
personally
carried
all
132
boxes
from
CAC
offices
to
the
library
on
his
bicycle
the
donation
legally
would
have
come
from
the
non-profit
Now
that
CAC
is
closed
any
authority
any
CAC
executive
or
officer
had
as
a
CAC
official
over
CAC
assets
has
evaporated
So
unless
its
staff
knew
nothing
whatsoever
about
the
law
the
Daley
Library
would
not
now
contact
Ayres
or
any
other
ex-CAC
official
acting
in
that
capacity
to
get
a
signed
deed
of
gift
or
to
request
permission
to
do
anything
whatsoever
with
the
CAC
files
If
the
Chicago
Public
Education
Fund
truly
was
given
all
of
CAC's
remaining
assets
when
CAC
closed
as
Mr
Kurtz's
article
says
and
if
the
CAC
files
weren't
properly
or
fully
gifted
to
the
library
as
library
official
Ann
C
Weller
implied
to
Mr
Kurtz
the
files
probably
belong
to
the
Chicago
Public
Education
Fund
A
list
of
the
Fund's
board
can
be
found
here
As
the
Fund
is
a
non-profit
barred
from
electoral
activity
the
Fund's
board
presumably
would
want
to
be
very
careful
not
to
make
any
decisions
regarding
document
access
that
are
less
than
scrupulously
neutral
If
on
the
other
hand
the
Daley
Library
owns
the
files
as
it
apparently
believed
it
until
very
recently
its
governing
board
will
face
the
same
need
to
be
scrupulously
neutral
on
political
matters
assuming
the
University
of
Illinois
system
operates
as
a
non-profit
to
which
donations
are
tax-deductible
under
federal
tax
laws
as
many
universities
do

Project
21's
Borelli
on
Civil
Rights
Shakedowns
in
Philadelphia
Inquirer
By
David
Almasi
An
article
critical
of
activists
Al
Sharpton
and
Jesse
Jackson
by
Project
21
Fellow
Deneen
Borelli
was
published
Friday
in
the
Philadelphia
Inquirer
Said
Deneen
Al
Sharpton
is
making
headlines
again
but
it's
not
for
one
of
his
crusades
Instead
Sharpton
his
National
Action
Network
NAN
and
several
major
corporations
that
have
donated
to
NAN
have
been
subpoenaed
in
recent
months
by
federal
investigators
While
Sharpton's
attorneys
reported
Tuesday
that
the
criminal
probe
over
millions
allegedly
owed
in
taxes
by
Sharpton
and
NAN
has
been
dropped
in
lieu
of
civil
action
by
the
IRS
federal
authorities
remain
tight-lipped
over
the
status
of
any
investigations
Critics
have
long
accused
Sharpton
of
obtaining
corporate
contributions
by
threatening
racial
boycotts
Sharpton
denies
this
saying
That's
the
old
shakedown
theory
that
the
anti-civil-rights
forces
have
used
against
us
forever
But
there's
plenty
to
wonder
about
In
November
2003
according
to
the
New
York
Post
Sharpton
picketed
a
DaimlerChrysler
air
show
threatening
a
boycott
After
the
company
began
sponsoring
NAN's
annual
conference
in
2004
however
Sharpton
bestowed
an
award
on
it
for
corporate
excellence
General
Motors
and
American
Honda
also
began
giving
to
the
group
after
similar
threats
Sharpton's
not
alone
Critics
of
Jesse
Jackson
claim
he
has
perfected
the
art
of
the
shakedown
Suspicions
persist
for
instance
about
motives
behind
repeated
generous
contributions
from
mortgage
giant
Freddie
Mac
to
Jackson's
Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition
As
the
National
Legal
and
Policy
Center
has
reported
Jesse
Jackson's
relationship
with
Freddie
Mac
began
in
1998
when
Jackson
accused
Freddie
Mac
of
racial
discrimination
and
encouraged
major
shareholders
to
sell
their
stock
Freddie
Mac
began
financial
support
for
Jackson's
organizations
and
his
criticism
of
Freddie
Mac
stopped
Freddie
Mac
donated
150,000
to
a
Rainbow/PUSH
conference
earlier
this
month
even
as
Congress
was
debating
a
bailout
of
the
struggling
firm
and
Fannie
Mae
a
bailout
that
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
says
might
cost
taxpayers
as
much
as
100
billion
A
16-year
crusade
against
Anheuser-Busch
for
not
having
enough
minority
beer
distributors
ended
with
Jackson's
sons
being
awarded
a
lucrative
Chicago
distributorship
Businesses
that
Jackson
has
criticized
including
Toyota
and
NASCAR
have
become
sponsors
of
his
annual
Wall
Street
Conference...Deneen
then
discussed
her
own
experience
challenging
Jackson
directly
at
the
recent
JPMorgan
Chase
and

On
Michael
Savage
and
Autism
an
Appeal
for
Calm
Those
of
us
who
follow
talk
radio
and/or
autism-related
issues
are
aware
that
a
campaign
has
sprung
up
calling
for
the
firing
of
syndicated
radio
host
Michael
Savage
Speaking
on
his
July
16
broadcast
Savage
claimed
that
99
percent
of
autism
cases
are
fake
that
they
actually
are
examples
of
kids
misbehaving
and
bad
parenting
According
to
Media
Matters
Savage
said
I'll
tell
you
what
autism
is
In
99
percent
of
the
cases
it's
a
brat
who
hasn't
been
told
to
cut
the
act
out
That's
what
autism
is
What
do
you
mean
they
scream
and
they're
silent
They
don't
have
a
father
around
to
tell
them
Don't
act
like
a
moron
You'll
get
nowhere
in
life
Stop
acting
like
a
putz
Straighten
up
Act
like
a
man
Don't
sit
there
crying
and
screaming
idiot
Savage
concluded
I]f
I
behaved
like
a
fool
my
father
called
me
a
fool
And
he
said
to
me
Don't
behave
like
a
fool
The
worst
thing
he
said
Don't
behave
like
a
fool
Don't
be
anybody's
dummy
Don't
sound
like
an
idiot
Don't
act
like
a
girl
Don't
cry
That's
what
I
was
raised
with
That's
what
you
should
raise
your
children
with
Stop
with
the
sensitivity
training
You're
turning
your
son
into
a
girl
and
you're
turning
your
nation
into
a
nation
of
losers
and
beaten
men
That's
why
we
have
the
politicians
we
have
In
response
Savage
says
his
comments
were
taken
out
of
context
by
Media
Matters
He
explained
his
views
more
fully
this
week
telling
Jacques
Steinberg
of
the
New
York
Times
for
example
that
the
99
percent
fakery
figure
was
hyperbole
On
his
own
website
Savage
called
on
people
not
to
make
a
rush
to
judgement
about
his
views
based
solely
upon
the
charges
of
critics
He
added
that
his
comments
were
actually
in
support
of
truly
autistic
children
who
he
said
lose
out
on
services
and
funding
they
need
because
money
is
pilfered
by
those
who
are
not
autistic
The
truly
autistic
child
needs
as
much
help
as
he
or
she
can
get
he
said
what
he
opposes
is
fakery
Nonetheless
calls
for
Savage
to
pay
a
severe
professional
penalty
continue
A
big
advertiser
stopped
advertising
a
seven-station
radio
network
in
Mississippi
dropped
the
show
and
there
have
been
calls
for
Savage's
firing
The
group
AutismLink
circulated
a
letter
Monday
evening
saying
it
is
calling
on
autism
organizations
to
sign
a
petition
calling
for
Savage's
firing
Tuesday
afternoon
the
group
circulated
the
following
list
of
organizations
and
individuals
it
said
have
called
for
Savage's
firing

My
sense
of
this
is
that
those
who
are
calling
for
Savage's
firing
should
calm
down
Savage
clearly
has
sympathy
for
children
disabled
by
autism
His
greatest
offense
was
that
his
disgust
over
what
he
believes
is
people
using
autism
for
financial
gain
encouraged
him
to
exaggerate
the
extent
to
which
autism
is
overdiagnosed
and
the
ease
with
which
genuine
autism
which
presently
is
incurable
can
be
cured
The
hyperbole
was
not
helpful
but
it
should
not
be
confused
with
an
attack
on
the
genuinely
disabled

Government
Pirates
The
Assault
on
Private
Property
Rights
and
How
We
Can
Fight
It
David
Ridenour
shared
news
of
a
new
property
rights
information
resource
with
the
National
Center
for
Public
Policy
Research's
email
list
last
night
Dear
Friend
I'm
writing
to
tell
you
about
an
excellent
new
book
and
exceptional
resource
that
will
be
released
tomorrow
Government
Pirates
The
Assault
on
Private
Property
Rights
and
How
We
Can
Fight
It
It
was
written
by
my
friend
Don
Corace
and
I
had
the
privilege
of
getting
an
advance
peak
at
the
book
The
book
details
a
series
of
property
rights
horror
stories
some
that
you've
no
doubt
heard
about
such
as
the
Kelo
v
City
of
New
London
eminent
domain
case
and
some
that
might
be
unfamiliar
to
you
Corace
tells
the
story
for
example
of
Jim
and
Tom
Stephanis
who
fought
the
City
of
Pompano
Beach
to
build
a
hotel
on
a
1.3-acre
site
where
their
restaurant
once
stood
They
fought
the
city
for
31
years
during
which
time
the
Pompano
government
officials
stonewalled
the
project
through
bureaucratic
shenanigans
and
frivolous
lawsuits
The
city
even
deliberately
violated
a
court
order
The
Stephanis
brothers
won
nine
consecutive
lawsuits
and
numerous
appeals
before
a
chief
justice
of
the
Florida
Supreme
Court
intervened
ordering
an
appeals
venue
change
and
hand-picking
the
judges
who
would
hear
the
case
a
highly-irregular
and
controversial
move
This
was
the
turning
point
in
their
battle
and
the
Stephanises
ultimately
lost
millions
they'd
invested
in
the
project
Within
a
year
of
their
final
blow
the
U.S
Supreme
Court
refusing
to
hear
their
case
Jim
Stephanis
suffered
a
major
stroke
Today
he
works
as
a
wine
manager
for
a
liquor
store
His
brother
Tom
is
retired
Government
Pirates
provides
especially
good
insights
on
how
government
and
outside
special
interests
collaborate
to
take
away
Americans
property
rights
As
a
successful
real
estate
developer
Corace
has
seen
this
process
up-close
first-hand
If
you'd
like
to
take
a
look
at
sample
pages
of
the
book
or
see
where
you
can
tune
in
to

Don
Corace
talking

the
book
he'll
be

Apparently
complacent
about
criticism
from
the

that
his

at
his
Nashville
home
is
more
than
19

American
household's
Al
Gore
has
committed
conspicious
energy
consumption
once
again
In
Washington
D.C
Thursday
to
deliver
yet
another
speech
warning
Americans
about
global
warming
caused
Gore
believes
by
excessive
use
of
fossil
fuels
Gore
handed
yet
more
evidence
to
critics
who
believe
he's
a
hypocrite
He
did
so
by
traveling
to
his
speech
in
what
almost
certainly
was
an
unnecessary
entourage
of
three
luxury
gas-guzzling
vehicles
two
Lincoln
Town
Cars
and
a
Surburban
SUV
one
of
which
was
kept
idling
outside
for
twenty
minutes
apparently
to
keep
the
interior
cool
for
the
driver
Mrs
Gore
and
the
Gores
adult
daughter
We
know
this
because
the
free-market
group
Americans
for
Prosperity
took
a
video
camera
to
the
speech
to
film
not
only
the
Gore
family's
vehicle
choices
but
to
interview
Gore
acolytes
who
declined
sponsors
advice
to
walk
ride
a
bike
or
take
public
transportation
to
the
speech
You
can
see
the
group's
very
funny
four-minute
video
online
here
my
favorite
part
is
the
woman
who
tries
to
claim

Gore's
speech
received
a
significant
amount
of
media
attention
I
surveyed
articles
from
major
news
sources
except
for
the
Huffington

I
excluded
opinion

to
see
how
many
journalists
covered

decision
to
take
three
luxury
gas-guzzlers
to
a

decrying

Cap
and
Trade
Carbon
Policies
Could
Increase
Emissions
Says
Justin
Danhof
Cap
and
trade
policies
ostensibly
designed
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
could
have
the
opposite
effect
says
the
National
Center
for
Public
Policy
Research's
Justin
Danhof
in
an
op-ed
published
today
by
the
Christian
Science
Monitor
That's
because
of
an
established
principle
of
behavioral
law
and
economics
explaining
that
when
a
stigmatized
behavior
is
turned
into
a
commodity
that
can
be
bought
and
sold
that
behavior
tends
to
lose
the
stigma
associated
with
it
Writing
in
the
Monitor
Justin
describes
a
social
science
experiment
in
which
parents
were
fined
if
they
arrived
late
to
pick
up
their
children
from
child
care
After
the
fine
was
imposed
the
number
of
parents
arriving
late
increased
because
guilt
associated
with
arriving
late
had
been
replaced
with
the
opportunity
to
buy
the
right
to
arrive
late
guilt-free
Parents
says
Justin
were
no
longer
arriving
late
but
rather
purchasing
extra
child-care
hours
Justin
continues
A
similar
situation
could
occur
under
a
cap-and-trade
regime
Under
cap-and-trade
rules
the
government
places
an
artificial
cap
on
the
amount
of
carbon
each
regulated
facility
may
emit
Facilities
producing
more
carbon
than
they
are
allowed
are
required
to
purchase
additional
credits
to
make
up
the
difference
The
opportunity
to
purchase
these
credits
creates
a
market
where
none
previously
existed
As
in
the
example
of
the
fined
parents
the
purchase
of
the
right
to
emit
greenhouse
gases
would
likely
reduce
any
stigma
associated
with
doing
so
Emission
levels
consequently
could
rise
Justin
says
there
are
real-world
examples
of
this
principle
at
play
in
the
global
warming
arena
Al
Gore
says
the
risk
of
catastrophic
global
warming
is
so
great
that
Americans
should
act
immediately
to
reduce
greenhouse-gas
emissions
Yet
his
home
uses
20
times
more
energy
than
the
average
American
home
according
to
the
Tennessee
Center
for
Policy
Research
That's
OK
the
former
vice
president
assures
us
because
he
purchases
offsets
to
ensure
that
he
lives
a
carbon-neutral
lifestyle
If
Mr
Gore
could
not
purchase
offsets
would
he
feel
more
pressure
to
reduce
his
energy
use
The
likely
answer
is
yes
The
article
goes
on
to
cite
works
by
Santa
Fe
Institute
researcher
Samuel
Boles
and
columnist
Charles
Krauthammer
and
to
review
the
results
of
Europe's
cap
and
trade
program
before
concluding
The
social
stigma
of
carbon
emissions
grows
stronger
each
day
As
this
stigma
grows
companies
are
increasing
their
investments
into
research
and
technologies
to
reduce
and
store
carbon
If
Congress
removes
the
stigma
associated
with
these
emissions
by
assigning
a
price
to
them
it
may
not
like
the
results

Strike
Back
In
an
op-ed
in
the
Charleston
Daily
Mail
Tuesday
David
Ridenour
writes
about
a
business
that
is
fighting
back
against
unfair
lawsuits
in
a
creative
way
West
Virginia
isn't
almost
Heaven
but
almost
Hell
where
its
judicial
climate
is
concerned
But
finally
there's
some
good
news
on
the
horizon
After
years
of
being
battered
by
the
state's
bizarre
system
of
jackpot
justice
sucker-punched
businesses
are
beginning
to
strike
back
In
late
May
the
West
Virginia
Supreme
Court
historically
a
good
friend
of
the
plaintiffs
bar
voted
5-0
to
deny
a
request
by
two
major
natural
gas
providers
Chesapeake
Energy
Corp
and
NiSource
to
hear
an
appeal
of
a
dubious
405
million
jury
verdict
that
found
the
companies
underpaid
landowners
At
issue
was
the
firms
practice
of
deducting
production
and
marketing
costs
from
the
royalties
they
paid
The
Roane
County
trial
court
inexplicably
found
that
leases
specifying
that
the
royalties
are
an
amount
one-eighth
of
the
price
net
all
costs
beyond
the
wellhead
and
less
taxes
assessments
and
adjustments
are
ambiguous
Ambiguous
or
not
the
court
interpreted
the
language
in
favor
of
the
owner
A
week
later
Chesapeake
Energy
countered
with
an
eye-opening
announcement
It
was
canceling
a
35
million
commitment
to
build
a
futuristic
regional
headquarters
on
the
outskirts
of
Charleston's
airport
Chesapeake
spokesman
Scott
Rotruck
tied
the
decision
directly
to
the
high
court's
denial
of
an
appeal
request
that
would
have
been
granted
pro
forma
in
most
states

Jackson's
Obama
Comments
Should
Fox
Have
Broadcast
Them
Matea
Gold's
Los
Angeles
Times
story
today
lets
readers
know
what
a
close
call
it
was
that
Jesse
Jackson's
off-color
comments
made
it
on
the
air
yesterday
But
for
an
alert
overnight
transcriber
Jackson's
comments
meant
to
be
private
almost
stayed
that
way
What
a
loss
to
the
public
interest
that
would
have
been
Not
I
suggest
that
the
public
benefited
very
little
from
knowing
Jackson's
personal
feelings
on
this
matter
and
that
Fox
was
doing
little
more
than
spreading
gossip
Revealing
all
isn't
always
useful
Take
the
rush
to
report
then-President
Reagan's
remark
meant
as
a
joke
that
the
bombing
of
the
Soviet
Union
begins
in
five
minutes
Like
Jackson's
comment
it
was
said
into
a
live
mic
but
it
wasn't
meant
to
be
public
What
if
the
Soviets
had
believed
Reagan
meant
it
The
satisfaction
a
few
reporters
received
by
covering
something
the
President
didn't
intend
to
be
public
would
have
been
faint
consolation
had
nuclear
warheads
rained
down
on
our
heads
Sure
Reagan
shouldn't
have
said
it
but
was
it
any
wiser
to
report
it
I'm
no
Jackson
fan
to
say
the
least
and
this
Jackson
issue
is
far
less
significant
than
the
Reagan
issue
but
I
think
broadcasting
Jackson's
private
comments
was
a
bit
rude
of
Fox
Jackson
was
a
guest
in
the
Fox
studio
he
said
something
that
obviously
was
not
meant
to
go
out
on
the
air
and
Fox
put
it
on
the
air
anyway
It
isn't
as
though
Jackson
is
running
for
office
himself
and
we
already
know
Jackson
has
an
inclination
toward
blunt
talk
Fox
told
us
nothing
new
and
nothing
important
If
Jackson
had
said
the
same
thing
by
the
sink
in
the
men's
room
and
a
Fox
employee
overheard
him
would
the
comment
still
be
fair
game
Does
a
live
mic
make
all
the
difference
Would
it
matter
if
Jackson
didn't
realize
his
was
on
or
that
it
was
sensitive
enough
to
pick
up
whispers
Are
there
any
rules
or
is
it
fair
for
journalists
to
print
anything
they
overhear
I
do
know
of
one
rule
the
journalists
put
on
themselves
The
big
media
outlets
mostly
don't
spy
on
their
own
personnel
or
one
another
We
can
be
sure
that
various
powerful
journalists
have
said
things
about
politicians
that
are
just
as
uncomplimentary
as
what
Jackson
said
but
the
journalists
comments
almost
never
get
reported
It's
not
because
they're
not
newsworthy
as
anything
revealing
the
biases
of
influential
journalists
would
be
newsworthy
It's
because
journalists
are
extending
a
courtesy
to
one
another
that
they
don't
feel
obliged
to
extend
to
people
who
chose
another
line
of
work
As
I
said
earlier
I'm
no
Jackson
fan
and
as
it
happens
I
generally
like
Fox
and
watch
it
often
But
I
don't
think
journalists
should
do
to
others
what
they
would
never
do
to
themselves

A
Segregation
Without
Perpetrator
or
Benefactor
A
new
New
Visions
Commentary
op-ed
by
National
Center
for
Public
Policy
Research
Research
Associate
Reece
Epstein
says
implementing
voter
ID
laws
can
benefit
the
poor
Reece
writes
in
part
Fighting
voter
ID
laws
rather
than
focusing
on
helping
people
comply
with
them
champions
a
disconnected
status
leading
to
further
disfranchisement
Not
only
might
people
not
be
able
to
vote
but
they
also
cannot
protect
and
grow
their
savings
travel
by
bus
train
or
air
wire
money
or
visit
government
buildings
Put
that
in
perspective
Denying
that
people
need
ID
in
our
modern
society
sounds
more
criminal
than
virtuous
Theirs
is
a
segregation
without
perpetrator
or
benefactor
but
it
is
segregation
nonetheless
Voter
ID
laws
don't
change
that
After
spending
lots
of
money
on
lawyers
lobbyists
and
grassroots
campaigns
to
keep
people
from
needing
ID
might
it
be
wiser
to
instead
spend
perhaps
a
fraction
of
that
money
on
a
non-profit
group
that
is
a
resource
to
help
those
without
ID
Instead
of
perpetuating
a
flawed
system
that
potentially
disfranchises
all
voters
why
not
provide
a
public
service
Don't
know
what
to
bring
or
where
to
get
an
ID
If
it's
not
on
the
web
site
someone
can
research
it
Having
trouble
getting
a
birth
certificate
Find
out
where
to
call
Need
cab
fare
or
money
to
purchase
an
ID
Fill
out
an
application
and
get
reimbursed
The
bottom
line
is
that
someone
without
proper
identification
is
out
of
step
And
those
who
want
to
keep
them
there
are
out
of
line

Congressman
Paul
Broun
Fights
for

Rights
A
note
on
the
fight
to
protect
property
rights
from
National
Center
for
Public

Research
Senior
Fellow
R.J
Smith
To
all
Once
again
freshman
Congressman
Paul
Broun
from
Georgia's
10th
is
on
the
House
floor
fighting
for
property
rights
Congress
has
been
sending
lots
of
bad
Green
Federal
land
grab
bills
to
the
floor
under
suspension
of
the
rules
allowing
no
amendments
and
very
limited
debate
and
trying
to
sneak
them
by
on
a
voice
vote
This
has
given
cover
to
a
surprising
number
of
GOP
members
including
supposed
conservatives
who
have
been
attempting
to
sneak
some
Green
earmarked
pork
to
their
districts
with
no
recorded
vote
Good
ol
Paul
Broun
is
down
there
making
certain
there
are
recorded
roll
call
votes
taken
The
strategy
Stop
the
bills
if
you
can
Make
people
think
twice
with
a
recorded
vote
Hold
the
RINOs
feet
to
the
fire
If
you
haven't
visited
Paul
Broun's
website
and
seen
his
Congressional
Property
Rights
Action
Caucus
and
the
weekly
e-letter
that
his
staffer
Stephen
Kraly
sends
out

On
Climate
A
Little
More
Washington
Post
Bias
I
believe
the
Washington
Post
knows
perfectly
well
that
the
word
censor
does
not
belong
in
the
lead
of
today's
Juliet
Eilperin
story
but
the
editors
left
it
in
or
inserted
it
anyway
The
story
Cheney
Aides
Altered
EPA
Testimony
Agency
Official
Says
Ex-Administrator
Says
Official
From
Vice
President's
Office
Edited
Out
Six
Pages
begins
Members
of
Vice
President
Cheney's
staff
censored
congressional
testimony
by
a
top
federal
official
on
the
health
threats
posed
by
global
warming
a
former
Environmental
Protection
Agency
official
said
today
Bush
and
Cheney
have
been
in
office
nearly
seven
and
a
half
years
now
That's
time
enough
for
the
Post's
staff
and
editors
to
get
used
to
the
fact
that
they
were
elected
to
run
the
executive
branch
and
thus
they
can
alter
any
executive
branch
document
presentation
or
policy
they
darn
well
please
That's
not
censorship
it's
editing
policy-setting
or
both
Business
as
usual
when
you
run
the
government
To
be
fair
near
the
end
of
the
story
Eilperin's
piece
included
this
quote
from
the
White
House
White
House
spokesman
Tony
Fratto
noted
that
White
House
officials
in
past
administrations
have
vetted
congressional
testimony
from
agency
officials
There's
absolutely
nothing
unusual
here
in
terms
of
the
interagency
review
process
whether
it's
testimony
rules
or
anything
else
Fratto
said
in
an
interview
The
process
exists
so
that
other
offices
and
departments
have
the
opportunity
to
comment
and
offer
their
views
There's
nothing
unusual
about
that
there's
nothing
nefarious
about
that
and
there's
nothing
different
here
from
previous
administrations
Exactly
right
In
other
words
the
whole
thing
is
a
non-story
Yet
the
Post
ran
it
anyway

In
Making
Hurricane
Predictions
NOAA
Aims
for
Broadside
of
a
Barn
With
the
news
today
of
the
formation
of
the
first
Atlantic
hurricane
of
the
2008
season
David
Ridenour
comments
on
NOAA's
2008
Atlantic
hurricane
forecast
NOAA
may
have
finally
figured
out
a
way
to
get
its
Atlantic
hurricane
forecast
right
It's
predicting
that
the
2008
season
which
began
June
1
will
be
either
normal
or
above
normal
Covering
two
out
of
three
possible
outcomes
ought
to
improve
NOAA's
odds
quite
a
bit
After
bungling
its
Atlantic
hurricane
forecasts
badly
both
last
year
and
in
2006
NOAA
is
no
doubt
anxious
to
avoid
being
embarrassed
for
the
third
year
in
a
row
Last
year
NOAA
forecast
seven-to-nine
hurricanes
17%-50
above
normal
but
there
were
just
six
hurricanes
the
number
NOAA
considers
normal
In
2006
the
agency
also
forecast
seven-to-nine
hurricanes
and
came
up
two
short
of
its
low-range
estimate
The
difference
in
the
way
NOAA
is
making
its
prediction
this
year
appears
especially
stark
when
you
compare
NOAA's
2007
and
2008
graphs
In
its
2007
hurricane-prediction
graph
NOAA
represented
normal
above
normal
and
below
normal
by
different
colors
click
image
to
see
full-size
The
2008
hurricane-prediction
graph
has
just
two
colors
green
for
both
near-normal
and
above-normal
and
light
blue
for
below
normal
click
image
to
see
full-size
Here's
how
NOAA
explains
it
in
its
press
release
The
Climate
Prediction
Center
outlook
calls
for
considerable
activity
with
a
65
percent
probability
of
an
above
normal
season
and
a
25
percent
probability
of
a
near
normal
season
This
means
there
is
a
90
percent
chance
of
a
near
or
above
normal
season
Funny
NOAA
personnel
didn't
do
it
that
way
last
year
Experts
at
the
NOAA
Climate
Prediction
Center
are
projecting
a
75
percent
chance
that
the
Atlantic
Hurricane
Season
will
be
above
normal
this
year
showing
the
ongoing
active
hurricane
era
remains
strong
At
the
time
they
were
forecasting
a
20
chance
of
near
normal
storm
activity
which
would
mean
a
95
chance
of
normal
or
above-normal
activity
Guess
the
5
swing
really
made
a
difference
If
one
doubts
that
NOAA
forecasters
might
be
hedging
their
bets
take
a
look
at
the
forecast
range
of
Accumulated
Cyclone
Energy
ACE
a
measure
of
total
storm
activity
that
takes
into
account
both
storm
intensity
and
duration
NOAA's
range
keeps
growing
This
year
NOAA
projected
the
ACE
will
be
between
100
and
210
of
the
median
With
a
median
value
of
87.5
that
translates
to
a
range
of
96.25
The
range
was
74.38
in
2007
65.62
in
2006
61.25
in
2005
52.5
in
2004
61.25
in
2003
and
35
in
2002
The
forecasts
failed
even
as
NOAA
was
increasing
the
margin
for
error
Perhaps
there's
a
legitimate
reason
why
the
ACE
forecast
range
keeps
growing
but
it
sure
looks
similar
to
someone
shooting
at
a
target
missing
then
moving
closer
to
target
to
make
it
a
bigger
target
You
miss
enough
times
and
get
close
enough
that
eventually
you
can't
miss
NOAA
won't
need
to
clear
a
very
high
bar
to
be
right
with
this
year's
hurricane
season
It
need
only
name
11
storms
which
ought
to
be
a
cinch
with
the
newly-updated
satellite
equipment
at
its
disposal
Eleven
is
an
average
number
of
named
storms
that
NOAA
says
occur
each
year
but
the
number
of
named
storms
has
risen
not
only
due
to
better
detection
due
to
advances
in
technology
but
due
to
changes
in
the
type
of
storms
that
are
named
Subtropical
storms
for
example
weren't
named
until
2002
Here's
hoping
Mother
Nature
has
a
sense
of
humor

Washington
Post
Other
Papers
Lose
27th
Amendment
to
the
Constitution
Nearly
two
years
ago
on
Newsbusters
I
floated
a
proposal
that
newspapers
require
their
editorial
and
other
writers
to
police
themselves
for
accuracy
by
requiring
them
to
turn
in
footnotes
with
their
copy
The
process
would
force
writers
to
check
information
they
think
they
know
that
isn't
so
Had
editors
at
the
Washington
Post
Hartford
Courant
Sacramento
Bee
and
Raleigh
News
Observer
taken
my
advice
they
could
have
prevented
a
howler
of
an
error
from
appearing
on
their
opinion
pages
this
week
in
which
a
writer
and
fact-checking
editors
at
all
four
papers
apparently
forgot
the
existence
of
the
27th
Amendment
to
the
U.S
Constitution
In
an
op-ed
titled
in
the
Washington
Post
version
Three
Cheers
for
July
2
writer
Andrew
Trees
writes
The
Bill
of
Rights
as
we
know
it
also
is
not
what
was
initially
proposed
The
original
first
two
amendments
one
of
which
concerned
the
number
of
constituents
each
member
of
Congress
had
and
one
regarding
congressmen's
salaries
were
never
ratified
by
the
states
Emphasis
added
What
we
think
of
today
as
our
First
Amendment
freedoms
were
actually
third
on
the
list
Mr
Trees
and
his
editors
apparently
have
never
heard
of
the
27th
Amendment
proposed
by
Congress
on
September
25
1789
as
the
second
of
Congress's
first
twelve
proposed
amendments
and
ratified
202
years
later
on
May
7
1992
when
Michigan
became
the
38th
state
to
ratify
it
The
amendment
for
those
who
may
be
curious
states
No
law
varying
the
compensation
for
the
services
of
the
Senators
and
Representatives
shall
take
effect
until
an
election
of
representatives
shall
have
intervened
The

has
an
extra
helping
of
egg
on
its
face
as
it
covered
the
lead
up

Had

his

before

might
very

have

it

that

him
I

don't

A
footnote
of
my
own
I
noticed
when
researching
this
post
that
when
the
first
Second
Amendment
was
ratified
on
May
7
1992
both
the
Washington
Post
and
New
York
Times
turned
to
law
professor
Walter
E
Dellinger
III
for
expert
opinion
On
May
8
1992
Richard
L
Berke
of
the
Times
quoted
Mr
Dellinger
saying
the
first
second
amendment
would
not
automatically
take
effect
because
it
had
simply
withered
and
died
after
it
failed
to
be
ratified
long
ago
Ten
days
later
U.S
Archivist
Don
W
Wilson
formally
certified
the
amendment
Mr
Dellinger
is
something
of
an
expert
on
the
second
Second
Amendment
too
He
argued
for
the
District
of
Columbia
in
the
just-decided
District
of
Columbia
v
Heller
gun-rights
case
telling
the
court
in
oral
arguments
that
the
Second
Amendment
is
expressly
about
the
security
of
the
State
No
luck
that
time
either

Drill
To
burst
the
oil
bubble
just
use
a
drill
says
David
Ridenour
in
an
op-ed
piece
at
least
two
dozen
newspapers
another
example
here
and
here
have
now
run
on
their
commentary
pages
A
version
of
the
piece
various
papers
have
edited
it
differently
follows
To
burst
the
oil
bubble
use
a
drill
If
Congress
stands
up
to
special
interests
and
develops
domestic
energy
sources
oil
prices
will
tumble
The
U.S
has
ample
oil
reserves
For
over
a
decade
environmentalists
have
prevented
drilling
for
oil
and
natural
gas
in
the
1002
Area
of
Alaska's
Arctic
National
Wildlife
Refuge
ANWR
an
area
in
the
refuge's
Northern
Coastal
Plain
set
aside
by
President
Carter
and
Congress
for
possible
oil
development
in
1980
At
1.5
million
acres
the
1002
Area
is
less
than
8
of
the
refuge
An
Energy
Information
Agency
estimates
the
amount
of
recoverable
oil
there
at
10.4
billion
barrels
President
Bill
Clinton
vetoed
a
bill
authorizing
drilling
in
ANWR
under
environmentalist
pressure
in
1995
Had
he
not
done
so
nearly
1.4
billion
barrels
of
oil
would
likely
be
flowing
from
ANWR
this
year
That's
equal
to
about
one-quarter
of
our
current
imports
Subsequent
efforts
to
open
as
little
as
2,000
acres
to
oil
and
gas
exploration
have
failed
repeatedly
but
Senator
Pete
Domenici
is
trying
again
this
year
If
you
think
oil
prices
are
inflated
just
get
a
load
of
environmentalists
claim
that
opening
2,000
acres
to
development
would
have
a
devastating
impact
on
ANWR
The
acreage
involved
is
just
0.01
of
ANWR's
total
The
U.S
also
has
enormous
oil
and
gas
reserves
in
the
Outer-Continental
Shelf
but
environmental
lobbyists
have
succeeded
in
keeping
these
resources
locked
away
too
There's
been
a
moratorium
on
offshore
drilling
since
1981
The
Department
of
Interior's
Minerals
Management
Service
estimates
that
areas
covered
by
the
moratorium
contain
nearly
19
billion
barrels
of
recoverable
oil
equal
to
about
four
years
of
U.S
oil
imports
But
don't
look
for
the
Outer-Continental
Shelf
to
be
opened
anytime
soon
A
U.S
House
Appropriations
subcommittee
rebuffed
an
effort
to
lift
the
27-year
moratorium
this
month
The
U.S
also
has
considerable
reserves
of
oil
shale
a
sedimentary
rock
that
produces
oil
when
heated
The
Bakken
Formation
located
in
North
Dakota
and
Montana
contains
between
3
and
4.3
billion
barrels
of
previously
undiscovered
recoverable
oil
while
the
Green
River
Formation
located
in
Wyoming
Utah
and
Colorado
contains
between
500
billion
and
1.1
trillion
barrels
of
recoverable
oil
The
midpoint
estimate
for
the
Green
River
Formation
alone
is
three
times
Saudi
Arabia's
known
reserves
Environmentalists
predictably
argue
that
increased
drilling
would
do
nothing
to
reduce
fuel
prices
Their
first
argument
is
that
it
will
take
a
decade
for
these
areas
to
produce
oil
But
while
production
may
be
years
away
the
decision
to
drill
will
immediately
burst
the
oil
bubble
created
by
investor
speculation
Speculation
has
contributed
significantly
to
the
price
of
oil
Mary
Novak
of
the
economic
forecasting
firm
Global
Insights
estimates
that
if
speculation
were
eliminated
a
barrel
of
oil
would
cost
just
75-$80
Why
do
many
investors
flock
to
oil
Because
two
American
reserves
are
going
in
opposite
directions
The
Federal
Reserve
has
produced
a
veritable
gusher
of
dollars
driving
down
the
dollar's
value
while
our
oil
reserves
are
kept
below
ground
keeping
oil
prices
high
As
long
as
investors
expect
demand
for
oil
to
grow
and
supplies
to
remain
the
same
or
shrink
they'll
continue
using
oil
as
a
hedge
against
the
devaluing
dollar
Drilling
would
change
all
that
The
greens
second
argument
is
that
OPEC
will
respond
to
our
domestic
oil
development
by
reducing
oil
output
keeping
prices
high
The
reality
is
that
sustained
high
prices
aren't
in
OPEC's
long-term
interest
as
it
provides
incentives
to
oil
development
projects
that
wouldn't
exist
otherwise
The
Rand
Corporation
estimates
crude
oil
prices
would
have
to
be
between
70
and
95
per
barrel
for
oil
development
in
Green
River
to
be
profitable
Once
developed
it
will
become
a
permanent
competitor
The
facts
are
clear
Developing
domestic
sources
of
oil
will
help
end
the
energy
crisis
And
with
two-thirds
of
Americans
now
in
favor
of
such
drilling
it's
time
to
act

He

David
Ridenour
writes
this
about
Army
sergeant
Matthis
Chiroux
a
six-day
Afghanistan
veteran
and
current
activist
with
Iraq
Veterans
Against
the
War
who
for
political
reasons
has
refused
an
order
to
be
recalled
to
active
duty
instead
calling
a
press
conference
to
denounce
the
war
in
Iraq
From
the
AFP
news
service
Matthis
Chiroux
is
the
kind
of
young
American
US
military
recruiters
love
I
was
from
a
poor
white
family
from
the
south
and
I
did
badly
in
school
the
now
24-year-old
told
AFP
I
was
filet
mignon
for
recruiters
They
started
phoning
me
when
I
was
in
10th
grade
or
around
16
years
old
he
added
Although
educational
standards
have
declined
somewhat
in
recent
years
due
to
the
increasing
demands
of
the
Iraq
conflict
the
U.S
Army
generally
tries
to
make
sure
90
percent
or
more
of
its
recruits
possess
at
least
a
high
school
diploma
As
late
as
2003
that's
the
year
the
Iraq
war
began
and
three
years
after
Mr
Chiroux
claims
to
have
been
relentlessly
pursued
by
recruiters
94
percent
of
new
Army
recruits
had
high
school
diplomas
or
more
advanced
degrees
You
don't
achieve
these
numbers
by
focusing
your
attention
on
poor
students
as
Chiroux
admits
to
have
been
Well
who
are
we
to
argue
with
him
He
says
the
Iraq
war
is
illegal
and
who
would
know
better
than
a
guy
who
did
badly
in
high
school
I
wonder
if
he
could
help
us
with
our
grammar
too
I
believe
him
when
he
says
he
was
filet
mignon
to
recruiters
however
Filet
mignon
means
dainty
filet
in
French
Sure
looks
like
one
dainty
filet

me

In
Kennedy
v
Louisiana
Court
Deaf
to
Child
Welfare
and
State
Sovereignty
Research
Associate
Reece
Epstein
takes
a
critical
look
at
the
Supreme
Court's
decision
in
Kennedy
v
Louisiana
On
May
2
1998
Patrick
Kennedy
raped
his
eight-year-old
daughter
Brutally
The
medical
examiner
discovered
A
laceration
to
the
left
wall
of
the
vagina
had
separated
her
cervix
from
the
back
of
her
vagina
causing
her
rectum
to
protrude
into
the
vaginal
structure
The
injuries
required
immediate
surgery
Kennedy
was
arrested
and
later
found
guilty
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
of
aggravated
rape
of
a
child
It
was
unanimously
determined
that
he
should
be
sentenced
to
death
in
accordance
with
Louisiana
State
law
But
today
in
its
ruling
in
the
case
of
Kennedy
v
Louisiana
the
U.S
Supreme
Court
held
The
Eighth
Amendment
bars
Louisiana
from
imposing
the
death
penalty
for
the
rape
of
a
child
where
the
crime
did
not
result
and
was
not
intended
to
result
in
the
child's
death
In
dissent
Justice
Alito
noted
This
is
so
according
to
the
Court
no
matter
how
young
the
child
no
matter
how
many
times
the
child
is
raped
no
matter
how
many
children
the
perpetrator
rapes
no
matter
how
sadistic
the
crime
no
matter
how
much
physical
or
psychological
trauma
is
inflicted
and
no
matter
how
heinous
the
perpetrator's
prior
criminal
record
may
be
The
majority
decision
written
by
Associate
Justice
Anthony
Kennedy
focused
on
a
supposed
national
consensus
against
capital
punishment
as
a
penalty
for
rape
Justice
Alito
however
noted
the
majority
ignored
that
in
just
the
past
few
years
five
States
have
enacted
targeted
capital
child
rape
laws
Those
laws
are
a
reaction
to
a
stunning
nationwide
rise
in
child
abuse
From
1976
to
1986
the
number
of
reported
cases
of
child
sexual
abuse
grew
from
6,000
to
120,000
By
1991
the
number
of
cases
totaled
432,000
In
1995
child
protection
services
agencies
identified
126,000
children
who
were
victims
Nearly
30
percent
of
those
child
victims
were
between
the
age
of
four
and
seven
Most
important
the
majority
argued
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
appropriate
in
the
case
of
child
rape
in
determining
whether
the
death
penalty
is
excessive
there
is
a
distinction
between
intentional
first-degree
murder
on
the
one
hand
and
nonhomicide
crimes
against
individual
persons
even
including
child
rape
on
the
other
As
an
aside
Justice
Kennedy
also
noted
Our
concern
here
is
limited
to
crimes
against
individual
persons
We
do
not
address
for
example
crimes
defining
and
punishing
treason
espionage
terrorism
and
drug
kingpin
activity
which
are
offensives
against
the
State
When
used
in
cases
of
offense
against
the
State
the
death
penalty
serves
to
reinforce
that
the
apparatus
of
government
is
more
than
a
mere
collection
of
laws
and
politicians
Rather
it
is
the
vanguard
of
our
freedom
and
rights
and
the
hand
of
justice
But
if
we
hold
the
State
sacrosanct
and
crimes
against
it
as
particularly
heinous
then
we
ought
to
afford
the
same
esteem
to
its
citizens
and
to
children
especially
Accordingly
Louisiana's
law
mandating
the
death
penalty
as
a
punishment
for
child
rape
was
just
It
reinforced
the
notion
of
right
and
wrong
and
recognized
the
dignity
of
both
criminal
and
victim
the
former
by
holding
him
ultimately
responsible
for
his
actions
and
the
latter
by
the
same
justice
In
Kennedy
v
Louisiana
a
majority
of
the
Court
showed
itself
to
be
deaf
to
America's
alarm
at
a
sharp
rise
in
child
abuse
and
disrespected
the
sovereignty
of
the
States
by
deciding
to
suspend
their
power
to
determine
how
injustice
ought
to
be
remedied

Court
Continues
Welcome
Trend
of
Reigning
in
Excessive
Punitive
Awards
From
Research
Associate
Justin
Danhof
comes
this
look
at
the
decision
in
Exxon
Shipping
Co
v
Baker
handed
down
June
25
In
1989
the
Exxon
Valdez
supertanker
grounded
on
a
reef
off
Alaska's
coast
spilling
millions
of
gallons
of
oil
Since
that
time
Exxon
has
spent
2.1
billion
in
clean-up
efforts
900
million
to
settle
a
civil
lawsuit
and
303
million
in
voluntary
payments
to
private
parties
Today
the
U.S
Supreme
Court
ruled
in
the
case
of
Exxon
Shipping
Co
v
Baker
that
that
is
enough
almost
The
Supreme
Court
did
rule
that
punitive
damages
are
allowed
under
maritime
law
In
a
5-3
decision
however
the
majority
directed
the
lower
court
to
reduce
the
punitive
award
from
2.5
billion
to
no
more
than
507.5
million
The
Court
took
a
commonsense
approach
by
aligning
punitive
damages
with
compensatory
damages
Associate
Justice
David
Souter
writing
for
the
majority
rejected
a
hard
cap
for
punitive
damages
and
instead
affixed
the
maximum
punitive
award
to
the
compensatory
award
a
one-to-one
ratio
Although
these
studies
were
not
dispositive
the
Court
cited
empirical
studies
showing
that
a
one-to-one
ratio
is
consistent
with
America's
average
punitive
award
The
decision
was
made
under
maritime
common
law
not
the
due
process
clause
under
which
most
punitive
challenges
are
brought
Justice
Souter
explained
t]oday's
enquiry
differs
from
due
process
review
because
the
case
arises
under
federal
maritime
jurisdiction
and
we
are
reviewing
a
jury
award
for
conformity
with
maritime
law
rather
than
the
outer
limit
allowed
by
due
process
Although
the
decision
did
not
set
direct
precedent
for
future
constitutional
claims
it
offered
guidance
to
lower
courts
and
was
instructive
of
the
Court's
position
towards
punitive
awards
generally
The
Court
was
mindful
that
punitive
awards
are
often
criticized
for
their
unpredictability
This
unpredictability
runs
counter
to
a
main
goal
of
punitive
awards
to
provide
an
example
The
Court
explained
that
a
penalty
should
be
reasonably
predictable
in
its
severity
so
that
even
Justice
Holmes's
bad
man
can
look
ahead
with
some
ability
to
know
what
the
stakes
are
when
choosing
one
course
of
action
or
another
This
decision
goes
a
long
way
towards
achieving
this
goal
The
Court's
decision
continues
a
welcome
trend
of
the
court
reigning
in
excessive
punitive
awards
In
State
Farm
v
Campbell
2003
the
Court
held
that
a
single-digit
maximum
i.e
no
greater
than
a
nine-to-one
punitive
to
compensatory
ratio
is
appropriate
in
all
but
the
most
exceptional
cases
Indeed
the
Exxon
decision
follows
State
Farm's
guidance
which
suggested
that
w]hen
compensatory
damages
are
substantial
then
a
lesser
ratio
perhaps
only
equal
to
compensatory
damages
can
reach
the
outermost
limit
of
the
due
process
guarantee
Justice
Souter's
majority
opinion
was
joined
by
Justices
Kennedy
Scalia
Thomas
and
Chief
Justice
Roberts
Justices
Breyer
Ginsberg
and
Stevens
dissented
arguing
that
the
Court
went
too
far
in
limiting
punitive
awards
Justice
Alito
a
holder
of
Exxon
stock
took
no

Excessive
punitive
awards
are
a
scourge
on
the
business
community
reducing
innovation

economic
growth
Today's
decision
sends
an
appropriate

that
companies
will

accountable

their
mistakes

not
bankrupt
by
untenable
punitive

Today's
U.S
Supreme
Court
ruling
guaranteeing
the
Constitution's
individual
right
to
own
firearms
and
overturning
the
ban
on
most
gun
ownership
in
the
nation's
capital
in
the
first
major
Second
Amendment
case
in
almost
70
years
is
being
hailed
by
black
activists
of
the
Project
21
leadership
network
Project
21
Fellow
Deneen
Borelli
says
the
decision
supporting
an
individual
right
to
use
firearms
is
a
loud
and
clear
declaration
that
the
government
cannot
pick
and
choose
what
constitutional
protections
are
honored
and
enforced
This
is
a
great
day
for
law-abiding
citizens
of
the
nation's
capital
who
have
unjustly
been
denied
their
full
right
to
protect
themselves
and
families
for
over
30
years
said
Borelli
The
Second
Amendment
guarantees
the
individual
right
of
citizens
to
arm
themselves
for
self-defense
and
not
become
easy
prey
Perhaps
the
government
should
find
a
better
way
to
keep
illegal
guns
away
from
criminals
and
not
law-abiding
citizens
The
case
of
District
of
Columbia
v
Heller
is
an
appeal
of
the
decision
of
the
U.S
Court
of
Appeals
for
the
DC
Circuit
in
Parker
v
District
of
Columbia
In
Parker
v
District
of
Columbia
the
DC
Circuit
ruled
the
District
of
Columbia's
Firearms
Control
Regulations
Act
of
1975
which
bars
handgun
ownership
by
most
D.C
residents
is
unconstitutional
The
specific
question
being
answered
in
District
of
Columbia
v
Heller
today
was
as
phrased
by
the
Court
Whether
provisions
in
the
District
of
Columbia
code
violate
the
Second
Amendment
rights
of
individuals
who
are
not
affiliated
with
any
state-regulated
militia
but
who
wish
to
keep
handguns
and
other
firearms
for
private
use
in
their
homes
The
District
of
Columbia
defending
the
constitutionality
of
the
firearm
ban
before
the
Court
in
oral
arguments
March
18
argued
the
Second
Amendment's
right
to
bear
arms
refers
not
to
an
individual
right
to
use
firearms
but
rather
to
a
right
to
participate
in
the
common
defense
and
a
restriction
of
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
to
interfere
with
the
arming
of
state
militias
The
District
of
Columbia
argued
to
the
Court
that
the
Second
Amendment
is
expressly
about
the
security
of
the
State
it's
about
well-regulated
militias
not
unregulated
individual
license
Opponents
of
the
ban
however
said
the
Founders
considered
self-defense
a
right
and
one
they
intended
the
Second
Amendment
to
protect
telling
the
Court
the
framers
knew
exactly
how
to
condition
a
right
on
militia
service
and
they
didn't
do
it
with
respect
to
the
Second
Amendment
There
are
countless
instances
in
which
individuals
are
on
their
own
when
it
comes
to
protecting
themselves
and
their
property
A
majority
of
the
Justices
recognized
this
and
upheld
the
Second
Amendment's
specific
protection
of
an
individual
right
to
self-defense
Now
that
D.C.'s
citizens
have
had
this
constitutional
right
restored
criminals
will
have
good
reason
to
think
twice
before
trying
to
plunder
another's
property
added
Project

Borelli
In
2007
in
a
newspaper
column
published
in
Philadelphia
Chicago
Pittsburgh
and
elsewhere
Borelli
addressed
some
of
the
public
policy
aspects
of
the
case
Besides
violating
the
Second
Amendment
D.C.'s
gun
ban
is
a
violation
of
the
fundamental
rationale
of
law
In
The
Law
noted
political
theorist
Frederic
Bastiat
wrote
It
is
evident
then
that
the
proper
purpose
of
law
is
to
use
the
power
of
its
collective
force
to
stop
this
fatal
tendency
to
plunder
instead
of
to
work
All
the
measures
of
the
law
should
protect
property
and
punish
plunder
D.C
promotes
the
opposite
effectively
protecting
the
plunderer
and
punishing
the
property
owner
Borelli
also
pointed
out
Research
shows
that
law-abiding
citizens
using
firearms
for
protection
can
save
lives
and
deter
crimes
In
Armed
New
Perspectives
on
Gun
Control
co-authors
Gary
Kleck
and
Don
Kates
note
that
as
many
as
2.5
million
victims
use
guns
to
defend
against
crime
each
year
and
handguns
are
actually
used
by
victims
to
repel
crime
far
more
often
than
they
are
by
criminals
in
committing
crimes
as
much
as
three
times
more
Borelli
believes
that
in
addition
to
it
being
unconstitutional
it
is
immoral
to
deny
law-abiding
citizens
the
right
to
legally
possess
a
firearm
especially
within
crime-infested
neighborhoods

Stephen
Colbert
for
Meet
the
Press
I
have
to
agree
with
columnist
Maggie
Gallagher
when
she
recommends
Steve
Colbert
for
the
Meet
the
Press
desk
chair
The
man
manages
to
get
to
the
heart
of
every
issue
Talking
about
issues
a
bit
more
and
handicapping
election
results
a
bit
less
would
be
refreshing
too
The
drive-by
media
would
be
appalled
but
the
suits
at
GE
would
love
the
ratings
Think
