Psychomancer
Yes
I'm
still
alive
and
yes
I
am
still
very
opinionated
Yet
again
the
american
public
body
disgusts
me
My
latest
gripe
is
all
this
conspiracy
crap
that
seems
to
be
spreading
in
regards
to
911
This
is
how
I
see
it
most
of
these
people
get
mad
at
you
for
just
believing
what
the
main
sources
of
media
tell
you
But
here
they
are
eating
up
what
some
joe
shmo
put
together
on
some
dvd
or
clips
on
youtube
along
with
his
own
web
site
with
edited
pics
of
blurry
footage
from
the
event
So
in
essence
they
are
no
better
than
we
are
they're
merely
looking
for
other
sources
of
information
to
eat
up
Neither
of
which
do
they
know
where
they
got
the
information
or
how
credible
they
are
If
you
want
some
actual
proof
with
cited
information
and
research
just
look
at
this
link
its
not
some
joe
shmo
with
some
know
how
about
html
and
an
opinion
making
claims
Popular
Mechanics
research
team
throws
all
the
misquoted
information
in
the
toilet

now

In
today's
paper's
opinion
section
I
noticed
that
one
of
the
cover
articles
was
by
a
man
who
goes
to
our
church
My
curiosity
was
piqued
and
I
started
reading
Basically
the
article
was
a
summary
of
twenty-five
years
of
action
for
and
against
the
continued
production
of
nuclear
weapons
specifically
it
was
about
the
twenty-five
year
history
of
a
local
anti-bomb
group
called
World
Citizens
for
Peace
I've
always
had
kind
of
mixed
feelings
about
nukes
on
the
one
hand
they're
a
valuable
asset
when
it
comes
to
bluffing
your
way
out
of
a
war
On
the
other
hand
they
can
wipe
out
civilization
as
we
know
it
Hmmmm...overall
I
think
I'm
inclined
against
their
use
but
I'm
not
terribly
educated
in
the
matter
In
any
case
I
learned
some
well
scary
stuff
from
this
article
that
I
wasn't
aware
of
before
For
one
thing
I
didn't
know
that
the
Bulletin
of
Atomic
Scientists
has
moved
the
Doomsday
Clock
from
seven
minutes
to
midnight
to
five
minutes
to
midnight
Creepy
Granted
I'm
assuming
all
those
fine
people
on
the
Bulletin
aren't
endowed
with
clairvoyant
powers
but
between
this
and
the
few
other
instances
I've
heard
about
them
and
the
Clock
I've
gotten
the
impression
that
they're
fairly
reliable
sources
on
the
subject
of
nuclear
science
Some
other
food
for
thought
could
be
found
in
a
paragraph
in
the
article
Today
there
are
still
more
than
25,000
nuclear
warheads
in
existence--12,000
of
them
are
deployed
and
3,500
are
on
hair-trigger
alert
ready
to
be
launched
in
a
matter
of
minutes
Today's
thermonuclear
weapons
hydrogen
bombs
make
the
Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki
atomic
bombs
seem
puny
It
takes
only
one
to
destroy
a
city
And
1
percent
of
the
world's
nuclear
arsenals
could
destroy
human
civilization
itself
Unfortunately
I
couldn't
find
the
article
online
to
give
a
link
to
it
but
perhaps
you
could
sniff
around
on
the
Tri-City
Herald's
website
if
you

Gregor
Samsa
gets
religion
james
About
a
month
before
school
got
out
give
or
take
a
week
we
were
reading
Gregor
Samsa's
The
Metamorphosis
in
Literature
class
At
one
point
I
and
various
members
of
my
family
were
having
one
of
those
random
discussions
about
Catholicism
and
I
made
an
interesting
connection
in
my
brain
between
Kafka
and
the
Church
or
more
accurately
a
connection
between
the
bug-man
Gregor
Samsa
and
the
Church
As
many
of
you
may
or
may
not
know
The
Metamorphosis
is
about
a
man
named
Gregor
Samsa
who
puts
up
with
the
unpleasant
job
of
traveling
salesman
supposedly
to
help
his
rather
ungrateful
family
pay
off
debts
His
existence
is
rather
humdrum
One
day
he
wakes
up
as
a
bug
Freaky
Anyway
as
the
days
then
weeks
then
months
pass
he
becomes
more
and
more
a
bug
less
and
less
a
human
and
more
and
more
distanced
from
his
family
He
loses
his
identity
to
his
bug-dom
And
as
many
of
you
may
or
may
not
know
about
forty
years
ago
a
council
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
called
Vatican
II
convened
and
put
into
effect
several
reforms
in
the
Church
For
example
it
was
decided
that
Mass
could
now
be
said
in
the
native
language
of
a
country
it
did
not
necessarily
have
to
be
Latin
Vatican
II
was
largely
intended
to
make
Catholicism
more
accesible
to
people
more
easily
understood
and
practiced
In
many
ways
this
has
helped
the
Church
a
lot
But
it
has
also
had
detrimental
effects
As
many
people
will
tell
you
the
sugar-coated
watered-down
let's-hold-hands-and-sing-Kumbayah
version
of
Catholicism
is
becoming
more
common
as
are
ignorant
Catholics
who
don't
appreciate
or
know
their
faith
because
their
true
faith
has
not
been
shown
to
them
For
example
liturgical
music
is
now
full
of
songs
that
make
people
happy
rather
than
turn
their
minds
and
hearts
to
God
Yes
Christianity
is
a
joyful
religion
and
happiness
is
good
particularly
in
say
a
recessional
or
entrance
hymn
But
when
that
happiness
is
manufactured
at
the
expense
of
awareness
of
God
and
really
isn't
happy
so
much
as
fluffy
you
have
a
problem
Another
example
Christian
artwork
such
as
that
featured
on
the
covers
of
hymnbooks
is
often
found
going
for
an
African-spiritual
sort
of
motif
that
doesn't
even
look
African
like
so
No
this
is
not
racism
I've
no
problem
with
real
African
artwork
what
bugs
me
is
when
it's
faked
for
a
non-artistic
purpose
namely
the
purpose
of
making
the
Church
appear
racially
diverse
and
ethnically
tolerant
And
again
I've
no
problem
with
racial
tolerance
but
we
should
not
make
advertising
it
a
priority
Third
example
in
gleaming
perfect
5-paragraph
essay
format
Architecture
I
know
there
have
been
beefs
about
this
before
We
have
all
I'm
sure
seen
those
churches
that
look
less
like
a
church
than
a
mothership
Or
as
a
more
recent
example
churches
that
look
like
some
sort
of
corporate
headquarters
In
these
cases
the
purpose
of
of
the
church
seems
to
be
to
make
a
statement
to
look
modern
and
hip
What
it
is
not
trying
to
do
is
turn
anyone's
faces
upwards
When
you
walk
into
a
space-age
church
you
are
less
likely
to
feel
God's
presence
than
you
are
to
think
So
this
is
what
a
geodesic
dome
looks
like
from
the
inside
Fascinating
isn't
it
Jeeves
In
the
effort
to
cultivate
a
sophisticated
modern
image
these
churches
are
losing
their
beauty
I
know
beauty
is
relative
but
how
many
people
are
truly
moved
by
looking
at
a
geodesic
dome
Or
a
coporate
headquarters
Here
are
some
examples
of
what
I'm
talking
about
So
where's
my
point
What
the
heck
does
Kafka
have
to
do
with
anything
It
occured
to
me
a
while
ago
that
The
Metamorphosis
could
serve
as
a
metaphor
for
these
things
I've
been
describing
though
it
certainly
wasn't
intended
as
such
Gregor
Samsa
thinking
he's
doing
his
family
a
favor
reluctantly
slogs
through
an
unpleasant
job
as
a
traveling
salesman
In
doing
so
however
he
gets
lost
literally
in
his
boredom
and
frustration
with
life
He
loses
his
identity
and
his
humanity
and
turns
into
a
bug
Similarly
various
factions
of
the
Church
have
been
attempting
to
make
themselves
more
accesible
more
attuned
to
the
culture
more
hip
etc
They
hide
those
aspects
of
Catholicism
that
they
think
people
won't
like
or
will
get
bored
with
But
as
a
result
of
making
themselves
more
accesible
they
are
losing
their
identity
the
identity
of
Catholicism
They
are
losing
the
inherent
mystery
beauty
and
counter-cultural
persistence
that
make
the
Church
the
Church
How
do
we
fix
this
Keep
in
mind
the
true
ideal
of
the
Church
It
is
an
ideal
contained
in
the
Apostle's
Creed
the
Catechism
and
above
all
the
words
of
Jesus
It's
reverence
coupled
with
joy
not
joy
compromisng
reverence
or
vice-versa
It's
beauty
coupled
with
simplicity
It's
an
ability
to
identify
with
people
not
to
be
more
accesible
to
them
The
truth
will
set
you
free
especially
that
of
religion
which
must
never
ever
be
hidden
in
an
attempt
to
make
it
more
attractive
But
what
about
those
people
for
whom
such
great
measures
have
been
taken
to
make
the
Church
more
attractive
We
have
to
bring
things
down
to
their
level
how
else
will
they
possibly
be
saved
notice
the
built-in
derision
of
that
statement
It's
pretty
simple
really
They're
big
boys
and
girls
The
Church
doesn't
have
to
come
down
to
them
They
can
rise
up
to
the
Church
Basically
all
us
Catholics
should
just
follow
the
advice
of
all
those
wise
mentor
figures
in
all
those
Disney
movies
Just
be
yourself

Music
sucks
Brian
Am
I
the
only
one
who
thinks
music
sucks
That
is
recent
music
ranging
from
rap
R&B
which
almost
always
sucks
hip-hop
metal
rock
and
alternative
music
seem
to
be
in
an
awkward
stage
And
by
awkward
I
mean
that
everything
sounds
exactly
the
same
Back
in
the
early
the
mid
90s
we
had
Rage
Against
the
Machines
Pantera
Nirvana
Pearl
Jam
Eminem
Tupac
U2
Red
Hot
Chili
Peppers
and
an
assortment
of
other
artists
who
seemed
push
music
forward
setting
the
groundwork
for
recent
artists
In
the
late
90s
and
early
00s
new
and
innovative
bands
began
to
emerge
such
as
Linkin
Park
and
System
of
a
Down
Up
until
2004
music
seemed
be
in
an
exciting
stage
in
which
anything
was
possible
Countless
bands
were
combining
different
genres
together
old
obnoxious
genres
were
diminishing
and
everyone
seemed
to
have
a
definite
goal
in
mind
Blah
Now
it's
as
if
recent
bands
have
run
out
of
their
creative
juices
Everything
sounds
exactly
the
same
and
besides
the
same
bands
I've
been
listening
to
for
the
past
5
1/2
years
I
can't
seem
to
find
anything
I
can
officially
LOVE
Every
two
weeks
new
cookie-cutter
artists
emerge
doing
absolutely
nothing
new
or
interesting
for
their
genres
To
their
credit
however
they
don't
pretend
to
do
anything
new
or
interesting
They
seem
to
take
comfort
in
their
blatant
mediocrity
claiming
to
sound
just
like
the
innovative
bands
that
preceded
them
To
prove
my
point
I
will
now
list
a
number
of
well
known
bands
that
are
practically
indistinguishable
from
each
other
most
of
them
are
metal/hardcore
As
I
Lay
Dying
Oh
how
dramatic
As
I
Lay
Dying
Mind
finishing
the
sentence
retards
Okay
so
you're
dying...NOW
WHAT
I
admit
I'm
a
sucker
for
double
and
in
some
cases
triple
bass
and
pinch-harmonics
but
for
Odin's
sake
why
DO
THEY
HAVE
TO
SOUND
LIKE
EVERY
OTHER
HARDCORE
BAND
IN
EXISTANCE
All
Shall
Perish
Okay
so
their
name
borders
on
badass
but
haven't
I
heard
their
sound
somewhere
before
Oh
yeah
that's
right
AS
I
LAY
DYING
Don't
get
me
wrong
I
totally
dig
the
guitar
but
still
it
lacks
variety
If
you
want
some
awesome
guitar
see
AVENGED
SEVENFOLD
Drop
Dead
Gorgeous
Wow
I
never
knew
what
an
important
role
the
comma
played
in
communication
I
mean
for
a
second
there
I
thought
they
were
making
some
vague
reference
to
their
astonishingly
good
looks
Guess
not
In
short
they
do
nothing
interesting
and
the
vocals
are
reminiscent
of
a
dying
child
All
That
Remains
Yay
Another
incomplete
sentence
Anyway
at
least
2
of
their
songs
feature
some
pretty
sick
guitar
solos
and
their
vocals
although
screamy
aren't
intolerable
Unfortunately
there
are
a
number
of
more
experienced
bands
that
do
the
exact
same
thing
better
Still
Remains
What's
up
with
the
whole
remainder
theme
Remains
of
what
My
guess
is
that
they're
referring
to
the
few
remaining
fans
they
have
after
everyone
else
figured
out
they
sounded
like
a
cross
between
Senses
Fail
and
All
That
Remains
Anyway
my
original
idea
was
to
list
as
many
bands
as
I
possibly
could
Unfortunately
I
don't
have
the
patience
to
list
any
other
ones
so
the
current
one
will
have
to
do
YAY
For
the
record
go
to
myspace.com's
music
section
and
you'll
find
a
million
other
bands
that
sound
like
the
ones
listed
above
JUST
DO
IT
It's
rewarding

My
Face
Brian
I
enjoy
reading
people
or
at
least
trying
to
read
people
I'm
not
that
good
at
detecting
motives
but
I
can
spot
subtle
facial
expressions
and
hand
gestures
that
give
clues
to
the
person's
emotional
state
Thus
far
I
can
almost
always
tell
when
someone's
lying
there
are
exceptions
of
course
One
method
I
use
to
tell
if
someone's
lying
is
to
study
their
face
the
split
second
before
they
lie
Usually
their
eyes
give
it
away
completely
they
avert
their
gaze
as
their
eyes
begin
to
quickly
scan
around
as
if
they
were
frantically
running
a
search
in
their
mind
to
locate
the
best
and
most
efficient
lie
Words
work
well
too
of
course
However
some
people
have
excellent
control
over
the
tone
of
their
voice
as
well
as
which
words
they
choose
I'm
getting
good
at
this
Therefore
words
aren't
the
best
way
of
reading
people
Anyway
I
found
this
fascinating
article
about
facial
expressions
and
how
to
read
them
You
should
check
it
out
It's
a
bit
lengthy
but
some
of
the
material
is
absolutely
incredible
P.S
Here's
a
tip
for
all
you
frequent
amateur
liars
Stop
sucking
at
lying
jeez
It's
no
fun
reading
people
who

Yesterday
I

the

some

BEST
MOVIE
EVER
Okay
so
it
certainly
wasn't
the
best
movie
ever
but
it
was
definitely
the
manliest
Seriously
this
whole
movie
was
powered
solely
by
testosterone
It
was
awesome
So
here's
a
very
brief
review
Review
Key
Plot
overall
premise
Awesomeness
explosions
blood
manliness
Eye
Candy
special
effects
babes
etc
Lingering
Impressions
frame
of
mind
after
seeing
film
PLOT
Big
guys
with
big
weapons
fighting
big
enemies
If
that
isn't
enough
incentive
to
see
the
movie
then
I
don't
want
else
to
tell
you
Basically
the
entire
movie
is
loosely
based
off
the
Battle
of
Thermopylae
However
I've
been
told
it's
very
accurate
to
Frank
Miller's
graphic
novel
if
that
makes
any
difference
My
point
is
that
this
movie
will
thoroughly
piss
off
ANY
historian
who
happens
to
see
it
out
of
curiosity
Basically
everything
in
this
movie
is
completely
OVER-THE-TOP
That
means
10,000
Spartans
are
10,000,000
Spartans
the
Persians
are
portrayed
as
sub-human
orc-beings
and
everybody
contains
20x
more
quarts
of
blood
than
in
reality
Those
of
you
who
see
movies
for
the
gasp
plot
should
be
forewarned
The
overall
premise
of
this
movie
is
painfully
simple
If
you're
like
me
and
don't
particularly
take
any
interest
in
how
complex
and
coherent
a
plot
is
300
shouldn't
bother
you
at
all
Awesomeness
First
off
everyone
in
this
movie
is
ripped
not
excluding
women
and
children
The
Spartans
are
rockin
12-pack
abs
red
capes
loincloths
and
pikes
No
300
doesn't
contain
any
homoerotic
overtones
on
the
contrary
their
uber-masculinity
was
intended
to
emphasize
how
powerful
and
glorious
the
Spartans
were
in
contrast
to
their
effeminate
adversaries
In
regards
to
sheer
unadulterated
awesomeness
this
movie
takes
the
cake
Watching
thousands
of
arrows
cast
a
shadow
on
300
men
prior
to
pelting
their
shields
is
just
plain
awesome
To
give
you
better
feel
for
how
awesome
this
movie
was
picture
this
A
40-foot
wall
consisting
entirely
of
Persian
corpses
literally
topples
over
and
smashes
a
handful
of
ninjas
Yes
it's
that
awesome
Oh
and
by
the
way
there
are
explosions
Eye
Candy
Yes
300
is
pure
eye
candy
This
movie
offers
an
amazing
visual
experience
superior
to
LOTR
The
dim
grainy
visual
style
of
the
movie
never
gets
old
and
gives
300
a
unique
personality
In
addition
to
the
unique
visual
style
the
camera
effects
were
impressive
The
battle
scenes
transitioned
from
slow-mo
to
normal-motion
seamlessly
Although
gory
300's
violence
is
highly
stylized
and
isn't
realistic
in
the
least
bit
To
my
surprise
the
entire
movie
was
filmed
in
front
of
a
bluescreen
With
the
exception
of
a
few
obviously
computer-generated
beasts
the
movie
didn't
go
overboard
on
the
CGI
and
everything
looked
very
realistic
It
also
has
babes
and
about
2-minutes
of
nudity
for
those
of
you
who
honestly
care
Lingering
Impressions
After
walking
out
of
the
theater
I
felt
like
squeezing
out
a
couple
dozen
pushups
and
a
couple
hundred
situps
I
also
felt
like
brutally
bludgeoning
a
few
Persians
or
anyone
else
who
was
in
close
proximity
to
me
but
I
don't
feel
the
need
to
elaborate
on
that
All
in
all
I'd
gladly
see
the
movie
again
It's
the
type
of
movie
you
definitely
want
to
see
on
the
Big
Screen
for
sure
Following
the
movie
I've
been
entertaining
thoughts
on
what
it
would
be
like
if
America
was
as
militaristic
as
ancient
Sparta
was
Awesome
Also
I
just
now
realized
that
the
majority
of
the
movie
was
filmed
in
slow-motion
which
probably
accounts
for
its
length
Anyway
I
give
this
movie
a
20
out
of
10
No
I'm
not
mathematically
challenged
this
movie
just
rocked

A
Cure
for
Low
Self-Esteem
Brian
Believe
it
or
not
I'm
not
always
the
overly-confident
narcissist
you
see
before
you
today
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
often
find
myself
spiraling
uncontrollably
towards
depression
As
a
result
of
depression
I'm
frequently
unwilling
to
engage
in
any
creative
or
productive
activities
thus
rendering
myself
completely
useless
Of
course
this
eventually
leads
to
periodic
sessions
of
low
self-esteem
Up
until
now
I
haven't
found
a
way
to
efficiently
conjure
up
my
confidence
or
creativity
while
in
a
depressed
state
besides
tripping
children
Well
thanks
to
YouTube
things
have
changed
Usually
when
I
experience
low
self-esteem
I
tell
myself
I
suck
at
my
various
hobbies
more
specifically
guitar
I've
been
playing
since
Christmas
and
I'm
not
that
bad
honestly
However
depression
does
strange
things
to
your
mind
earlier
today
I
told
myself
I
was
the
worst
guitar
player
in
the
world
I
was
almost
convinced
until
I
saw
these
YouTube
vids
1
The
art
of
thrash
guitar
I
admit
I
was
fooled
by
the
title
I
had
the
impression
it
was
going
to
be
a
step-by-step
approach
to
harnessing
the
demonic
powers
of
THRASH
Unfortunately
it
turned
out
to
be
a
half-ass
attempt
at
mimicking
the
basic
style
of
thrash
guitar
Frankly
this
guy
sucks
His
alternate-picking
is
weak
and
slow
and
his
riffs
were
lacking
the
percussive
vibe
thrash
metal
is
known
for
Just
recently
I
tuned
my
guitar
down
to
Drop
D
enabling
me
to
thrash
like
I've
never
thrashed
before
Just
watching
this
kid's
pathetic
attempts
to
emulate
one
the
evilest
styles
of
guitar
ever
conceived
inflates
my
ego
2
Drop
D
Fun
Judging
by
the
title
of
this
submission
one
would
assume
it
would
be...well
fun
to
watch
Nothing
could
have
been
farther
from
the
truth
This
vid
was
painful
to
watch
Near
the
beginning
of
his
song
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
something
going
His
little
power-chord
pattern
was
almost
catchy
Unfortunately
for
my
ears
he
decided
he
would
try
to
improvise
and
ended
up
ruining
everything
It's
almost
as
if
he
was
trying
to
suck
It's
also
worth
noting
he
messed
up
some
of
his
power
chords
which
is
almost
impossible
to
do
when
you're
playing
in
drop

Metal
Riffage
Oh
boy
mom
METAL
RIFFAGE
Before
I
begin
my
critique
of
this
disaster
let
me
explain
what
metal
riffage
implies
1
A
heavy
chunky
sound
lacking
recognizable
melody
2
A
sinister
feeling
characterized
by
randomly
executed
arpeggios
and
clunky
power-chords
and
3
manic
speed
Unsurprisingly
this
video
doesn't
meet
any
of
the
criteria
for
being
metal
First
of
all
there
weren't
any
randomly
execute
arpeggios
that
is
most
of
his
notes
were
slowly
played
on
the
5th
and
6th
strings
Secondly
it
lacked
the
dark
wicked
edge
that
metal
is
typically
known
for
Additionally
it
just
didn't
freakin
sound
good
It
reminded
me
of
a
50-car
pileup
which
is
awesome
to
see
but
not
so
awesome
to
hear
If
executed
properly
metal
is
reminiscent
of
a
giant
robot
wading
through
molasses
Either
that
or
a
speeding
runaway
bullet
train...armed
with
nuclear
weapons
Now
that's
awesome
I
know
what
you're
thinking
BRIAN
IF
UR
SO
GOOD
WHY
DONT
U
DEMINSTRATE
HOW
TO
PLAY
INSTEAD
OF
REDICULING
OTHERS
Well
if
I
had
a
digital
camcorder
I'd
be
more
than
willing
to
share
the
love
Unfortunately
I
don't
so
you're
going
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
I
know
what
I'm
talking
about
Now
that
I'm
a
rigid
narcissist
again
I
can
safely
say
YouTube
is
a
great
way
to
eradicate
any
form
of
low-self
esteem

Joe
Dear
Google
I
first
came
to
blogger
at
the
tail
end
of
2003
I
appreciated
its
design
ease
of
use
and
advanced
capabilities
Then
you
bought
it
Although
the
newer
interface
was
delightful
you
set
the
groundwork
for
what
eventually
became
this
new
failure
When
Blogger
in
Beta
first
came
out
I
was
about
as
excited
as
a
part-time
blogger
could
be
I
thought
y'all
were
breaking
some
new
ground
and
I
could
be
on
the
cutting-edge
of
new
blogging
technologies
I
couldn't
have
been
more
wrong
You
people
added
junk
that
Wordpress
has
had
for
forever
You
turned
the
nice
PHP/HTML
hybrid
into
a
mess
of
some
strange
dialect
of
XML
Not
only
did
you
turn
us
off
by
with
the
code
we
had
come
to
appreciate
you
then
simplified
the
whole
shootin
match
into
a
few
basic
tools
that
are
hellish
in
their
rigidity
I
don't
know
what
the
sam
hill
you
nerds
were
smoking
when
you
came
up
with
this
crap
but
it's
not
appreciated
Furthermore
your
minions
attack
microsoft
for
the
same
things
that
your
corporation
does
with
no
scruples
I
call
to
mind
your
stupid
purchase
of
YouTube
just
so
that
you
could
remove
competition
THAT
is
monopolistic
and
is
reprehensible
Also
your
premium
editions
of
tools
that
you
want
to
push
is
horrible
At
the
very
least
don't
screw
microsoft
over
when
they
do
the
same
thing

Google
Brian
I
just
spent
a
good
5
minutes
of
my
precious
life
trying
to
sign
into
my
OLD
blogger
account
only
to
find
that
Google/Blogger
is
FORCING
me
to
upgrade
Blog
Hogger
to
their
new
dysfunctional
Blogger
account
What
does
this
mean
Allow
me
to
elaborate
Blogger's
new
settings
include
the
following
new
and
unimproved
features
Barely
decipherable
template
code
They
replaced
the
old
Blogger
tags
the
foundational
code
of
your
blog
with
some
new
garbage
that's
impossible
to
figure
out
A
cluttered
dashboard
basically
the
page
that
allows
you
manage
your
various
blogs
By
the
time
I
figured
out
how
to
navigate
Blogger's
new
dashboard
my
eyes
were
bleeding
profusely
Unoriginal
elements
such
as
category
options
Basically
Blogger
completely
ripped
off
Wordpress.com's
unique
category
system
Way
to
go
fudge-packers
you're
almost
as
unoriginal
as
Microsoft
Seriously
though
have
you
seen
Microsoft's
new
IE
They
stole
ALL
those
features
directly
from
FireFox
Blah
I'm
honestly
not
as
frustrated
as
I
sound
I
just
enjoy
exaggerating
my
feelings
and
opinions
However
I'm
still
a

peeved
at
Blogger's
complete
disregard
for
MY
feelings
How

they

how

you
take

in

The
game
allows
you
to
explore
a
beautiful

jungle-like
environment
along
with
some
major
cities
scattered
here
and
there
Just

that
is
skydiving
from

leaping
from

A
Dream
Come
True
Brian
So
I
finally
set
aside
some
time
to
just
sit
down
and
discover
what
exactly
podcasting
is
I
hear
people
referring
to
podcasts
all
the
time
but
I
never
really
looked
into
it
I
had
a
basic
understanding
of
it
but
very
little
interest
in
it...until
now
Like
I've
mentioned
before
on
Blog
Hogger
I've
always
had
a
dream
of
hosting
a
talk
show
Up
until
now
I
hadn't
been
able
to
find
a
practical
means
of
broadcasting
one
Podcasting
seems
like
a
legitimate
solution
So
while
expanding
my
knowledge
of
podcasting
I
stumbled
upon
http://BlogTalkRadio.com
Check
this
out
Supposedly
this
website
allows
users
to
host
their
own
personal
online
talk
show
via
the
telephone
It
also
enables
you
to
feature
guests
friends
family
celebs
good
luck
with
that
one
homes
on
your
show
That's
awesome
My
only
disappointment
is
that
I
wasn't
creator
of
that
website
In
other
words
I
came
up
with
that
concept
long
before
BlogTalkRadio.com
emerged
and
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
actually
invented
it
first
Oh
well
I
digress
Anyway
I'm
definitely
going
to
look
into
this
more
I'll
keep
you
updated
on
my
talk
show

I'm
ADHD
Positive
Brian
I
just
got
done
taking
this
ADHD
test
My
results
were...well
let's
just
say
I
wasn't
too
surprised
I
scored
a
total
of
19
ADHD
points
which
means
I'm
2
points
above
the
minimum
score
for
being
ADHD
positive
Whoop
Of
course
this
is
just
an
online
test
and
there's
very
little
reason
why
you
should
take
it
completely
seriously
But
still
OMG
it's
not
raining
anymore
Gotta
go
play
basketball
Later
Update
I
just
found
a
longer
ADD/ADHD
quiz
My
score
said
I
was
moderately
ADHD
