sold
sister
on
eBay

Both
JayBird
and
Helen
covered
this
story
in
their
unique
way
Here's
JayBird's
take
to
be
followed
by
Helen's
James
Blunt
tells
GQ
that
he
once
sold
his
sister
on
eBay
And
not
in
that
funny
joking
way
he
really
did
sell
her
Apparently
he's
not
quite
as
big
a
jerk
as
this
makes
him
sound
I
was
waiting
for
my
first
album
to
come
out
and
ended
up
selling
pretty
much
everything
I
owned
on
eBay
I
had
a
mild
addiction
Anyway
I
came
back
to
the
flat
where
my
sister
was
staying
and
she
was
crying
because
she
couldn't
get
to
a
funeral
in
Ireland
The
planes
were
on
strike
the
ferry
was
out
of
season
and
there
were
no
trains
I
ended
up
whacking
it
on
eBay
Damsel
in
distress
seeks
knight
in
shining
armour
Desperate
to
get
to
a
funeral
in
Southern
Ireland
please
help
From
London
Net
While
this
makes
him
sound
a
little
off
kilter
who
in
the
world
wants
to
go
to
a
funeral
with
someone
you've
never
met
That
your
brother
found
on
eBay
And
paid
for
you
it's
sweet
in
a
weird
way
Turns
out
the
guy
who
won
James
Blunt's
sister
was
wealthy
enough
not
just
to
buy
her
but
also
had
his
own
helicopter
that
choppered
them
to
the
funeral
God
I
hope
they
didn't
land
it
next
to
the
church
or
something
Anyway
it
turns
out
that
the
pair
fell
in
love
and
they're
getting
married
this
summer
So
in
a
way
Blunt's
eBay
addiction
helped
his
sister
find
true
love
Or
buy
true
love
Whichever
Who
says
brothers
don't
look
out
for
you
Helen's
take
James
Blunt
Pimp
James
Blunt
may
be
the
ultimate
sensitive
crooner
but
doesn't
seem
to
quite
make
it
to
that
level
of
sensitivity
behind
the
music
He
sold
his
sister
to
the
highest
bidder
on
eBay
This
is
really
hard
to
explain
so
here's
what
he
had
to
say
about
it
The
stupidest
thing
I've
ever
sold
is
my
sister
on
eBay
I
was
waiting
for
my
first
album
to
come
out
and
ended
up
selling
pretty
much
everything
I
owned
on
eBay
I
had
a
mild
addiction
Anyway
I
came
back
to
the
flat
where
my
sister
was
staying
and
she
was
crying
because
she
couldn't
get
to
a
funeral
in
Ireland
The
planes
were
on
strike
the
ferry
was
out
of
season
and
there
were
no
trains
I
ended
up
whacking
it
on
eBay
Damsel
in
distress
seeks
knight
in
shining
armour
Desperate
to
get
to
a
funeral
in
Southern
Ireland
please
help
The
bids
flooded
in
and
the
guy
who
won
had
a
helicopter
He
flew
her
to
the
funeral
That
was
three
years
ago
this
summer
they're
getting
married
From
NZ
Herald
This
is
probably
a
story
I
would
have
kept
to
myself
Probably
for
the
same
reason
James
kept
it
to
himself
until
now
he
knows
it's
not
really
part
of
the
sexy
singer-songwriter
mantle
to
sell
your
relatives
no
matter
how
good
the
cause
I
wonder
what
the
final
bid
was
At
least
she
liked
the
guy
how
awkward
would
it
be
to
be
stuck
with
someone
you
couldn't
tolerate
in
a
helicopter
when
he
had
paid
for
the
privilege
James
Blunt's
music
doesn't
appeal
to
me
at
all
but
I've
always
kind
of
liked
him
after
seeing
this
on
Australian
television
a
year
ago
ANDREW
DENTON
That
song
you
just
sang
Goodbye
My
Lover
was
for
you
on
the
album
the
most
important
song
That
was
the
one
about
the
girl
who
was
the
one
Have
you
sung
her
out
of
your
system
JAMES
BLUNT
I've
sung
it
a
lot
No
it
hasn't
got
me
the
girl
back
but
I'm
sure
it
will
get
me
laid
I
wonder
how
many
times
it
got
him
laid
No
no
I
don't
Just
keep
on
being
miserable
James
it
seems
to
work
for
you

Charlotte
Church
throws
fiance
out
Posted

Published

Nov
Pregnant
Charlotte
Church
21
has
thrown
her
fianc
Gavin
Henson
out
of
their
home
after
discovering
that
he's
been
cheating
on
her
The
classically
trained
singer
and
television
host
wasn't
going
to
stand
for
that
kind
of
treatment
Henson
a
rugby
player
broke
Charlotte's
heart
by
cheating
on
her
with
Tracy
Donnelly
a
shop
assistant
in
Belfast
The
two
met
at
a
nightclub
called
Thompson's
Garage
after
one
of
Henson's
matches
Church
obviously
isn't
any
condition
to
go
drinking
at
clubs
but
apparently
that
hasn't
held
Henson
back
from
making
sure
he
still
has
a
good
time
Tracy
alleges
Gavin
invited
her
back
to
the
La
Mon
Hotel
and
Country
Club
on
the
outskirts
of
Belfast
where
they
exchanged
kisses
under
a
table
in
the
banqueting
suite
It
was
a
drunken
snog
or
two
or
three
says
Tracy
Nothing
for
Charlotte
to
worry
about
I
mean
come
on
who
doesn't
get
up
to
these
cheeky
little
things
When
we
left
each
other
I
didn't
take
his
number
but
he
took
mine
Needless
to
say
I
never
heard
from
him
again
From
Now
Magazine
If
my
boyfriend
drunkenly
kissed
a
girl
and
then
invited
her
back
to
a
hotel
he'd
be
looking
at
the
business
end
of
a
hissy
fit
The
People
UK
referred
to
Church
as
Notoriously-jealous
Charlotte
Right
because
only
notoriously
jealous
people
would
have
a
problem
with
their
boyfriends
kissing
other
girls
How
could
someone
who's
just
a
little
bit
famous
or
even
dating
someone
who's
just
a
little
bit
famous
think
that
they
wouldn't
be
caught
I
mean
this
girl
ran
to
the
press
about
it
right
away
how
could
you
expect
anything
less
This
Tracy
Donnelly
sure
has
a
high
opinion
of
herself
despite
her
behavior
Some
of
her
best
quotes
from
her
interview
Every
woman
in
the
place
was
swarming
around
him
but
I
stayed
well
clear
About
midnight
he
came
over
and
said
These
girls
are
really
annoying
me
They
just
want
to
talk
to
me
because
I'm
famous
When
we
snogged
it
was
exciting
but
I
think
he
knew
that
he'd
done
something
wrong
But
it
happened
all
the
same
again
and
again
and
again
There
was
never
a
question
of
sex
I
don't
know
if
it
crossed
his
mind
or
not
but
I'm
not
that
kinda
girl
People
may
think
that
my
speaking
out
will
ruin
Gavin
and
Charlotte's
relationship
but
I
doubt
it
It
was
a
drunken
snog
or
two
Who
doesn't
do
it
Although
I
guess
he
should
be
more
careful
From
The
People
UK
Well
I
guess
she
was
wrong
when
she
said
that
she
doubts
what
she
did
will
ruin
Charlotte's
relationship
How
could
someone
do
that
to
another
girl
let
alone
someone
who
is
pregnant
That's
just
so
far
beyond
the
line
According
to
Hollyscoop
Charlotte
has
now
locked
Gavin
out
of
their
home
refusing
to
listen
to
his
apologies
and
excuses
Charlotte's
mother
has
been
calling
Henson
and
screaming
at
him
Good
for
her
Apparently
the
guy
has
a
history
of
drunken
flirting
which
probably
explains
Charlotte's
notorious
jealousy
with
good
reason
There's
no
point
in
staying
with
someone
that
flirts
and/or
cheats
every
time
they
have
a
drink
She's
21
which
is
not
an
incredibly
mature
age
but
it's
not
like
she's
a
desperate
teenager
either
She
has
the
resources
to
take
care
of
herself
and
her
baby
and
she
should
do
just
that
and
forget
about
this
loser

Is
Jennifer
Aniston
moving
to
the
U.K
Posted
By
TechniCool
Published
in
Jennifer
Aniston
9
Nov
Even
though
Jennifer
Aniston
had
supposedly
broken
up
with
model
Paul
Sculfor
sources
are
saying
that
the
two
are
still
together
and
Jennifer
is
actually
considering
moving
to
England
with
him
to
aid
his
homesickness
The
Friends
star
is
claimed
to
be
happy
with
a
move
across
the
Atlantic
to
aid
her
homesick
boyfriend
A
source
commented
Jennifer
loves
the
UK
and
London
especially
now
that
with
her
relationship
with
Paul
she
has
a
reason
to
be
there
Paul
has
been
missing
home
and
Jennifer
is
tired
of
Los
Angeles
so
it
seems
only
logical
they
give
it
a
go
They
added
Paul
has
a
place
in
the
UK
but
they
plan
to
look
for
something
together
in
London
soon
From
Digital
Spy
Somehow
I
don't
think
Jennifer
is
stupid
enough
to
do
that
just
yet
She
seems
uber
if
not
over
bonded
with
best
friend
Courtney
Cox
and
apparently
has
a
pretty
tight
circle
of
friends
in
Los
Angeles
The
article
also
claims
that
Aniston
and
Sculfor
never
broke
up
and
that
Sculfor
actually
just
went
home
to
London
for
two
weeks
This
woman
has
a
history
of
picking
men
that
don't
want
to
commit
to
her
She
was
engaged
to
Tate
Donovan
married
for
five
years
only
to
be
left
for
Angelina
Jolie
though
of
course
Brad
refutes
that
then
spent
how
many
years
clowning
around
with
Vince
Vaughn
who
everyone
knew
she
was
too
good
for
and
he
still
wouldn't
commit
to
her
Sometimes
you
just
look
at
someone
and
can
see
they're
empty
and
Paul
Sculfor
is
one
of
those
guys
Maybe
it's
the
vacant
model
stare
but
there's
just
a
lack
of
substance
there
I
hope
she
finds
someone
decent
who
treats
her
well
Actually
I
still
hope
she
finds
Ross
but
I'm
a
loser
that
way

Victoria
Beckham
Claims
A
Boob
Size
Of
32B
Posted
By
TechniCool
Published
in
Victoria
Beckham
9
Nov
At
last
weeks
reunion
event
Victoria
Beckham
was
the
hands
down
winner
of
stealing
the
spotlight
from
the
rest
of
the
Spice
Girls
Wasn't
incredibly
difficult
Emma
Bunton
is
in
the
third
trimester
of
her
pregnancy
Geri
Halliwell
dresses
like
my
mother
and
Melanie
Brown
just
looks
way
different
from
her
Mel
B
for
my
tastes
And
why
were
the
eyes
planted
on
Victoria
The
corset
spill-over
of
Frankenboobs
of
course
According
to
today's
Sun
Daily
the
star
reckons
she
doesn't
know
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
Victoria
told
The
Sun
Daily's
Bizarre
Everyone
keeps
going
on
about
my
t**s
but
they're
only
a
32B
I'm
not
a
plastic
surgeon
nor
am
I
a
woman
but
I
can
guarantee
you
that
those
are
not
32Bs
What
we
are
seeing
is
the
result
of
when
a
relatively
large
implant
is
used
over
little
soft
tissue
cover
They
just
look
really
fake
It's
a
look
that
some
prefer
I
suppose
until
you
have
to
touch
one
I
won't
bore
you
with
my
preferences
however
getting
hit
in
the
chest
by
two
rocks
isn't
one
of
them
I'm
curious
if
anyone
else
out
there
really
believes
Vic
Do
you
think
she
has
32Bs
and
a
great
bra
is
doing
all
the
work
Inquiring
minds
what
to
know

I
really
enjoy
these
Jude
Law
drunk
pictures
This
is
the
second
time
Jude
Law
has
been
photographed
out
looking
tipsy
recently
and
the
last
set
came
out
just
two
weeks
ago
He
was
leaving
the
Cabaret
club
in
London
last
night
and
you
can
see
the
serious
look
on
his
face
as
he
tries
to
concentrate
on
walking
At
least
someone
else
is
driving
him
home
Jude
Law
recently
threw
his
ex
wife
and
mother
of
his
four
children
Sadie
Frost
a
42nd
birthday
party
with
a
cake
that
said
Sexy

He
is
said
to
be
planning
a
safari
vacation
with
her

their

He
also
resisted
the

of
his

a

Scarlett
Johansson
with
a
mystery
guy
Posted
By

Published

Scarlett
Johansson
9
Nov
Is
it
wrong
that
these
pictures
of
Scarlett
Johansson
looking
like
she's
gained
weight
made
me
feel
better
about
myself
At
least
she's
dressing
totally
normal
unlike
say
a
very
fallen
pop
star
who
always
dresses
like
a
fug
slut
that
we're
not
talking
about
this
week
She
also
looks
normal
and
I'm
not
saying
she's
pudgy
or
fat
or
anything
just
that
she's
not
super
thin
and
that's
nice
to
see
She
was
seen
out
in
Manhattan
on
6/29
with
a
mystery
blonde
guy
Her
nose
ring
is
kind
of
unattractive
but
it's
not
like
it's
new
I
remember
seeing
it
last
year
Those
rings
that
hang
from
the
middle
of
the
nose
aren't
as
flattering
as
the
normal
one-nostril
ones
Scarlett
will
star
in
yet
another
film
by
director
Woody
Allen
called
Barcelona
It
is
set
in
Barcelona
Spain
and
starts
shooting
next
week
It
also
features
Penelope
Cruz
Patricia
Clarkson
Kevin
Dunn
and
Chris
Messina

Articles
in
this
week's
Star
Magazine
and
the
National
Enquirer
say
a
new
book
about
JFK's
children
American
Legacy
The
Story
of
John
Caroline
Kennedy
by
C
David
Heymann
claims
that
JFK
Jr
was
taking
narcotics
for
an
ankle
injury
and
that
those
drugs
coupled
with
the
fact
that
he
was
drinking
on
the
night
he
crashed
his
plane
would
have
impaired
his
ability
to
fly
It
also
contains
the
bombshell
that
Kennedy
flew
into
the
path
of
an
American
Airlines
flight
before
his
plane
crashed
The
book
which
relies
on
eyewitness
accounts
and
never-before
released
government
documents
reveals
that
Kennedy
strayed
into
the
flight
path
of
American
Airlines
Flight
1484
carrying
128
passengers
and
six
crew
members
shortly
before
his
fatal
crash
Control
tower
personnel
could
not
contact
Kennedy
by
radio
because
he
was
not
responding
At
the
last
minute
the
American
flight
swerved
to
avert
a
mid-air
collision
Heymann
writes
that
Kennedy
was
taking
Vicodin
a
narcotic
he
had
been
prescribed
for
pain
from
surgery
on
an
ankle
he
broke
while
para-gliding
on
June
1
a
month
and
a
half
before
his
fatal
accident
At
a
service
station
near
the
airport
before
his
flight
Kennedy
was
spotted
by
executive
and
pilot
Roy
Stoppard
who
noticed
Kennedy
was
carrying
an
opened
bottle
of
white
wine
From
The
National
Enquirer
print
edition
July
9th
2007
The
NTSB
report
concluded
that
Kennedy's
crash
was
the
result
of
pilot
error
Kennedy
was
said
to
have
misjudged
the
altitude
as
there
were
hazy
conditions
with
no
visual
reference
overcorrected
and
sent
his
high-performance
plane
into
a
spin
which
probably
knocked
him
unconscious
Back
when
JFK
Jr
crashed
his
plane
I
was
dating
a
guy
who
was
taking
private
pilot
lessons
at
Caldwell
airport
in
NJ
where
JFK
Jr
his
wife
Caroline
Bessette
and
her
sister
Lauren
set
off
on
that
fateful
night
Anyway
I
e-mailed
him
for
his
take
on
this
story
as
I
know
he
followed
it
closely
at
the
time
and
since
he's
a
pilot
he
has
more
insight
into
it
than
I
do
Here's
how
he
explains
the
NTSB
report
When
you
fly
in
blackout
conditions
dark
night
no
moon
fog
you
have
absolutely
no
reference
to
the
horizon
except
for
your
HSI
horizontal
situation
indicator
Your
inner
ear
measures
acceleration
so
if
you
say
turn
around
to
talk
to
your
sister-in-law
and
then
turn
back
front
you
could
feel
like
the
plane
has
changed
attitude
even
when
it
hasn't
Something
like
that
probably
happened
with
JFK
He
felt
the
plane
was
in
an
ascending
turn
or
flying
level
when
really
he
had
put
it
into
a
descending
turn
At
some
point
he
saw
the
HSI
and
altimeter
and
not
realizing
his
descending
turn
had
already
gotten
the
plane
close
to
its
never-exceed
speed
VNE
he
overcorrected
and
hammerheaded
which
probably
knocked
him
unconscious
At
this
point
the
plane
stalled
rolled
on
its
back
and
headed
straight
into
the
Atlantic
E-mailed
from
my
friend
DB
In
the
Star
Magazine
article
about
the
upcoming
book
it
is
said
that
author
Heymann
claims
that
he
had
a
secret
autopsy
performed
on
Kennedy's
remains
and
that
they
showed
he
had
three
times
the
legal
limit
of
booze
in
his
system
His
tissue
and
lungs
had
a
very
high
level
of
alcohol
I
sent
the
report
to
toxicologists
who
say
he
had
three
times
the
legal
limit
in
his
system
My
friend
DB
points
out
that
more
experienced
pilots
than
JFK
Jr
decided
not
to
fly
that
night
due
to
low
visibility
He
may
have
been
drunk
but
there
are
many
other
factors
that
could
explain
his
tragic
plane
crash

Shane

supposed
11

ER
cutie
Shane
West
has
been
the
subject
of
gay
rumors
since
he
arrived
at
a
party
in
March
with
actor
Ashton
Holmes
Anonymous
tips
to
Queerty
had
him
making
out
at
two
different
parties
with
a
guy
that
fit
Holmes
description
I'm
not
attempting
to
out
the
guy
and
I
personally
don't
believe
that
anyone
should
do
that
intentionally
as
that's
someone's
personal
business
and
can
affect
an
actor's
career
There's
a
difference
between
reporting
on
a
story
and
maliciously
going
after
someone
I
know
to
me
it
doesn't
matter
and
I
always
thought
people
may
as
well
come
out
Crazy
Days
and
Nights
has
a
good
post
about
how
it
can
ruin
an
actor/actresses
chance
to
play
straight
characters
which
made
me
reconsider
Anyway
there's
a
questionable
article
in
the
National
Enquirer
this
week
about
Shane
West's
supposed
11
year
affair
with
a
porn
star
who
says
she
broke
it
off
with
him
when
he
wanted
threesomes
with
other
women
If
that
doesn't
say
he's
a
red-blooded
straight
guy
what
does
Of
course
it's
filled
with
enthusiastic
quotes
from
the
buxom
brunette
about
how
into
sex
he
is
The
tone
of
the
article
is
so
over
the
top
that
it
sounds
comical
ER
star
Shane
West
has
had
a
secret
11-year-affair
with
a
porn
star
The
Enquirer
has
learned
exclusively
Shane
loves
sex
maybe
too
much
says
31-year-old
Dorian
Grant
The
two
broke
up
earlier
this
year
because
Dorian
says
Shane
wanted
her
to
bring
other
women
into
the
bedroom
Our
relationship
ended
because
he
couldn't
get
his
way
and
have
a
threesome
says
Dorian
who
has
starred
in
such
movies
as
Jiggly
Queens
2
Busty
Blondes
in
Heat
6
and
Beautiful
Bosom's
Bound
We
began
seeing
each
other
but
I
quickly
realized
he
was
only
interested
in
using
my
talents
and
didn't
want
to
take
me
out
on
regular
dates
said
Dorian
Shane
treated
me
like
a
porn
star
all
of
the
time
and
that
made
me
angry
Shane
would
visit
her
at
her
home
strictly
for
sex
she
says
and
she
finally
became
fed
up
with
being
his
booty
call
Most
of
the
time
he
couldn't
even
wait
to
get
to
the
bedroom
she
said
Shane
wanted
to
do
it
everywhere
on
the
floor
the
couch
of
a
table
it
didn't
matter
to
him
At
first
I
thought
he
was
just
turned
on
by
me
or
really
liked
me
but
the
moment
he
was
finished
he
was
out
the
door
From
The
National
Enquirer
print
edition
July
9
2007
Isn't
that
a
great
stage
name
Dorian
Grant
The
fact
that
it's
a
reference
to
an
Oscar
Wilde
novel
about
debauchery
makes
the
whole
story
seem
that
much
more
credible
Grant
is
a
real
porn
star
link
is
to
IMDB
and
is
safe
for
work
who
has
gone
by
that
name
for
some
time
but
whether
this
story
is
true
or
not
is
up
to
question
and
she
probably
could
use
the
publicity
Maybe
that's
just
how
porn
stars
talk
Shane's
publicist
says
he's
never
had
a
relationship
with
Grant
but
she
supposedly
passed
a
lie
detector
test
according
to
The
Enquirer
According
to
Wikipedia
West
has
been
linked
with
Rachael
Leigh
Cook
Monica
Keena
Marla
Sokoloff
Dina
Meyer
Jenna
Dewan
and
singer

Sheffield
