I

I
know
I've
lost

I'll
be
working

to
renew

Down
and
Dirty
Yes
it's
been
a
month
since
I
blogged
I've
been
watching
each
day
as
the
events
leading
up
to
this
election
have
blossomed
into
the
major
FUBAR
situation
that
is
bound
to
happen
next
tuesday
with
some
dismay
and
also
some
resignation
It's
been
a
long
drawn
out
election
for
me
as
a
government
teacher
because
I've
had
my
students
examining
the
Oregon
ballot
and
voting
themselves
while
also
learning
about
the
electoral
process
both
nationally
and
locally
The
one
issue
added
to
the
curriculum
this
year
is
the
electronic
voting
They've
read
Robert
Kennedy's
article
in
Rolling
Stone
and
they've
watched
several
NOW
episodes
about
voting
machines
Lou
Dobbs
also
did
a
great
segment
of
CNN's
Broken
Government
series
on
the
voting
machines
What's
scaring
me
is
Karl
Rove's
continued
insistence
that
he
knows
stuff
the
rest
of
us
don't
know
is
that
to
make
Republicans
look
good
in
the
face
of
increasing
opposition
or
does
he
truly
know
some
nefarious
information
and
is
setting
the
public
up
to
feed
us
a
bunch
of
crock
when
the
election
gets
fixed
The
polls
are
looking
pretty
amazing
but
this
year
2006
I
refuse
to
hope
I've
hoped
before
I
am
going
to
remain
a
neutral
observer
and
see
what
happens
Of
course
that's
actually
a
lie...I'm
going
to
hope
no
matter
what
I
always
do
I'm
a
progressive
I'm
all
about
hope

Clean
House
It
just
get
worse
Here
in
Oregon
the
law
states
that
if
you
know
of
any
abuse
towards
children
or
minors
and
you
fail
to
report
it
you
are
criminally
liable
just
like
the
abuser
I
don't
know
what
the
law
is
in
DC
but
frankly
nothing
less
than
sweeping
criminal
indictments
for
any
lawmaker
who
knew
Mark
Foley
was
a
predator
and
did
nothing
should
be
accepted
Yesterday
word
was
that
the
Republican
leadership
has
known
of
his
abusive
behavior
for
years
and
yet
kept
it
quiet
They
enabled
his
predatory
habits
and
are
just
as
guilty
of
the
abuse
themselves
It's
just
further
indication
of
the
Culture
of
Bullies
that
control
the
government
these
days
The
behavior
is
chronic
in
the
entire
leadership
of
Washington
in
all
three
branches
It's
disgusting
and
it
shows
these
people
for
the
inhuman
beings
they
are
Unfortunately
if
the
media
latches
on
to
this
new
scandal
I
fear
that
what
will
be
lost
is
discussion
of
that
horrible
bill
that
was
passed
on
Thursday
The
shifting
of
power
to
the
executive
branch
in
that
bill
is
so
beyond
unconstitutional
The
removal
of
habeas
corpus
the
acceptance
of
torture
the
denial
of
the
Geneva
treaty
we
signed
in
good
faith
all
those
things
are
part
of
the
entire
package
that
now
gives
the
Executive
so
much
authority
that
the
Congress
has
virtually
made
itself
redundant
It
is
what
Thomas
Jefferson
feared
the
return
of
a
king
And
now
that
we
know
this
king's
minions
also
alow
the
abuse
of
children
to
take
place
in
the
halls
of
Congress
we
can
be
further
assured
that
no
good
can
come
of
this
Not
that
we
ever
thought
it
could
Now
more
than
ever
it
is
crucial
to
shift
power
in
November
If
only
to
try
to
rebalance
the
branches
of
government
just
a
little
Though
after
the
display
on
Thursday
I
have
no
more
faith
in
Democratic
leadership
than
I
do
in
the
Republican
at
this
point
But
some
sort
of
shift
must
occur
or
the
consolidation
of
power
will
go
completely
unchecked

is
not
good

Fools
on
the
Hill
I
have
been
trying
to
consider
how
to
teach
my
government
class
about
what
is
happening
today
in
the
Senate
I've
set
CSPAN
to
tape
the
debates
I've
printed
out
various
news
reports
I've
even
tried
to
read
that
whole
damned
bill
We're
only
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester
they've
only
just
learned
what
happened
during
the
Constitutional
Convention
the
compromises
that
were
made
Some
of
them
horrible
And
now
in
real
life
time
a
compromise
is
being
made
that
is
taking
away
some
of
the
very
foundational
concepts
of
our
democracy
Of
course
I'll
have
to
teach
them
what
habeas
corpus
is
and
then
explain
that
it's
been
part
of
the
philosophy
of
the
Consent
by
the
governed
since
the
Magna
Carta
Removing
the
power
of
a
king
to
imprison
you
without
having
to
say
why
is
something
that
has
stood
the
test
of
time
since
the
FOURTEENTH
CENTURY
The
fact
that
we
have
given
so
much
power
to
the
executive
effectively
negates
the
balance
of
powers
that
our
Constitution
was
founded
on
The
fact
that
our
leaders
could
even
DEBATE
whether
we
should
entomb
torture
as
an
acceptable
and
non-prosecutable
practice
shows
how
far
down
the
slope
we
have
slidden
from
that
ideal
the
Framers
of
the
Constitution
envisioned
John
Adams
wanted
a
powerful
presidency
he
sought
to
locate
more
power
in
the
hands
of
the
executive
and
he
fought
a
battle
with
Thomas
Jefferson
over
that
concept
He
introduced
the
Alien
and
Sedition
Acts
he
didn't
like
all
the
criticism
he
was
getting
especially
about
consolidating
his
power
and
so
he
got
the
Congress
to
make
it
illegal
to
say
anything
against
the
government
meaning
him
It
ended
badly
for
all
the
legislators
who
had
voted
for
this
clearly
unconstitutional
idea
Abraham
Lincoln
suspended
Habeas
Corpus
during
the
Civil
War
the
one
thing
he
said
he
regretted
doing
The
one
thing
he
has
been
very
criticized
for
in
a
presidency
of
many
hard
choices
He
shouldn't
have
done
it
It
would
not
have
threatened
the
union
though
he
let
fear
rule
the
day
Franklin
Roosevelt
suspended
Habeas
Corpus
during
WWII
when
he
allowed
Japanese
Americans
to
be
interned
without
charges
for
indefinite
periods
of
time
A
dark
stain
on
America's
history
when
we
once
again
allowed
fear
to
rule
the
day
All
three
beloved
presidents
yet
all
three
stepped
over
the
line
With
bad
consequences
But
not
irreparable
the
country
recovered
and
did
its
best
to
repair
the
damage
I
feel
in
my
heart
the
Constitution
is
stronger
than
these
horrid
Fools
on
the
Hill
and
that
it
will
prevail
But
only
if
it
has
someone
to
defend
it
left
in
the
government
With
the
passing
of
this
bill
today
it
becomes
more
clear
that
this
defense
is
dying
a
slow
death
at
best
The
Republicans
think
the
passage
of
this
bill
will
ensure
their
hold
on
power
They
are
trading
their
souls
for
it
And
there
are
Democrats
who
have
now
done
the
same
Will
Americans
allow
their
souls
to
be
sold
as
well
Thomas
Jefferson
must
be
doing
double
flips
in
his
grave
right
now
What
happened
to
that
glorious
republic
he
and
the
others
worked
so
hard
to
build
Flawed
and
damaged
though
it
was
started
on
some
unholy
premises
the
3/5
Compromise
being
the
worst
but
altogether
a
simple
and
completely
solid
supreme
law
of
the
land
the
Constitution
has
survived
217
years
because
of
its
strengths
and
its
ability
to
be
amended
for
the
better
This
109th
Congress
these
Fools
on
the
Hill
now
think
they
can
strip
our
democracy
of
its
foundations
If
the
Democrats
cannot
win
in
November
they
don't
deserve
to
If
they
cannot
stand
up
for
a
simple
concept
like
habeas
corpus
or
stand
against
a
horrifying
idea
like
institutionalized
torture
then
do
we
really
want
them
to
win
Rock
and
a
hard
place
And
that
rock
has
hit
the
slippery
slope
and
is
gaining
speed
If
even
executive
tyranny
can't
be
stopped
by
butting
up
against
the
Constitution
then
the
only
thing
left
is
the
power
of
the
citizenry

Consent

Governed

Stunning
There
was
a
speech
far
more
meaningful
and
thoughtful
and
true
than
the
President's
speech
last
night
I
thought
that
Keith
Olberman's
soliloquy
about
Rumsfeld
last
week
was
amazing
as
did
most
everyone
and
it
boggled
my
mind
that
he
could
keep
his
job
afer
that
But
LAST
NIGHT
I
watched
the
conclusion
of
Countdown
with
my
jaw
dropped
completely
open
If
you
didn't
see
it
WATCH
IT
it's
called
This
Hole
in
the
Ground
I'm
hoping
like
his
Rumsfeld
comments
this
commentary
will
be
all
over
the
airwaves
this
week
It
was
incredible
He
told
the
truth
Why
is
that
so
incredible
Because
until
now
I
have
heard
no
news
person
no
commentator
no
media
personality
whatsoever
actually
question
the
President's
veracity
or
speak
the
truth
about
the
squandered
5
years
since
9/11
Olbermann
put
the
onus
purely
where
it
belongs
On
George
W
Bush
Speaking
about
the
footprint
of
the
World
Trade
Center
Towers
Keith
Olbermann
Five
years
later
Mr
Bush
we
are
still
fighting
the
terrorists
on
these
streets
And
look
carefully
sir
on
these
16
empty
acres
The
terrorists
are
clearly
still
winning
And
in
a
crime
against
every
victim
here
and
every
patriotic
sentiment
you
mouthed
but
did
not
enact
you
have
done
nothing
about
it
And
there
is
something
worse
still
than
this
vast
gaping
hole
in
this
city
and
in
the
fabric
of
our
nation
There
is
its
symbolism
of
the
promise
unfulfilled
the
urgent
oath
reduced
to
lazy
execution
The
only
positive
on
9/11
and
the
days
and
weeks
that
so
slowly
and
painfully
followed
it
was
the
unanimous
humanity
here
and
throughout
the
country
The
government
the
President
in
particular
was
given
every
possible
measure
of
support
Those
who
did
not
belong
to
his
party
tabled
that
Those
who
doubted
the
mechanics
of
his
election
ignored
that
Those
who
wondered
of
his
qualifications
forgot
that
History
teaches
us
that
nearly
unanimous
support
of
a
government
cannot
be
taken
away
from
that
government
by
its
critics
It
can
only
be
squandered
by
those
who
use
it
not
to
heal
a
nation's
wounds
but
to
take
political
advantage
Terrorists
did
not
come
and
steal
our
newly-regained
sense
of
being
American
first
and
political
fiftieth
Nor
did
the
Democrats
Nor
did
the
media
Nor
did
the
people
The
President
and
those
around
him
did
that
They
promised
bi-partisanship
and
then
showed
that
to
them
bi-partisanship
meant
that
their
party
would
rule
and
the
rest
would
have
to
follow
or
be
branded
with
ever-escalating
hysteria
as
morally
or
intellectually
confused
as
appeasers
as
those
who
in
the
Vice
President's
words
yesterday
validate
the
strategy
of
the
terrorists
They
promised
protection
and
then
showed
that
to
them
protection
meant
going
to
war
against
a
despot
whose
hand
they
had
once
shaken
a
despot
who
we
now
learn
from
our
own
Senate
Intelligence
Committee
hated
al-Qaida
as
much
as
we
did
The
polite
phrase
for
how
so
many
of
us
were
duped
into
supporting
a
war
on
the
false
premise
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
9/11
is
lying
by
implication
The
impolite
phrase
is
impeachable
offense
Enough
Said
Thank
you
Mr
Olbermann

Back
To
School...Again
Before
this
week
starts
and
we
get
caught
up
in
the
5
Year
Anniversary
I
thought
I'd
take
a
few
minutes
to
enjoy
the
pure
delight
that
fills
my
soul
every
time
this
year
This
last
week
was
the
first
week
the
students
came
back
What
a
rush
I
can't
help
it
I
love
teenagers
The
writhing
masses
of
ferociously
self-centered
puberty-driven
half-awake
human
beings
that
cross
my
threshold
every
year
just
thrill
me
It's
the
greatest
feeling
to
see
them
sitting
there
their
hooded
eyes
after
all
most
aren't
even
awake
till
sometime
near
noon
just
daring
me
to
teach
them
something
new
I
love
a
challenge
what
can
I
say
Some
new
things
this
year
1
Not
one
of
the
sophomores
15/16
yr
olds
believes
that
Saddam
Hussein
had
anything
to
do
with
9/11
To
a
kid
they
also
recognize
that
the
reason
for
invading
Iraq
weapons
of
mass
destruction
turned
out
to
be
false
So
either
they
had
very
frank
discussions
with
their
teachers
last
year
or
the
truth
is
finally
seeping
through
to
the
public
at
large
I
usually
find
that
kids
just
repeat
what
they
hear
at
home
In
my
district
that
is
often
a
conservative
very
narrow
view
So
it's
really
surprising
to
find
such
an
overwhelming
number
who
actually
are
aware
of
the
truth
from
the
start
2
Already
all
my
seniors
who
are
of
age
are
ALREADY
registered
to
vote
in
the
upcoming
election
Wow
Some
old
things
Coming
into
the
class
the
kids
feel
powerless
about
what's
happening
in
the
world
But
this
is
the
way
I
like
it
By
the
time
they
leave
my
class
they
have
knowledge
and
tools
to
go
into
the
world
with
power
That's
what
I
love
about
teenagers
once
they
get
a
taste
of
making
change
in
the
world
you
can't
stop
them
It's
a
heady
thing
This
is
going
to
be
a
great
year
I
have
a
classroom
this
year
I
no
longer
have
to
run
from
classroom
to
classroom
with
a
cart
and
I
love
the

Weird
is
as
Weird
Does
There
was
a
great
column
in
the
Oregonian
this
Sunday
How
Weird
Are
We
It's
about
how
we
Portlanders
pride
ourselves
on
our
unique
weirdness
but
is
our
weirdness
really
all
that
original
Now
this
may
seem
to
be
a
trivial
question
amidst
all
the
heavy
issues
that
face
us
these
days
But
the
column
brought
up
a
good
point
Time
was
every
place
was
weird
using
the
less-common
dictionary
definition
of
strange
or
extraordinary
character
Unique
in
other
words
Back
in
the
day
every
city
was
weird
there
were
weird
streets
and
weird
neighborhoods
and
weird
businesses
serving
weird
people
You
know
kind
of
like
Alaska
It
was
a
wonderful
age
But
then
normal
reared
its
featureless
and
banal
head
Chain
stores
fast-food
restaurants
hotel
giants
all
spread
like
English
ivy
America
began
to
homogenize
faster
than
milk
which
of
course
is
homogenized
precisely
to
prevent
the
cream
from
rising
to
the
top
It
is
this
franchising
of
the
United
States
where
all
the
cities
lose
their
individuality
under
the
box-store
identities
being
forced
upon
them
that
is
the
United
States
that
has
turned
into
such
an
unfeeling
brutal
influence
in
the
world
It's
this
un-weirding
of
America
that
has
spread
into
globalization
where
the
corporate
powers
now
homogenize
not
just
this
country
but
as
many
corners
of
the
world
that
they
can
Losing
our
identity
in
this
way
could
this
explain
some
of
the
trend
from
blue
to
red
in
this
country
Americans
who
are
voting
republican
against
their
own
interests
are
Walmarted
to
within
an
inch
of
their
lives
Keeping
uniqueness
and
weirdness
in
American
communities
allows
something
the
republicans
can't
stand
independence
Once
a
community
feels
some
sense
of
indepence
they
might
start
questioning
what
they're
being
forced
to
swallow
Can't
let
that
happen
I
live
in
one
of
the
more
progressive
cities
in
the
country
and
yet
I
can
concede
that
little
by
little
our
weirdness
is
slipping
If
we
are
going
to
stay
strong
and
able
to
resist
this
insipid
slide
into
the
black
and
gray
control
of
the
corporatocracy
we
have
to
work
at
it
Unlike
the
columnist
I
prefer
to
go
with
the
first
definition
of
Weird
according
to
Websters
having
a
mysterious
or
unearthly
quality
of
an
odd
bizarre
or
inexplicable
nature
Now
that
is
something
to
strive
for

Nashville
Talks
Sings
Back
I
just
heard
on
the
Thom
Hartmann
show
this
morning
if
you
don't
listen
to
Thom
you
are
missing
one
of
the
best
progressive
voices
on
the
radio
about
the
Music
Row
Democrats
These
are
Country
Music
professionals
writers
singers
producers
who
have
just
had
enough
They
have
formed
a
PAC
to
raise
money
to
publicize
how
progressive
values
are
more
in
line
with
what
most
Americans
hold
true
in
their
hearts
Redefining
democrats
is
what
they
are
trying
to
do
So
despite
the
stranglehold
their
industry
has
on
progressive
ideas
they
have
stepped
out
at
the
risk
to
their
own
careers
to
take
a
stand
I
generally
don't
listen
to
country
music
anymore
because
of
the
likes
of
Toby
Keith
and
his
ilk
I
went
to
Texas
A&M
for
a
few
years
of
my
varried
undergraduate
career
and
so
was
indeed
exposed
in
the
most
obvious
way
to
country
music
I
think
it
is
a
genre
that
contains
a
lot
of
talent
and
heart
And
I
can
see
why
the
middle
of
America
relates
with
it
But
when
it
closes
the
doors
to
ideas
other
than
the
loyalist
drivel
that
comes
from
Toby-ites
then
it
loses
its
soul
When
even
Merle
Haggard
isn't
gettting
play
because
he
thinks
the
government
should
fix
America
before
it
screws
up
the
whole
world
then
something
is
wrong
So
if
you're
proud
to
call
yourself
a
Dixie
Chicks
fan
even
if
you
never
listened
to
country
music
in
your
life
then
maybe
downlowding
a
few
soon-to-be-hits
from
the
Music
Row
Dems
and
sharing
them
around
might
be
a
new
way
to
open
up
conversation
that
will
lead
to
some
more
progressive
conversions
in
your
circle
of
influence
Besides
if
we're
taking
the
country
back
we
might
as
well
take
country
music
with
it

Pluto
We
Hardly
Knew
Ye
PRAGUE
Czech
Republic
Leading
astronomers
declared
Thursday
that
Pluto
is
no
longer
a
planet
under
historic
new
guidelines
that
downsize
the
solar
system
from
nine
planets
to
eight
Yes
that's
right
A
few
human
astronomers
have
the
authority
to
declare
what
a
planet
is
and
what
a
planet
isn't
And
evidently
Pluto
ain't
it
Poor
Pluto
We've
all
known
there's
been
controversy
over
the
years
about
the
outermost
sphere
in
our
galaxy
But
is
it
really
fair
to
strip
a
poor
little
planetary-like
orb
circling
our
Sun
of
its
status
just
because
its
orbit
is
a
bit
off
Now
it
can't
be
in
the
club
anymore
For
now
membership
will
be
restricted
to
the
eight
classical
planets
in
the
solar
system
Mercury
Venus
Earth
Mars
Jupiter
Saturn
Uranus
and
Neptune
Much-maligned
Pluto
doesn't
make
the
grade
under
the
new
rules
for
a
planet
a
celestial
body
that
is
in
orbit
around
the
sun
has
sufficient
mass
for
its
self-gravity
to
overcome
rigid
body
forces
so
that
it
assumes
a
nearly
round
shape
and
has
cleared
the
neighborhood
around
its
orbit
Pluto
is
automatically
disqualified
because
its
oblong
orbit
overlaps
with
Neptune's
Pluto
is
now
a
dwarf
planet
Most
astronomers
seem
to
feel
that
the
new
classification
is
appropriate
That
Pluto
never
should
have
been
part
of
the
gang
in
the
first
place
Now
I'm
just
thinking
of
all
those
textbooks
and
teaching
materials
that
will
need
to
be
changed

Jon
Benet
I
was
trying
to
avoid
commenting
on
this
travesty
of
a
distraction
in
the
media
but
I
read
a
great
blog
this
morning
on
Oregon
Blue
by
Karol
Collymore
about
it
She
echoes
my
own
thoughts
on
the
matter
and
I
couldn't
have
said
it
better
than
her
conclusion
I
thought
it
was
just
the
mass
media
cable
news
rating
seekers
But
it's
not

was
talking
about
what
the
alleged
perputrator
was
having
for
breakfast
in
jail
I'm
sure
they
weren't
the
only
ones
just
the
one
I
happened
to
see
So
with
all
that
the
world
is
handing
us
to
deal
with
borderline
rasict
politicians
Bush
press
conferences
election
fraud
children
without
health
insurance
the
working
poor
and
raging
wars
across
the
globe
I
would
like
to
point
our
sick
obession
with
a
long
dead
child
And
one
more
greater
point
There
are
still
43
missing
children
in
Oregon
dating
back
to
1982
www.missingkids.com
This
does
not
count
the
ones
that
have
been
found
dead
or
alive
The
only
one
on
the
list
you've
heard
of
Brooke
Wilburger
another
beautiful
blonde
While
I
would
go
so
far
as
to
disagree
with
Karol
that
the
politicians
she's
talking
about
are
not
borderline
but
actually
rabid
racists
I
totally
echo
her
thoughts
here
I
think
of
the
REAL
things
that
are
going
on
in
this
world
And
I
know
that
the
rest
of
the
world
that
has
media
access
is
actually
hearing
about
those
things
while
our
media
obsesses
on
this
thing
The
real
tragedy
are
the
comatose
American
citizens
who
allow
themselves
to
lulled
into
ignorance
by
this
kind
of
constant

Fond
Farewell
I
have
been
dropping
in
on
some
of
my
favorite
blogs
that
I
didn't
have
a
chance
to
keep
up
with
in
the
last
half
year
of
my
sabbatical
and
I
was
sad
to
see
that
Notes
on
the
Atrocities
is
shutting
down
But
as
I
read
Jeff's
explanations
about
why
he
was
deciding
to
stop
blogging
it
really
hit
a
chord
with
me
I'm
throwing
in
the
towel
because
it's
not
good
for
my
mental
health
This
past
week
on
the
Buddhist
retreat
we
practiced
the
most
basic
form
of
meditation--putting
the
attention
on
the
breath
as
a
way
of
calming
the
mind
It
predates
Buddhism
and
has
been
practiced
by
most
religious
communities
for
thousands
of
years
I've
been
a
practicing
Buddhist
for
7
years
and
in
that
time
I've
never
seen
the
level
of
my
mind's
inattention
get
as
bad
as
it
is
now
It's
an
index--and
a
pretty
good
one--of
where
one's
mental
health
is
Blogging
isn't
the
only
factor
but
it's
a
central
contributor
Moreover
it's
far
from
essential--I
don't
have
to
blog
to
feed
myself
I
can't
cut
back
on
all
the
things
that
jeopardize
my
mental
health
but
blogging
is
expendable
This
hits
home
for
me
because
in
the
last
year
I
have
been
slowly
learning
about
and
beginning
the
practices
of
the
middle
way
of
buddhism
and
I
realize
that
it
is
that
clutter
in
the
mind
that
so
often
brings
you
to
that
2nd
of
the
Four
Truths
the
reason
people
suffer
is
because
they
constantly
want
what
they
don't
have
It
is
easy
to
see
how
blogging
can
lend
itself
to
this
clutter
I
think
I
felt
that
last
year
and
when
I
gave
it
up
in
December
having
every
inention
of
the
break
being
only
a
few
weeks
I
did
not
realize
how
much
I
did
not
need
it
until
I
let
it
go
Now
that
I
am
back
blogging
it
is
not
a
necessity
for
me
anymore
I
definitely
missed
it
and
I
sometimes
pine
for
being
a
dynamic
part
of
the
ol
blogging
circle
but
I
think
that's
a
symptom
of
the
same
thing
we
all
have
that
need
to
be
a
part
of
something
bigger
But
the
real
truth
is
that
I
am
part
of
something
bigger
that
is
real
Being
a
mama
being
a
teacher
being
a
participant
in
my
community
being
a
friend
These
tangible
things
are
what
not
only
enrich
our
lives
but
can
actually
be
done
contemplatively
This
is
what
I'm
learning
about
practicing
that
middle
way
if
you
cannot
do
something
or
be
something
with
your
full
awareness
then
it
is
only
sapping
you
of
your
full
self
And
I
have
not
found
a
way
I
can
contemplatively
blog
Therein
lies
the
twist
So
blogging
for
me
has
changed
its
nature
but
it
has
also
become
something
to
learn
to
savor
and
enjoy
rather
than
feel
pulled
to
and
obligated
to
I
also
agree
with
Notes
that
bloggers
are
definitely
the
way
forward
for
the
Democratic
party
to
return
to
its
progressive
roots
Blogs
are
that
medium
and
I
think
they're
the
main
reason
the
Democratic
party
has
begun
to
veer
left
after
all
these
years--and
will
keep
veering
left
if
bloggers
do
their
work
Bloggers
are
canaries
in
the
coalmine--we
speak
for
the
people
Eventually
the
country
will
follow
and
we'll
move
away
from
the
madness
of
the
neocon
precipice
I'm
proud
that
I
was
part
of
the
little
wave
that
began
way
back
when
haloscan
was
the
comment
format
on
Daily
Kos
and
before
Atrios
had
even
mentioned
Trent
Lott
But
I'm
more
proud
that
in
that
same
time
I've
raised
an
infant
into
a
cool
little
boy
I've
put
myself
through
grad
school
and
I've
become
a
high
school
social
studies
teacher
Keeping
perspective
is
definitely
a
habit
worth
practicing
I'd
like
to
thank

giving
that
