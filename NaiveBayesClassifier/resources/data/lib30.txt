Political
Olympics
Politics
and
Olympics
seem
to
go
hand
in
hand
In
Ancient
Greece
a
truce
was
announced
before
and
during
each
of
the
Olympic
festivals
to
allow
visitors
to
travel
safely
to
Olympia
During
the
truce
wars
were
suspended
armies
were
prohibited
from
entering
Elis
or
threatening
the
Games
and
legal
disputes
and
the
carrying
out
of
death
penalties
were
forbidden
But
politics
did
inevitably
play
a
role--political
alliances
were
announced
games
were
declared
invalid
if
a
hosting
country
was
out
of
favor
and
exiles
were
pardoned
In
1936
Hitler's
Berlin
games
were
possibly
the
lowest
point
in
our
history
In
Germany
Jews
Gypsies
and
other
undesirables
were
not
even
allowed
to
compete
On
the
flip
side
the
1968
Mexico
City
Olympics
gave
black
athletes
Tommie
Smith
and
John
Carlos
the
gold
and
bronze
medalists
a
platform
to
demonstrate
civil
rights
awareness
by
raising
the
black-gloved
fist
as
the
Star
Spangled
Banner
was
played
This
year
is
no
exception
and
already
it
seems
like
we
are
starting
off
on
on
a
sour
note
Take
our
host
China--in
addition
to
the
pollution
human
rights
violations
and
overall
bad
vibes
they
are
now
censoring
the
games
for
the
rest
of
the
world
China
promised
the
International
Olympics
Committee
that
they
would
provide
the
media
with
the
same
freedom
to
report
on
the
Games
as
they
enjoyed
at
previous
Olympics
However
today
we
find
out
that
the
IOC
has
brokered
a
deal
with
the
Chinese
government
which
would
allow
Internet
censorship
I
regret
that
it
now
appears
BOCOG
has
announced
that
there
will
be
limitations
on
website
access
during
Games
time
IOC
press
chief
Kevan
Gosper
said
referring
to
Beijing's
Olympic
organizers
I
also
now
understand
that
some
IOC
officials
negotiated
with
the
Chinese
that
some
sensitive
sites
would
be
blocked
on
the
basis
they
were
not
considered
Games
related
he
said
Attempts
at
the
main
press
centre
to
access
the
website
of
Amnesty
International
which
released
a
report
on
Monday
slamming
China
for
failing
to
honor
its
Olympic
human
rights
pledges
continued
to
prove
fruitless
by
mid-week
We
also
have
a
little
country
called
Iraq
who
up
until
today
was
banned
by
the
IOC
from
participating
in
the
Olympics
after
the
country's
government
disbanded
the
committee
and
appointed
a
government
official
as
its
new
leader
The
IOC
requires
national
committees
to
be
elected
and
autonomous
But
on
the
bright
side
it
looks
like
some
of
their
athletes
will
be
able
to
indeed
compete
Their
banning
led
to
widespread
criticism
of
both
the
Iraqi
government
and
the
I.O.C
On
Tuesday
at
I.O.C
headquarters
in
Lausanne
Switzerland
a
compromise
was
reached
Iraq
agreed
to
hold
elections
for
its
Olympic
committee
before
the
end
of
November
In
the
meantime
Iraq
will
have
an
interim
committee
approved
by
the
I.O.C.We
look
forward
to
putting
politics
aside
and
seeing
sprinter
Dana
Hussein
Abdul-Razzaq
and
discus
thrower
Haidar
Nasir
compete
for
their
country

They
don't
call
it
the
Dirty
South
for
nothin
HOUSTON
While
most
large
American
cities
have
started
ambitious
recycling
programs
that
have
sharply
reduced
the
amount
of
trash
bound
for
landfills
Houston
has
not
The
city's
shimmering
skyline
may
wear
the
label
of
the
world's
energy
capital
but
deep
in
Houston's
Dumpsters
lies
a
less
glamorous
superlative
It
is
the
worst
recycler
among
the
United
States
30
largest
cities
Houston
recycles
just
2.6
percent
of
its
total
waste
according
to
a
study
this
year
by
Waste
News
a
trade
magazine
By
comparison
San
Francisco
and
New
York
recycle
69
percent
and
34
percent
of
their
waste
respectively
Moreover
25,000
Houston
residents
have
been
waiting
as
long
as
10
years
to
get
recycling
bins
from
the
city
But
city
officials
say
real
progress
will
be
hard
to
come
by
Landfill
costs
here
are
cheap
The
city's
sprawling
no-zoning
layout
makes
collection
expensive
and
there
is
little
public
support
for
the
kind
of
effort
it
takes
to
sort
glass
paper
and
plastics
And
there
appears
to
be
even
less
for
placing
fees
on
excess
trash
We
have
an
independent
streak
that
rebels
against
mandates
or
anything
that
seems
trendy
or
hyped
up
said
Mayor
Bill
White
who
favors
expanding
the
city's
recycling
efforts
Houstonians
are
skeptical
of
anything
that
appears
to
be
oversold
or
exaggerated
But
Houstonians
can
change
and
change
fast
Those
without
the
special
bins
must
cart
their
recyclable
garbage
to
one
of
just
nine
full-service
drop-off
depots
in
the
city
But
when
Monica
Pope
a
locally
renowned
chef
approached
a
city-run
recycling
depot
in
her
silver
pick-up
truck
full
of
containers
she
was
turned
away
They
said
my
truck
was
too
full
Ms
Pope
recalled
laughing
There
are
cultures
that
just
don't
get
it
and
unfortunately
Houston
is
one
of
them

Gentrification
Forbidden
City
style
Call
me
old
fashion
go
ahead
I
dare
you
but
when
it
comes
to
historic
cities
progress
and
gentrification
is
not
always
a
good
thing
Growing
up
in
Brooklyn
I
know
a
little
bit
about
the
subject
but
New
York
City
is
a
relative
new-born
in
comparison
to
lets
say
Beijing
where
some
houses
date
to
the
Qing
dynasty
mid
17-early
19th
century
Very
little
is
being
done
to
preserve
these
fascinating
and
historic
areas
in
China
especially
now
with
a
booming
economy
and
the
Olympics
on
the
way
And
what's
more
frightening
is
in
an
Orwellian
twist
of
fate
buildings
are
being
razed
and
history
censored
on
purpose
to
eradicate
the
1950s-60s
Socialist
projects-style
architecture
that
is
viewed
unfavorably
by
the
government
today
The
explosion
of
construction
activity
that
has
transformed
Beijing
into
a
modern
metropolis
over
the
past
decade
also
turned
many
of
its
historical
neighborhoods
known
for
their
narrow
alleyways
or
hutongs
into
rubble
As
grass-roots
preservationists
began
sounding
the
alarm
the
aging
wood
frames
and
tile
roofs
of
the
ancient
courtyard
houses
that
give
these
neighborhoods
their
identity
were
being
supplanted
so
quickly
by
mighty
towers
that
it
was
hard
to
pinpoint
where
they
once
stood
The
current
wave
of
demolitions
was
under
way
by
the
early
1990s
as
free-market
changes
gained
momentum
and
real
estate
speculators
saw
potential
profit
in
redevelopment
It
accelerated
after
Beijing's
bid
to
play
host
to
the
Olympics
was
accepted
in
2001
and
the
city
began
a
substantial
slum-clearance
program
to
prepare
for
foreign
visitors
In
the
Qianmen
area
for
example
a
once
poor
but
thriving
neighborhood
south
of
Tiananmen
Square
that
was
home
to
many
of
the
city's
teahouses
and
theaters
hutongs
have
been
replaced
by
shopping
malls
and
office
blocks
with
ugly
postmodern
facades
that
already
look
dilapidated
although
many
are
only
a
few
years
old
As
affluent
foreigners
and
China's
new
rich
buy
the
houses
they
are
embarking
on
multimillion-dollar
renovations
that
are
robbing
the
neighborhoods
of
their
souls
The
Dutch
architect
Rem
Koolhaas
who
seems
to
be
everywhere
in
China
these
days
has
argued
that
designating
specific
buildings
as
landmarks
creates
a
distorted
version
of
history
Rather
he
has
proposed
carving
out
a
protected
wedge
through
the
city
in
which
all
of
the
city's
historical
layers
from
hutongs
on
through
the
Communist-style
projects
would
be
permanently
preserved
The
result
would
be
a
sort
of
living
museum
a
place
fixed
in
time
even
as
tumultuous
changes
unfold
around
it

The
Forgotten
War
in
Afghanistan
It's
true
Afghanistan
is
so
far
off
most
of
our
radars
that
we
have
all
but
forgotten
that
there
are
still
troops
there
It's
also
somewhat
shrouded
in
mystery
What's
going
on
over
there
Why
has
the
news
stopped
covering
it
The
Pentagon
and
presidential
rivals
Barack
Obama
and
John
McCain
all
seem
to
agree
on
the
need
to
send
more
troops
to
Afghanistan
but
they
are
at
odds
with
much
of
the
country
these
days
on
the
need
to
send
more
Americans
into
the
lawless
Afghan
mountains
The
latest
ABC
News/Washington
Post
poll
found
that
a
startling
45
percent
of
Americans
said
they
do
not
think
the
war
in
Afghanistan
is
worth
fighting
despite
the
9/11
terrorist
attacks
which
provoked
the
war
in
the
first
place
The
growing
disenchantment
with
the
Afghan
deployment
hasn't
reached
the
level
of
national
frustration
with
the
Iraq
war
but
after
more
than
six
years
with
U.S
troops
stationed
in
Afghanistan
and
violence
on
the
rise
Americans
are
becoming
increasingly
wary
about
the
country's
involvement
Fifty-one
percent
of
Americans
now
say
that
the
U.S
military
effort
in
Afghanistan
has
been
unsuccessful
up
from
24
percent
in
fall
2002
Only
44
percent
of
Americans
consider
the
war
in
Afghanistan
a
success
down
from
70
percent
in
2002
I'm
not
shocked
at
all
that
American
support
is
waning
Sholom
Keller
a
veteran
who
served
in
both
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
told
ABCNews.com
If
we
are
in
Afghanistan
because
the
U.S
was
attacked
on
Sept
11
then
I
want
to
see
the
perpetrators
captured
and
brought
to
justice
If
we're
not
finding
them
in
Afghanistan
then
I
don't
know
why
we're
there
he
added
And
if
they
are
there
I
want
to
know
why
we
haven't
found
them
in
the
last
seven
years
if
they've
been
giving
troops
the
right
intelligence
and
missions
Experts
on
the
Middle
East
told
ABCNews.com
that
many
Americans
share
Keller's
frustration
blaming
several
factors
including
the
fatigue
from
hearing
about
not
one
but
two
wars
as
well
as
pressing
issues
at
home
such
as
the
failing
economy
It's
battle
fatigue
Judith
Kipper
director
of
Middle
East
programs
at
the
Institute
of
World
Affairs
in
Washington
D.C
said
American
don't
want
war
they
know
it's
costing
a
lot
and
the
worse
the
economy
gets
at
home
the
more
people
feel
a
lack
of
confidence
in
their
daily
lives
Kipper
said
The
less
confident
they
feel
the
less
likely
they
are
to
support
foreign
wars
and
adventures
This
is
many
years
later
and
life
goes
on
Kipper
said
It's
hard
for
Americans
to
relate
to
what
happened
years
ago
to
their
battle
fatigue
and
war
weariness
now
They
care
about
the
problems
that
they're
facing
on
a
daily
basis

This
Ain't
Rockwell's
America
OURS
to
fight
for
That
simple
phrase
sits
atop
the
Rockwell
Freedom
From
Want
and
Freedom
From
Fear
posters
But
today
as
many
returning
soldiers
have
witnessed
that
sense
of
collective
responsibility
often
seems
absent
except
for
the
occasional
campaign
speech
Culled
from
a
surprising
new
exhibition
at
the
Wolfsonian
museum
at
Florida
International
University
titled
Thoughts
on
Democracy
they
are
all
artists
responses
to
Rockwell's
wartime
Four
Freedoms
series
Sixty
artists
contributed
to
the
show
But
their
creations
bear
little
resemblance
to
the
Rockwell
paintings
which
helped
raise
133
million
for
the
war
effort
in
1943
after
the
government
turned
them
into
posters
There
is
no
folksy
man
standing
up
to
speak
his
opinion
exemplifying
Freedom
of
Speech
no
devout
group
praying
Freedom
of
Worship
no
wholesome
family
sitting
down
to
a
Thanksgiving
meal
Freedom
From
Want
What
all
of
this
suggests
is
not
just
a
reinterpretation
of
Rockwell
but
a
meditation
on
an
American
crisis
of
self-confidence
the
sense
that
trust
in
American
ideals
is
giving
way
to
fear
and
uncertainty
about
how
they
are
exploited
Culture
has
long
been
a
documentarian
of
sorts
and
this
somber
mood
is
also
reflected
at
the
box
office
these
days
where
the
dystopian
world
of
Wall-E
is
a
hit
and
in
bookstores
where
titles
like
Are
You
There
Vodka
It's
Me
Chelsea
are
best
sellers
Many
of
the
artists
interviewed
said
they
felt
that
now
was
not
the
time
to
emphasize
American
greatness
as
Rockwell
did
but
rather
to
caution
people
about
the
risks
of
complacency
They
said
they
created
the
posters
because
they
loved
their
country
about
two-thirds
of
the
60
are
American
but
felt
that
their
fellow
citizens
needed
to
wake
up
to
break
free
from
anxiety
and
a
habit
of
looking
away

Reuse
Recycle
1957
Interrogation
Techniques
used
against
US
Soldiers
now
in
use
at
Guantánamo
WASHINGTON
The
military
trainers
who
came
to
Guantánamo
Bay
in
December
2002
based
an
entire
interrogation
class
on
a
chart
showing
the
effects
of
coercive
management
techniques
for
possible
use
on
prisoners
including
sleep
deprivation
prolonged
constraint
and
exposure
What
the
trainers
did
not
say
and
may
not
have
known
was
that
their
chart
had
been
copied
verbatim
from
a
1957
Air
Force
study
of
Chinese
Communist
techniques
used
during
the
Korean
War
to
obtain
confessions
many
of
them
false
from
American
prisoners
The
recycled
chart
is
the
latest
and
most
vivid
evidence
of
the
way
Communist
interrogation
methods
that
the
United
States
long
described
as
torture
became
the
basis
for
interrogations
both
by
the
military
at
the
base
at
Guantánamo
Bay
Cuba
and
by
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
Some
methods
were
used
against
a
small
number
of
prisoners
at
Guantánamo
before
2005
when
Congress
banned
the
use
of
coercion
by
the
military
The
C.I.A
is
still
authorized
by
President
Bush
to
use
a
number
of
secret
alternative
interrogation
methods
In
2002
the
training
program
known
as
SERE
for
Survival
Evasion
Resistance
Escape
became
a
source
of
interrogation
methods
both
for
the
C.I.A
and
the
military
In
what
critics
describe
as
a
remarkable
case
of
historical
amnesia
officials
who
drew
on
the
SERE
program
appear
to
have
been
unaware
that
it
had
been
created
as
a
result
of
concern
about
false
confessions
by
American
prisoners
Senator
Carl
Levin
Democrat
of
Michigan
and
chairman
of
the
Senate
Armed
Services
Committee
said
after
reviewing
the
1957
article
that
every
American
would
be
shocked
by
the
origin
of
the
training
document
I
urge
you
to
read
the
entire
article
it
only
gets
worse
More
shocking
than
this
story
is
that
there
will
never
be
any
public
outcry
We
have
become
the
Evil
Doers
we
once
detested
If
we
let
this
war
continue
we
are
all
guilty
of
crimes
against
humanity

The
government
doesn't
need
to
know
about
my
extensive
online
kitty
porn
collection
WASHINGTON
Advocacy
groups
and
some
legal
experts
told
Congress
on
Wednesday
that
it
was
unreasonable
for
federal
officials
to
search
the
laptops
of
United
States
citizens
when
they
re-enter
the
country
from
traveling
abroad
Civil
rights
groups
have
said
certain
ethnic
groups
have
been
selectively
profiled
in
the
searches
by
Border
Patrol
agents
and
customs
officials
who
have
the
authority
to
inspect
all
luggage
and
cargo
brought
into
the
country
without
obtaining
warrants
or
having
probable
cause
Companies
whose
employees
travel
overseas
have
also
criticized
the
inspections
saying
that
the
search
of
electronic
devices
could
hurt
their
businesses
The
federal
government
says
the
searches
are
necessary
for
national
security
and
for
legal
action
against
people
who
bring
illegal
material
into
the
country
But
Senator
Russ
Feingold
Democrat
of
Wisconsin
continued
if
you
asked
them
whether
the
government
has
a
right
to
open
their
laptops
read
their
documents
and
e-mails
look
at
their
photographs
and
examine

Now
that
we
have
our
candidates
in
place
it's
time
to
start
looking
at
the
bigger
picture
How
much
is
McCain
like
Bush
Are
you
comfortable
with
the
similarities
A
look
at
Mr
McCain's
25-year
record
in
the
House
and
Senate
his
2008
campaign
positions
and
his
major
speeches
over
the
last
three
months
indicates
that
on
big-ticket
issues
the
economy
support
for
continuing
the
Iraq
war
health
care
his
stances
are
indeed
similar
to
Mr
Bush's
brand
of
conservatism
Mr
McCain's
positions
are
nearly
identical
to
the
president's
on
abortion
and
the
types
of
judges
he
says
he
would
appoint
to
the
courts
The
disparities
between
the
two
are
murkier
on
other
issues
On
immigration
Mr
McCain
started
out
with
Mr
Bush
at
odds
with
the
Republican
mainstream
by
favoring
a
path
to
citizenship
for
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
then
backed
off
and
emphasized
the
border-security-first
approach
favored
by
a
majority
of
his
party
Mr
McCain
has
reversed
himself
on
some
issues
most
notably
embracing
the
Bush
tax
cuts
now
after
deriding
them
initially
as
fiscally
risky
and
excessively
skewed
to
the
wealthy
and
continues
to
adjust
his
positions
on
others
On
Monday
he
said
he
continued
to
oppose
opening
the
Arctic
National
Wildlife
Refuge
to
oil
drilling
leaving
him
at
odds
with
the
White
House
and
most
of
his
party
but
said
he
favored
giving
states
more
flexibility
to
decide
whether
to
explore
for
oil
off
their
coasts
On
balance
the
McCain
campaign
has
sought
to
emphasize
the
differences
between
Mr
McCain
and
the
unpopular
Mr
Bush
rather
than
the
similarities
In
a
CBS
News
poll
two
weeks
ago
43
percent
of
registered
voters
said
they
believed
he
would
continue
Mr
Bush's
policies
and
21
percent
said
he
would
be
more
conservative
in
his
policies
than
Mr
Bush
Twenty-eight
percent
said
he
would
be
less
conservative
than
Mr
Bush

Environment
be
damned
just
keep
them
dirty
foreigners
out
Is
this
how
much
we
hate
our
neighbors
to
the
south
that
we
would
cut
off
our
nose
to
spite
our
face
The
Bush
administration
will
waive
more
than
30
environmental
and
land-management
laws
in
order
to
finish
building
470
miles
of
border
fence
in
the
Southwest
by
the
end
of
the
year
officials
said
yesterday
The
move
permitted
under
an
exemption
granted
by
Congress
will
be
the
most
sweeping
use
of
the
administration's
waiver
authority
since
it
started
building
the
fence
to
curb
illegal
immigration
It
will
affect
environmentally
sensitive
areas
in
California
Arizona
New
Mexico
and
Texas
In
a
statement
Secretary
of
Homeland
Security
Michael
Chertoff
said
the
agency
has
no
choice
but
to
bypass
the
standard
environment
reviews
required
of
the
federal
government
Criminal
activity
at
the
border
does
not
stop
for
endless
debate
or
protracted
litigation
Chertoff
said
Congress
and
the
American
public
have
been
adamant
that
they
want
and
expect
border
security
We're
serious
about
delivering
it
and
these
waivers
will
enable
important
security
projects
to
keep
moving
forward
At
the
same
time
we
value
the
need
for
public
input
on
any
potential
impact
of
our
border
infrastructure
plans
on
the
environment
and
we
will
continue
to
solicit
it
However
Rep
Bennie
Thompson
D-Miss
who
chairs
the
House
Homeland
Security
Committee
said
the
administration
has
exceeded
what
Congress
intended
when
it
granted
the
department
added
flexibility
under
the
Real
ID
Act
Today's
waiver
represents
an
extreme
abuse
of
authority
he
said
in
a
statement
Waiver
authority
should
only
be
used
as
a
last
resort
not
simply
because
the
Department
has
failed
to
get
the
job
done
through
the
normal
process
It
was
meant
to
be
an
exception
not
the
rule
Thanks
to
this
action
by
the
Bush
administration
the
border
is
in
a
sense
more
lawless
now
than
when
Americans
first
started
moving
West
Schlickeisen
said
in
a
statement
Laws
ensuring
clean
water
and
clean
air
for
us
and
our
children
dismissed
Laws
protecting
wildlife
land
rivers
streams
and
places
of
cultural
significance
just
a
bother
to
the
Bush
administration
Laws
giving
American
citizens
a
voice
in
the
process
gone
Clearly
this
is
out
of
control."...Related

3.29
Gallon
123
Billion
Profit
Top
executives
of
the
five
biggest
U.S
oil
companies
were
pressed
Tuesday
to
explain
the
soaring
fuel
prices
amid
huge
industry
profits
and
why
they
weren't
investing
more
to
develop
renewable
energy
source
such
as
wind
and
solar
The
executives
peppered
with
questions
from
skeptical
lawmakers
said
they
understood
that
high
energy
costs
are
hurting
consumers
but
deflected
blame
arguing
that
their
profits
123
billion
last
year
were
in
line
with
other
industries
With
motorists
paying
a
national
average
of
3.29
a
gallon
at
the
pump
and
global
oil
prices
remaining
above
100
a
barrel
the
executives
were
hard
pressed
by
lawmakers
to
defend
their
profits
The
anger
level
is
rising
significantly
said
Rep
Emanuel
Cleaver
D-Mo
relating
what
he
had
heard
in
his
district
during
the
recent
two-week
congressional
recess
Our
earnings
though
high
in
absolute
terms
need
to
be
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
scale
and
cyclical
long-term
nature
of
our
industry
as
well
as
the
huge
investment
requirements
said
J.S
Simon
Exxon
Mobil's
senior
vice
president
These
companies
are
defending
billions
of
federal
subsidies
while
reaping
over
a
hundred
billion
dollars
in
profits
in
just
the
last
year
alone

Committee

House
last
year

again
on
Feb

for

giants
while
using
the
revenue
to

Banning
Makes
No
Impact
on
Abortion
Rates
As
many
of
us
have
always
believed
women
who
need
to
have
an
abortion
no
mater
the
reason
will
find
a
way
weather
it
is
legal
or
not
In
a
study
examining
abortion
trends
from
1995
to
2003
experts
also
found
that
abortion
rates
are
virtually
equal
in
rich
and
poor
countries
and
that
half
of
all
abortions
worldwide
are
unsafe
The
study
was
done
by
Gilda
Sedgh
of
the
Guttmacher
Institute
in
the
United
States
and
colleagues
from
the
World
Health
Organization
It
was
published
in
an
edition
of
The
Lancet
medical
journal
devoted
to
maternal
health
The
legal
status
of
abortion
has
never
dissuaded
women
and
couples
who
for
whatever
reason
seek
to
end
pregnancy
Beth
Fredrick
of
the
International
Women's
Health
Coalition
in
the
U.S
said
in
an
accompanying
commentary
Abortion
accounts
for
13
percent
of
maternal
mortality
worldwide
About
70,000
women
die
every
year
from
unsafe
abortions
An
additional
5
million
women
suffer
permanent
or
temporary
injury
The
continuing
high
incidence
of
unsafe
abortion
in
developing
countries
represents
a
public
health
crisis
and
a
human
rights
atrocity
Fredrick
wrote
The
number
of
worldwide
abortions
has
dipped
from
about
46
million
in
1995
to
just
under
42
million
in
2003
But
there
was
no
change
in
the
rate
of
unsafe
abortions
nearly
half
the
procedures
are
still
performed
illegally
in
potentially
dangerous
conditions
The
only
way
to
decrease
unsafe
abortion
is
to
increase
contraception
said
Sharon
Camp
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
Guttmacher
Institute
Camp
said
that
more
countries
are
allowing
women
to
have
abortions
legally
but
many
women
only
receive
medical
attention
after
a
procedure
has
gone
wrong
I
don't
think
women
should
have
to
hurt
themselves
before
they
get
medical
treatment
she
said
Nicaragua
for
example
has
banned
all
abortions
even
to
save
the
life
of
the
mother
something
most
pro-lifers
in
the
US
would
probably
agree
with
It
is
one
of
35
countries
worldwide
to
completely
ban
abortions
Two
weeks
after
Olga
Reyes
danced
at
her
wedding
her
bloated
and
disfigured
body
was
laid
to
rest
in
an
open
coffin
the
victim
her
husband
and
some
experts
say
of
Nicaragua's
new
no-exceptions
ban
on
abortion
Reyes
a
22-year-old
law
student
suffered
an
ectopic
pregnancy
The
fetus
develops
outside
the
uterus
cannot
survive
and
causes
bleeding
that
endangers
the
mother
But
doctors
seemed
afraid
to
treat
her
because
of
the
anti-abortion
law
said
husband
Agustin
Perez
By
the
time
they
took
action
it
was
too
late.[Poster

Harry
Potter
leftist
intellectual
Harry
Potter
left-wing
hero
of
the
intellectual
aristocracy
against
the
materialist
middle
classes
Well
yes
according
to
the
French
daily
Liberation
French
philosopher
Jean-Claude
Milner
identified
a
reaction
to
the
free-market
revolution
instigated
in
Britain
by
Margaret
Thatcher's
governments
Reading
it
one
has
the
feeling
that
J.K
Rowling
feels
like
many
cultivated
English
people
that
there
was
a
real
catastrophic
Thatcherite
revolution
I'm
going
to
add
Reaganomics
here
for
us
Americans
and
that
the
only
chance
for
culture
now
is
to
survive
as
an
occult
science
he
wrote
Milner
identified
the
Muggles
inhabitants
of
the
ordinary
non-magical
world
as
the
uncultured
bourgeoisie
who
did
well
materially
out
of
the
Thatcher
years
and
later
under
Tony
Blair
In
the
world
described
by
J.K
Rowling
there
are
the
Muggles
who
represent
the
Thatchero-Blairite
middle
class
going
from
the
lower
middle
class
to
the
upper
middle
class
and
then
the
others
the
people
cultivated
people
and
the
penniless
aristocracy
people
whom
you
would
expect
to
find
in
public
schools
or
at
Cambridge
he
said
Milner
said
the
disinterested
world
of
culture
upheld
by
Harry
Potter
and
his
friends
at
the
elite
Hogwarts
Academy
represented
a
form
of
opposition
to
the
values
of
the
profit-seeking
market
economy
As
such
Harry
Potter
is
a
war
machine
against
the
Thatcherite-Blairist
world
and
the
American
Way
of
Life
Ouch
I
was
all
excited
to
hear
that
Harry
Potter
was
one
of
us
a
left-leaning
intellectual
but
come
on
British
people
Cultivated
penniless
aristocracy
really
You
look
down
on
the
Muggles
for
not
being
born
to
privilege
For
being
Middle-Class
Even
I
can't
be
that
snobby
We
hate
the
Thatcher-Reagan
political
era
too
but
being
born
an
aristocrat
rather
than
working
hard
for
what
you
have
is
not
a
virtue
that
we
share

Dita
von
PETA
Updated
PETA
has
chosen
the
fur-loving
burlesque
queen
herself
Dita
von
Teese
as
their
latest
spokesmodel
Didn't
they
do
their
homework
I
have
never
agreed
with
PETA's
tactics
or
points
of
view
but
where
is
their
integrity
To
call
them
hypocritical
would
be
inane
From
PETA's
website
Dita
Von
Teese
is
the
definition
of
sexy
She
is
a
spokesmodel
for
the
MAC
Cosmetics
Viva
Glam
campaign
and
the
face
of
the
holiday
catalog
for
Frederick's
of
Hollywood
performs
live
burlesque
shows
and
has
graced
the
cover
of
magazines
around
the
world
including
Playboy
Elle
and
Harper's
Bazaar
Now
Dita
is
combining
her
sex
appeal
with
her
compassion
for
animals
to
launch
PETA's
new
ABC
campaign
From
Dita's
recent
book
Who
wouldn't
love
an
opportunity
to
don
a
cuff
of
mink
given
them
as
a
gift
or
to
wrap
a
luscious
stole
of
fox
around
her
shoulders
on
a
chilly
day
I
guess
there
are
some
people
out
there
that
wouldn't
want
to
but
I
am
definitely
not
one
of
them
Silks
satins
furs--I
have
crowded
rooms
of
such
sumptuous
materials--are
decadent
I've
always
loved
these
materials
for
their
softness
their
beauty
and
the
added
luster
of
femininity
they
bestow
upon
me
when
I
wear
them

One
of
our
faithful
readers
just
so
happens
to
be
my
sister
e-mailed
PETA
about
this
glaring
error
today
and
got
this
really
really
long
form
letter
back
excerpts
of
which
I've
included
below
First
please
know
that
as
an
organization
staffed
and
run
largely
by
women
we
would
not
do
something
that
we
felt
contributed
to
the
serious
problems
that
women
face
However
we
feel
that
there
is
nothing
shameful
or
wrong
about
being
naked
and
we
believe
that
women
and
men
should
have
the
choice
to
use
their
own
bodies
as
political
statements
Our
purpose
is
to
stop
animal
suffering
like
this
and
we
use
all
available
opportunities
to
reach
millions
of
people
with
powerful
messages
If
you
are
concerned
that
a
particular
celebrity
with
whom
we
have
worked
may
not
yet
be
100
percent
vegan
or
in
total
agreement
with
PETA's
views
on
all
animal
issues
we
can
certainly
understand
your
feelings
But
we
believe
that
by
taking
a
stand
against
even
one
form
of
animal
abuse
or
exploitation
and
by
helping
us
to
educate
the
public
about
these
issues
celebrity
supporters
can
make
a
big
difference
Thank
you
for
providing
us
with
this
opportunity
to
explain
our
position
on
this
important
topic
and
for
all
that
you
do
to
help
animals
Sincerely
The
PETA
Staff
Uhhh
ok
not
really
what
we
asked
but
thanks
anyway
And
thanks
Maria
for
the
tip
UPDATE
from
People.com
PETA's
totally
aware
of
me
Von
Teese
told
PEOPLE
before
performing
in
fox
fur
her
signature
striptease
at
the
Macy's
Passport
AIDS
benefit
last
week
I'm
not
working
with
PETA
to
tell
people
to
be
vegetarians
or
to
stop
wearing
fur
I
am
there
to
strictly
speak
about
spaying
and
neutering
your
pets
The
animal-rights
organization
says
it
was
aware
of
Von
Teese's
fur
affections
before
approaching
her
to
star
in
its
campaign.This
is
why
PETA
is
a
sham
and
why
all
it's
members
are
in
my
opinion
ditzes
who
can't
grasp
larger
more
important
social
issues
so
they
cling
to
something
simple
like
saving
kittens
and
puppies
Let's
not
forget
PETA's
number
one
gal
Pamela
Anderson
who
sported
sheep-skin
UGGS
for
years
and
then
claimed
she
had
no
idea
they
were
made
of
SKIN
That
soft
supple
feeling
is
a
dead
animal
around
your
feets
Pammy
How
can
PETA
collaborate
with
a
known
fur-advocate
Is
this
not
the
same
organization
that
throws
paint
at
women
wearing
fur
destroying
their
very
expensive
personal
property

Don't
Tase
Me
Bro
Wow
so
I
sure
did
miss
a
lot
on
my
extended
visit
to
the
Greek
island
of
Crete
you'll
get
it
if
you
pay
attention
to
the
linked
Wired
article
So
Senator
John
Kerry
had
finished
a
speech
the
University
of
Florida
and
a
during
the
Q&A
portion
an
arguably
annoying
kid
is
arrested
and
tasered
by
the
police
This
incident
brings
up
a
lot
of
questions
and
has
incited
a
lot
of
strong
reactions
Below
are
some
comments
collected
by
Wired.com
My
favorite
is
the
very
last
one
in
bold
because
it
most
concisely
encapsulates
my
initial
gut
reaction
This
was
really
sickening
to
watch
In
the
video
the
kid
offers
to
leave
and
walk
out
on
his
own
but
instead
more
and
more
of
those
officers
try
to
force
him
on
the
ground
and
into
handcuffs
What
a
horrible
way
to
handle
such
a
simple
situation
writes
Aaron
one
of
Threat
Level's
readers
The
University
and
its
police
department
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
and
embarrassed
of
the
way
they
looked
in
front
of
a
US
Senator
Totally
unacceptable
he
adds
Meanwhile
Nightwatch
who
says
that
he's
with
a
university
police
department
weighed
in
and
says
that
he
and
his
colleagues
agree
that
the
Florida
police
handled
the
situation
badly
Taserprotest_7
And
Jon
in
Austin
writes
that
as
an
intensive
care
unit
trauma
nurse
he's
concerned
about
the
safety
of
the
devices
I
am
an
ICU
Trauma
Nurse
and
I
know
there
have
been
numerous
deaths
resulting
from
the
use
of
the
Taser
device
and
no
one
knows
who
that
next
victim
is
going
to
be
It
could
be
any
one
of
us
If
we
don't
stand
up
against
the
use
of
the
Taser
who
will
be
next
Taser
International
says
its
technology
is
a
safer
use-of-force
option
on
its
web
site
I
don't
believe
that
asking
a
question
at
a
town
hall
meeting
EVEN
IF
it
is
long-winded
and
perhaps
even
a
little
combative
should
lead
to
this

Judge
Rules
Patriot
Act
Equivalent
to
Breaking
and
Entering
A
federal
judge
today
struck
down
portions
of
the
USA
Patriot
Act
as
unconstitutional
ordering
the
FBI
to
stop
issuing
national
security
letters
that
secretly
demand
customer
information
from
Internet
service
providers
and
other
businesses
U.S
District
Judge
Victor
Marrero
in
New
York
ruled
that
the
landmark
anti-terrorism
law
violates
the
First
Amendment
and
the
Constitution's
separation
of
powers
provisions
because
it
effectively
prohibits
recipients
of
the
FBI
letters
NSLs
from
revealing
their
existence
and
does
not
provide
adequate
judicial
oversight
of
the
process
Marrero
wrote
in
his
106-page
ruling
that
Patriot
Act
provisions
related
to
NSLs
are
the
legislative
equivalent
of
breaking
and
entering
with
an
ominous
free
pass
to
the
hijacking
of
constitutional
values
The
decision
has
the
potential
to
eliminate
one
of
the
FBI's
most
widely
used
investigative
tactics
It
comes
amid
widespread
concern
on
Capitol
Hill
over
reported
abuses
in
the
way
the
FBI
has
used
its
NSL
powers
But
Marrero
wrote
that
in
light
of
the
seriousness
of
the
potential
intrusion
into
the
individual's
personal
affairs
and
the
significant
possibility
of
a
chilling
effect
on
speech
and
association--particularly
of
expression
that
is
critical
of
the
government
or
its
policies--a
compelling
need
exists
to
ensure
that
the
use
of
NSLs
is
subject
to
the
safeguards
of
public
accountability
checks
and
balances
and
separation
of
powers
that
our
Constitution
prescribes
He
ruled
that
only
some
of
the
NSL
provisions
were
unconstitutional
but
found
that
it
was
impossible
to
separate
those
provisions
from
other
parts
of
the
law
He
therefore
struck
down
the
FBI's
ability
to
issue
NSLs
altogether

Rumsfeld
Resigned
Before
the
Election
Donald
Rumsfeld
architect
of
the
unpopular
Iraq
war
resigned
as
defense
secretary
before
last
year's
November
election
but
his
decision
was
not
announced
until
after
the
voting
according
to
his
resignation
letter
obtained
by
Reuters
on
Wednesday
If
its
not
already
obvious
this
is
just
another
instance
of
George
W
Bush's
unbound
hubris
He
doesn't
think
of
the
greatest
good
even
for
his
own
party
but
rather
how
he
can
save
himself
and
his
pride
Some
Republicans
are
none
too
happy
with
this
news
believing
that
their
party
might
have
kept
more
seats
in
congress
and
kept
control
of
the
Senate
if
Rumsfeld
left
before
the
election
Rumsfeld
did
not
mention
the
Iraq
war
in
his
four-paragraph
resignation
letter
Instead
the
man
who
had
become
the
focal
point
for
critics
of
the
Bush
administration's
management
of
the
war
praised
the
president
for
his
leadership
I
leave
with
great
respect
for
you
and
for
the
leadership
you
have
provided
during
a
most
challenging
time
for
our
country
The
focus
determination
and
perseverance
you
have
so
consistently
provided
have
been
needed
and
are
impressive
Rumsfeld
told
Bush
It
is
time
to
conclude
my
service
As
I
do
I
want
you
to
know
that
you
have
my
continuing
and
heartfelt
support
as
you
enter
the
final
two
years
of
your
presidency
Rumsfeld
wrote
Rumsfeld
also
praised
U.S
troops
for
their
dedication
professionalism
courage
and
sacrifice
It's
hard
to
keep
track
of
how
many
rats
have
already
jumped
the
sinking
Titanic
but
I'll
give
it
a
shot

I
Hate
You
MTA
I
know
this
is
a
somewhat
of
a
local
story
but
it's
my
blog
so
I
get
to
rant
Early
this
morning
New
York
experienced
a
bit
of
rain
ok
it
was
a
down
pour
As
a
result
the
entire
New
York
City
subway
system
crumbled
before
our
eyes
For
those
of
you
not
familiar
with
our
lovely
system
when
the
subways
stop
running
NY
stops
running
literally
There
is
mass
hysteria
and
panic
when
this
occurs
And
today
every
line
on
the
system
experienced
some
form
of
failure
Why
Because
some
rain
got
on
the
tracks
and
evidently
flooded
the
joint
In
my
part
of
Brooklyn
a
tree
fell
over
and
blocked
four
lanes
of
subway
tracks
My
normal
one
hour
commute
took
3
hours
today
I
came
to
work
sweaty
upset
and
with
a
headache
And
there
are
thousands
of
horror
commuter
stories
like
mine
just
check
out
the
New
York
Times
report
How
is
it
that
the
subway
system
stops
completely
when
there
is
a
storm
or
trains
are
put
out
of
service
when
there
is
a
sick
passenger
There
will
always
be
rain
and
people
will
always
get
sick
You'd
think
after
100
plus
years
they
would
have
some
sort
of
contingency
plan
for
these
events
How
can
it
be
that
the
trains
in
Tokyo
are
considered
extremely
late
if
they
are
not
on
the
platform
within
30
seconds
of
their
scheduled
time
Don't
they
have
rain
Don't
they
have
sick
passengers
We
need
a
major
overhaul
and
increasing
the
fare
from
the
already
high
2
a
ride
is
not
the
answer
The
government
needs
to
put
an
enormous
amount
of
money
into
the
transportation
system
and
why
not
we
deserve
it
New
York
City
is
the
main
money
maker
for
the
tristate
area
and
everyone
sucks
us
dry
We
get
very
little
financial
support
from
the
state
in
relation
to
what
we
put
in
We
no
longer
collect
a
commuter
tax
from
those
suburbanites
who
find
the
city
good
enough
to
work
in
in
during
the
day
but
run
home
at
night
to
Westchester
Long
Island
New
Jersey
and
Connecticut
to
their
big
homes
and
lower
taxes
without
paying
for
the
privilege
of
earning
a
living
here

Discipline
Hello
Kitty
style
I've
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
be
able
to
legitimately
post
a
story
about
a
Sanrio
character
and
here
it
is
Thai
police
officers
who
break
rules
will
be
forced
to
wear
hot-pink
armbands
featuring
Hello
Kitty
the
Japanese
icon
of
cute
as
a
mark
of
shame
a
senior
officer
said
Monday
Police
officers
caught
littering
parking
in
a
prohibited
area
or
arriving
late
among
other
misdemeanors
will
be
forced
to
stay
in
the
division
office
and
wear
the
armband
all
day
said
Police
Col
Pongpat
Chayaphan
The
officers
won't
wear
the
armband
in
public
The
striking
armband
features
Hello
Kitty
sitting
atop
two
hearts
Simple
warnings
no
longer
work
This
new
twist
is
expected
to
make
them
feel
guilt
and
shame
and
prevent
them
from
repeating
the
offense
no
matter
how
minor
said
Pongpat
acting
chief
of
the
Crime
Suppression
Division
in
Bangkok
Hello
Kitty
is
a
cute
icon
for
young
girls
It's
not
something
macho
police
officers
want
covering
their
biceps
Pongpat
said
Sigh
a
bunch
of
burly
cops
wearing
pink
Hello
Kitty
bands

could
be
better

Make
mine
a
Venti
All
of
my
life
I've
heard
that
coffee
is
bad
for
you
but
no
one
can
explain
to
me
exactly
what's
so
bad
about
it
seriously
if
you
know
feel
free
to
leave
a
comment
I
know
that
it
stunts
your
growth
but
I'm
not
nine
so
I
don't
care
I
know
it's
supposed
to
make
you
jittery
but
I
just
call
that
a
healthy
burst
of
energy
I
know
it's
addictive
but
who
cares
if
its
not
bad
for
you
Since
no
one
can
explain
the
bad
I'll
give
you
the
good
It
tastes
delicious
it
cuts
down
your
hunger
pangs
in
the
morning
it's
a
natural
laxative
it
tastes
delicious
it
gives
you
pep
and
oh
yea
and
it
tastes
delicious
Even
more
exciting
is
that
coffee
may
actually
have
some
real
health
benefits
Drinking
three
or
more
cups
of
coffee
a
day
may
cut
the
risk
of
colon
cancer
in
women
by
half
according
to
a
study
by
Japanese
scientists
Researchers
from
Tokyo's
National
Cancer
Center
studied
data
from
more
than
96,000
men
and
women
aged
between
40-69
over
a
period
of
up
to
12
years
from
1990
a
member
of
the
team
said
on
Wednesday
They
found
no
significant
benefit
in
men
Sorry
guys
Coffee
is
also
good
for
your
skin
The
combination
of
exercise
and
caffeine
increased
destruction
of
precancerous
cells
that
had
been
damaged
by
the
sun's
ultraviolet-B
radiation
according
to
a
team
of
researchers
at
Rutgers
University
Americans
suffer
a
million
new
cases
of
skin
cancer
every
year
according
to
the
National
Cancer
Institute
The
researchers
report
in
Tuesday's
issue
of
Proceedings
of
the
National
Academy
of
Science
that
they
studied
hairless
mice
in
four
groups
Some
were
fed
water
containing
caffeine
some
had
wheels
on
which
they
could
run
some
had
both
and
a
control
group
had
neither
The
most
dramatic
and
obvious
difference
between
the
groups
came
from
the
caffeine-drinking
runners
a
difference
that
can
likely
be
attributed
to
some
kind
of
synergy
Conney
said
Compared
with
the
control
animals
those
drinking
caffeine
had
a
95
percent
increase
in
apoptosis
in
damaged
cells
The
exercisers
showed
a
120
percent
increase
and
the
mice
that
were
both
drinking
and
running
showed
a
nearly
400
percent
increase…I
suppose
if
you
drink
a
vat
of
coffee
a
day
it
might
have
adverse
affects
but
so
does
eating
a
vat
of
anything
so
as
the
wise
ancient
Greeks
used
to
say
moderation
in
all
things

I
Agree
with
His
Holiness
Could
it
be
Is
the
man
making
some
kind
of
stone
cold
sense
or
is
it
just
me
The
pontiff
speaking
as
he
was
concluding
his
holiday
in
northern
Italy
also
said
that
while
there
is
much
scientific
proof
to
support
evolution
the
theory
could
not
exclude
a
role
by
God
They
are
presented
as
alternatives
that
exclude
each
other
the
pope
said
This
clash
is
an
absurdity
because
on
one
hand
there
is
much
scientific
proof
in
favor
of
evolution
which
appears
as
a
reality
that
we
must
see
and
which
enriches
our
understanding
of
life
and
being
as
such
He
said
evolution
did
not
answer
all
the
questions
Above
all
it
does
not
answer
the
great
philosophical
question
Where
does
everything
come
from
Benedict
also
said
the
human
race
must
listen
to
the
voice
of
the
Earth
or
risk
destroying
its
very
existence
We
all
see
that
today
man
can
destroy
the
foundation
of
his
existence
his
Earth
he
said
in
a
closed
door
meeting
with
400
priests
on
Tuesday
A
full
transcript
of
the
two-hour
event
was
issued
on
Wednesday
We
cannot
simply
do
what
we
want
with
this
Earth
of
ours
with
what
has
been
entrusted
to
us
said
the
pope
This
obedience
to
the
voice
of
the
Earth
is
more
important
for
our
future
happiness
than
the
desires
of
the
moment
Our
Earth
is
talking
to
us
and
we
must
listen
to
it
and
decipher
its
message
if
we
want
to
survive

U.S
Has
Never
Supported
the
Troops
A
few
years
ago
I
saw
a
special
on
TV
one
of
those
Dateline
20/20
type
shows
that
did
an
expos
on
the
VA
hospitals
across
the
US
What
I
saw
was
shocking
For
better
or
worse
these
men
and
women
sacrifice
themselves
for
this
country
and
even
though
I
may
not
agree
with
many
of
the
conflicts
we've
started
our
soldiers
deserve
to
come
back
to
the
finest
medical
and
psychiatric
support
that
U.S
dollars
can
buy
Instead
what
the
expos
uncovered
was
the
dirtiest
scariest
most
crowded
third-world
looking
hospitals
you
can
imagine
In
one
of
the
more
shocking
instances
they
showed
a
surveillance
video
of
a
man
whose
limbs
were
shot
off
during
some
war
A
nurse
comes
over
to
his
bed
and
simply
places
a
tray
of
food
in
front
of
him
and
walks
out
of
the
room
How
was
he
supposed
to
reach
that
food
with
no
arms
Let's
face
facts
this
country
has
never
supported
the
troops
We
use
them
up
and
spit
them
out
They
give
their
bodies
to
whatever
cause
we
send
them
to
and
they
come
back
to
nothing
This
happened
in
Vietnam
and
it's
happening
still
Now
Veterans
are
suing
the
U.S
over
shameful
failures
in
their
medical
care
The
many
medical
claims
by
veterans
of
U.S
wars
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
has
completely
overwhelmed
the
American
government
leading
to
shameful
failures
in
treatment
a
class-action
lawsuit
filed
on
Monday
alleged
Because
of
those
failures
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
and
women
who
have
suffered
grievous
injuries
fighting
in
the
ongoing
wars
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
are
being
abandoned
according
to
the
lawsuit
filed
in
the
U.S
District
Court
for
Northern
California
More
than
1.5
million
U.S
service
members
have
been
sent
to
Iraq
or
Afghanistan
since
2001
Repeated
and
extended
deployments
to
war
zones
have
driven
a
rise
in
post-traumatic
stress
among
troops
But
Pentagon
and
Veterans
Affairs
Department
lack
the
resources
and
staff
to
help
service
members
according
to
recent
reports
The
filing
by
two
veterans
groups
sued
various
officials
in
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
and
U.S
Attorney
General
Alberto
Gonzales
and
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
a
1988
law
establishing
various
VA
practices
The
two
plaintiff
organizations
represent
about
12,000
American
veterans
Unless
systemic
and
drastic
measures
are
instituted
immediately
the
costs
to
these
veterans
their
families
and
our
nation
will
be
incalculable
including
broken
families
a
new
generation
of
unemployed
and
homeless
veterans
increases
in
drug
abuse
and
alcoholism
and
crushing
burdens
on
the
health
care
delivery
system
and
other
social
services
in
our
communities
the
suit
said
The
suit
said
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
faced
a
backlog
of
600,000
claims
with
some
veterans
dying
while
waiting
to
settle
claims
It
also
claimed
the
VA
was
unable
to
deal
with
the
growing
number
of
Post-Traumatic
Stress
Disorder
cases…UPDATE
A
presidential
panel
on
military
and
veterans
health
care
released
a
report
Wednesday
concluding
that
the
system
was
insufficient
for
the
demands
of
two
modern
wars
and
called
for
improvements
including
far-reaching
changes
in
the
way
the
government
determines
the
disability
status
and
benefits
of
injured
soldiers
and
veterans
The
bipartisan
commission
made
35
recommendations
that
included
expanded
and
improved
treatment
of
traumatic
brain
injuries
and
the
type
of
post-traumatic
stress
disorders
that
overwhelmed
public
mental
healt
facilities
during
the
Vietnam
era
but
remain
stigmatized
to
this
day
President
Bush
told
reporters
at
the
White
House
late
Wednesday
that
he
had
directed
Robert
M
Gates
the
defense
secretary
and
Jim
Nicholson
secretary
of
veterans
affairs
to
take
them
seriously
and
to
implement
them
so
that
we
can
say
with
certainty
that
any
soldier
who
has
been
hurt
will
get
the
best
possible
care
and
treatment
that
this
government
can
offer
The
commission
said
fully
carrying
out
its
recommendations
would
cost
500
million
a
year
for
the
time
being
and
1
billion
annually
years
from
now
as
the
current
crop
of
fresh
veterans
and
active
military
members
ages
and
new
personnel
is
in
place.Hopefully
some
good
news

These
are
the
kinds
of
stories
that
make
us
hate
the
Republican
agenda
I
find
it
pitiful
when
the
lower
and
middle
classes
align
themselves
with
the
Right
on
an
economic
level
Do
you
think
that
they
are
looking

for
your
best
interest
Your
precious

No
They
want
to

for
the
first
time
in
a

boosting

With
the

Scary
Evangelicals
Alexandra
Pelosi
the
daughter
of
House
speaker
Nancy
Pelosi
traveled
the
Bible
Belt
to
bring
back
footage
of
fundamentalist
worshipers
as
well
as
Christian
miniature
golf
courses
wrestling
federations
car
clubs
and
theme
parks
Her
guide
for
much
of
the
journey
was
Ted
Haggard
president
of
the
30
million-member
National
Association
of
evangelicals
until
he
resigned
in
November
after
evidence
of
his
gay
relationships
and
drug
use
came
to
light
The
film
was
completed
a
week
or
so
before
that
happened
and
Pelosi
chose
not
to
revisit
the
interviews
to
make
points
on
evangelical
hypocrisy
though
she
might
have
Still
the
parts
of
the
film
that
were
most
troubling
were
not
about
abortion
or
gay
marriage
or
even
the
incredibly
pathetic
attacks
on
evolution
Rather
it
was
the
willingness
of
evangelicals
young
and
old
to
accept
as
figurative
and
literal
gospel
anything
and
everything
fed
to
them
by
authority
figures
They
appear
as
automatons
unable
or
unwilling
to
question
the
pronouncements
of
their
leaders
Also
difficult
to
watch
were
those
who
despite
having
elected
a
born-again
president
and
established
giant
radio
and
TV
networks
and
a
political
power
base
second
to
none
still
feel
they
are
a
persecuted
minority
If
Pelosi's
intent
is
to
show
that
evangelical
faith
suffocates
reason
the
point
is
well-made.Well

Doomsday
Clock
reads
5
minutes
to
midnight
The
caretakers
of
the
well-known
Doomsday
Clock
on
Wednesday
moved
its
symbolic
hands
two
minutes
closer
to
midnight
citing
nuclear
proliferation
and
for
the
first
time
global
warming
The
Doomsday
Clock
is
a
symbolic
clockface
maintained
since
1947
by
the
Board
of
Directors
of
the
Bulletin
of
the
Atomic
Scientists
at
the
University
of
Chicago
It
uses
the
analogy
of
the
human
race
being
at
a
time
that
is
minutes
to
midnight
where
midnight
represents
destruction
by
nuclear
war
It
was
the
fourth
time
since
the
end
of
the
Cold
War
that
the
clock
has
ticked
forward
this
time
from
11:53
to
11:55
amid
fears
over
what
scientists
are
describing
as
a
second
nuclear
age
prompted
largely
by
atomic
standoffs
with
Iran
and
North
Korea
As
scientists
we
understand
the
dangers
of
nuclear
weapons
and
their
devastating
effects
and
we
are
learning
how
human
activities
and
technologies
are
affecting
climate
systems
in
ways
that
may
forever
change
life
on
Earth
said
BAS
member
Stephen
Hawking
the
renowned
cosmologist
and
mathematician
As
citizens
of
the
world
we
have
a
duty
to
alert
the
public
to
the
unnecessary
risks
that
we
live
with
every
day
and
to
the
perils
we
foresee
if
governments
and
societies
do
not
take
action
now
to
render
nuclear
weapons
obsolete
and
to
prevent
further
climate
change
Since
it
was
set
to
seven
minutes
to
midnight
in
1947
the
hand
has
been
moved
18
times
including
Wednesday's
move
It
came
closest
to
midnight
just
two
minutes
away
in
1953
following
the
successful
test
of
a
hydrogen
bomb
by
the
United
States
It
has
been
as
far
away
as
17
minutes
set
there
in
1991
following
the
demise
of
the
Soviet
Union

Darfur
awareness
Most
of
us
have
heard
the
name
Darfur
but
we
aren't
quite
sure
where
it
is
and
what's
really
going
on
there
Genocide
Displaced
refugees
Rape
Murder
Huh
Well
here's
one
way
you
can
help
and
become
a
little
more
aware
at
the
same
time

he's
the

NY
design
has
teamed
up
with
the
International
Rescue
Committee
to
create
a
very
special
posters
whose
sale
benefit
the
organization
It's
only
35
so
if
you
have
the
cash
why
not
Or
download
a
free
screensaver
and
read
up
on
the
crisis
at
theIRC.com
With
more
than
2
million
people
driven
from
their
homes
Darfur
has
been
described
as
one
of
the
world's
worst
humanitarian
crises
Despite
the
signing
of
the
Darfur
Peace
Agreement
in
May
2006
fighting
is
increasing
across
the
region
and
the
people
of
Darfur
are
suffering
violence
atrocities
and
abduction
Amid
desperate
conditions
the

Committee
delivers
lifesaving
aid
protects

out
for
global
action
on

Hey
There
Lonely
Boy
China
is
facing
a
crisis
not
enough
women
The
country's
major
gender
imbalance
means
that
in
the
very
near
future
there
will
be
a
shortage
of
wives
which
means
a
real
threat
to
social
stability
I
don't
know
why
this
story
had
me
a
bit
giddy
I
guess
that's
my
angry
feminist
side
sticking
up
my
middle
finger
and
yelling
out
That's
what
you
get
when
you
choose
to
abort
all
your
baby
girls
Now
suck
it
Ok
maybe
it's
not
all
their
fault
seeing
as
how
the
government
only
allows
families
one
child
and
seeing
as
how
most
traditional
cultures
value
male
heirs
god
knows
why
over
females
But
still
I
feel
somewhat
justified
Maybe
that'll
learn
ya
China
will
have
30
million
more
men
of
marriageable
age
than
women
in
less
than
15
years
as
a
gender
imbalance
resulting
from
the
country's
tough
one-child
policy
becomes
more
pronounced
state
media
reported
Friday
The
tens
of
millions
of
men
who
will
not
be
able
to
find
a
wife
could
also
lead
to
social
instability
problems
the
China
Daily
said
in
a
front-page
report
China
imposed
strict
population
controls
in
the
1970s
to
limit
growth
of
its
huge
population
but
one
side
effect
has
been
a
jump
in
gender
selection
of
babies
Traditional
preferences
for
a
son
mean
some
women
abort
their
baby
if
an
early
term
sonogram
shows
it
is
a
girl
Discrimination
against
the
female
sex
remains
the
primary
cause
of
China's
growing
gender
imbalance
Liu
Bohong
vice
director
of
the
women
studies
institute
under
the
All-China
Women's
Federation
was
quoted
as
saying
in
a
report
from
the
State
Population
and
Family
Planning
Commission
Sex
selective
abortion
is
prohibited
but
the
government
says
the
practice
remains
widespread
especially
in
rural
areas
UPDATE
China
sounded
the
alarm
over
the
country's
growing
gender
imbalance
on
Monday
vowing
to
improve
protection
of
infant
girls
and
ratchet
up
punishment
for
those
who
perform
abortions
based
on
the
sex
of
the
baby
Abortions
to
select
a
child's
gender
are
not
currently
outlawed
However
a
family
planning
regulation
prohibits
the
practice
except
for
medical
reasons
People
who
perform
illegal
scans
or
abortions
face
a
minimum
fine
of
10,000
yuan
1,255
or
more
based
on
their
earnings
from
the
procedure

Pay
It
Forward
Jerk-Ass
Well
the
holiday
season
is
over
and
the
good
cheer
might
be
gone
with
it
but
here's
an
article
from
the
NY
Times
Magazine
about
positive
psychology
It's
quite
a
bit
more
than
the
concept
of
positive
reinforcement
you
might
have
heard
about
in
Psychology
101
as
it's
really
best
described
as
asking
the
question
of
what
makes
life
worth
living
The
focus
of
Kashdan's
class
that
day
was
the
distinction
between
feeling
good
which
according
to
positive
psychologists
only
creates
a
hunger
for
more
pleasure
they
call
this
syndrome
the
hedonic
treadmill
and
doing
good
which
can
lead
to
lasting
happiness
The
students
had
been
asked
first
to
do
something
that
gave
them
pleasure
and
then
to
perform
an
act
of
selfless
kindness
They
approached
the
first
part
of
the
assignment
eagerly
One
student
recounted
having
sex
with
her
boyfriend
30
feet
underwater
while
scuba
diving
Another
said
he
went
to
Coastal
Flats
and
got
hammered
A
third
attended
a
Nascar
race
in
North
Carolina
smoked
drank
and
had
sex
Some
also
watched
favorite
TV
shows
others
chatted
with
friends
When
it
came
time
to
talk
about
the
second
part
of
the
assignment
the
students
were
excited
too
The
Nascar
attendee
who
was
afraid
of
needles
gave
blood
Another
collected
clothes
from
family
members
and
donated
them
to
a
shelter
for
battered
women
The
boy
who
had
gotten
hammered
bought
a
homeless
person
a
12-pack
of
Natty
Ice
at
a
7-Eleven
wondering
if
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
A
fourth
gave
her
waiter
at
Denny's
a
50
tip

It's
January
in
NY
and
I'm
wearing
a
tube
top
I'm
scared
I'm
really
scared
I
woke
up
this
morning
to
the
news
that
tomorrow's
temperatures
will
reach
the
high
60s
It's
January
in
New
York
and
I'm
sweating
Scientists
from
around
the
world
are
confirming
everyone's
suspicions
that
this
is
not
normal
Britain's
Meteorological
Office
said
there
was
a
60
percent
probability
that
2007
would
break
the
record
set
by
1998
which
was
1.20
degrees
over
the
long-term
average
This
new
information
represents
another
warning
that
climate
change
is
happening
around
the
world
the
office
said
The
reason
for
the
forecast
is
mostly
due
to
El
Nino
a
cyclical
warming
trend
now
under
way
in
the
Pacific
Ocean
The
event
occurs
irregularly
the
last
one
happened
in
2002
and
typically
leads
to
increased
temperatures
worldwide
While
this
year's
El
Nino
is
not
as
strong
as
it
was
in
1997
and
1998
its
combination
with
the
steady
increase
of
temperatures
due
to
global
warming
from
human
activity
may
be
enough
to
break
the
Earth's
temperature
record
said
Phil
Jones
the
director
of
the
Climatic
Research
unit
at
the
University
of
East
Anglia
Because
of
the
warming
due
to
greenhouse
gases
even
a
moderate
warming
event
is
enough
to
push
the
global
temperatures
over
the
top
he
said
El
Nino
is
an
independent
variable
he
said
But
the
underlying
trends
in
the
warming
of
the
Earth
is
almost
certainly
due
to
the
release
of
carbon
dioxide
into
the
atmosphere."…In

one
was
present
to
see
it
in
Canada's
remote
north
Scientists
using
satellite
images
later
noticed
that
it
became
a
newly
formed
ice
island
in
just
an
hour
and
left
a
trail
of
icy
boulders
floating
in
its
wake
Watch
the
satellite
images
that
clued
in
ice
watchers
This
is
a
dramatic
and
disturbing
event
It
shows
that
we
are
losing
remarkable
features
of
the
Canadian
North
that
have
been
in
place
for
many
thousands
of
years
We
are
crossing
climate
thresholds
and
these
may
signal
the
onset
of
accelerated
change
ahead
Vincent
said
Thursday
In
10
years
of
working
in
the
region
he
has
never
seen
such
a
dramatic
loss
of
sea
ice
he
said
Scientists
say
it
is
the
largest
event
of
its
kind
in
Canada
in
30
years
and
point
their
fingers
at
climate
change
as
a
major
contributing
factor
It
is
consistent
with
climate
change
Vincent
said
adding
that
the
remaining
ice
shelves
are
90
percent
smaller
than
when
they
were
first
discovered
in
1906…Al

always
you
were

The
Season
of
Giving
Here's
an
informative
and
interesting
read
from
the
NY
Times
Magazine
about
charitable
giving
and
a
lot
more
by
Peter
Singer
a
professor
of
bioethics
at
Princeton
University
A
lot
of
introspective
questions
came
to
mind
while
reading
this
article
especially
since
the
holiday
season
is
upon
us
Am
I
a
good
person
What
could
I
do
to
improve
the
world
around
me
Should
I
really
spend
another
60
on
yet
another
Xbox
360
game
How
does
social
responsibility
extend
past
the
immediate
future
and
outside
of
my
immediate
community
This
article
brings
up
some
really
interesting
points
about
the
responsibility
of
individuals
to
contribute
to
charity
how
the
U.S
government
should
be
allocating
foreign
development
aid
and
just
what
motivates
us
as
human
beings
Quote
from
Singer
here
In
any
case
even
if
we
were
to
grant
that
people
deserve
every
dollar
they
earn
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
what
they
should
do
with
it
We
might
say
that
they
have
a
right
to
spend
it
on
lavish
parties
private
jets
and
luxury
yachts
or
for
that
matter
to
flush
it
down
the
toilet
But
we
could
still
think
that
for
them
to
do
these
things
while
others
die
from
easily
preventable
diseases
is
wrong
In
an
article
I
wrote
more
than
three
decades
ago
at
the
time
of
a
humanitarian
emergency
in
what
is
now
Bangladesh
I
used
the
example
of
walking
by
a
shallow
pond
and
seeing
a
small
child
who
has
fallen
in
and
appears
to
be
in
danger
of
drowning
Even
though
we
did
nothing
to
cause
the
child
to
fall
into
the
pond
almost
everyone
agrees
that
if
we
can
save
the
child
at
minimal
inconvenience
or
trouble
to
ourselves
we
ought
to
do
so
Anything
else
would
be
callous
indecent
and
in
a
word
wrong
The
fact
that
in
rescuing
the
child
we
may
for
example
ruin
a
new
pair
of
shoes
is
not
a
good
reason
for
allowing
the
child
to
drown
Similarly
if
for
the
cost
of
a
pair
of
shoes
we
can
contribute
to
a
health
program
in
a
developing
country
that
stands
a
good
chance
of
saving
the
life
of
a
child
we
ought
to
do
so.Remember
that
we
can
easily
help
without
even
giving
money
by
supporting
organizations
such
as
one.org

Gender
bias
increases
poverty
Inequality
at
home
between
men
and
women
leads
to
poorer
health
for
the
children
and
greater
poverty
for
the
family
says
a
new
study
The
UN
children's
agency
Unicef
found
that
where
women
are
excluded
from
family
decisions
children
are
more
likely
to
be
under-nourished
Unicef
surveyed
family
decision-making
in
30
countries
around
the
world
Their
chief
finding
is
that
equality
between
men
and
women
is
essential
to
lowering
poverty
and
improving
health
especially
of
children
in
developing
countries
For
example
in
Ivory
Coast
and
Ghana
it
was
discovered
that
when
women's
income
increased
for
whatever
reason
they
spent
the
extra
on
more
food
for
the
family
whereas
an
increase
in
men's
income
made
no
significant
difference
Unicef
said
In
many
households
across
the
developing
world
Unicef
found
that
women
are
excluded
from
health-related
decisions
Children
in
these
families
are
more
likely
to
be
undernourished
as
the
family
spends
less
on
food
Unicef
said
Gender
equality
in
family
decision-making
in
South
Asia
would
lead
to
13.4m
fewer
malnourished
children
a
13
reduction
the
report
said...Perhaps
the
old
adage
is
true
if
we
ruled
the
world
maybe
the
world
would
be
a
better
place

forced
to
make

emergency
landing
Monday
morning
after
a
passenger
lit
a
match
to
disguise
the
scent
of
flatulence
authorities
said
The
Dallas-bound
flight
was
diverted
to
Nashville
after
several
passengers
reported
smelling
burning
sulfur
from
the
matches
said
Lynne
Lowrance
spokeswoman
for
the
Nashville
International
Airport
Authority
All
99
passengers
and
five
crew
members
were
taken
off
and
screened
while
the
plane
was

and
luggage
was

The

questioned
a

conceal
a

Lowrance

She
had

Rape
encourages
Free
Sex
Due
to
worldwide
pressure
Pakistan
is
amending
its
law
to
exclude
rape
under
Sharia
law
which
deals
with
many
aspects
of
day-to-day
life
including
politics
economics
banking
business
law
contract
law
sexuality
and
social
issues
If
your
not
familiar
with
the
Sharia
court
system
read
about
Mukhtar
Mai
who
was
gang
raped
by
orders
of
the
Punjab
village
council
as
retribution
for
her
brother's
adultery
or
what
we
in
the
west
call
a
date
Until
now
rape
cases
were
dealt
with
in
Sharia
courts
Victims
had
to
have
four
male
witnesses
to
the
crime
if
not
they
faced
prosecution
for
adultery.However
Pakistan's
opposition
Islamic
alliance
the
MMA
is
threatening
country-wide
protests
over
amendments
to
the
country's
rape
laws
The
MMA
parties
boycotted
the
vote
saying
the
bill
encouraged
free
sex
They
also
accuse
President
Musharraf
of
pleasing
foreign
powers
This
bill
has
been
brought
under
the
directions
of
the
United
States
and
implemented
by
their
representative
in
Pakistan
General
Musharraf
Liaquat
Baloch
an
MMA
leader
was
quoted
by
AFP
news
agency
as
saying
Adultery
which
has
always
been
illegal
will
still
be
tried
by
both
civil
and
Sharia
courts
depending
on
which
system
the
complainant
chooses
Religious
parties
called
the
new
legislation
a
harbinger
of
lewdness
and
indecency
in
the
country
and
against
the
strictures
of
the
Koran
and
Sharia
law
Orthodox
and
Hasidic
Jews
have
a
saying
I
often
hear
here
in
Brooklyn
Thank
God
I
was
born
a
man
Well
I'm
modifying
it
to
Thank
God
I
was
born
in
the
civilized
world
It's
abhorrent
to
equate
a
forcible
violation
of
one's
body
to
adultery

Why
Not
Wiccan
The
widows
of
two
combat
veterans
sued
the
government
Monday
for
not
allowing
Wiccan
symbols
on
their
husbands
military
headstones
The
U.S
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
allows
military
families
to
choose
any
of
38
authorized
headstone
images
The
list
includes
commonly
recognized
symbols
for
Christianity
Buddhism
Islam
and
Judaism
as
well
as
those
for
smaller
religions
such
as
Sufism
Reoriented
Eckiankar
and
the
Japanese
faith
Seicho-No-Ie
The
Wiccan
pentacle
a
five-pointed
star
surrounded
by
a
circle
is
not
on
the
list
an
omission
that
the
widows
say
is
unconstitutional
The
lawsuit
was
filed
by
Roberta
Stewart
whose
husband
Nevada
National
Guard
Sgt
Patrick
Stewart
was
killed
in
combat
in
Afghanistan
last
year
and
Karen
DePolito
whose
husband
Jerome
Birnbaum
is
a
Korean
War
veteran
who
died
last
year
Wiccans
worship
the
Earth
and
believe
they
must
give
to
the
community
Some
consider
themselves
white
or
good
witches
pagans
or
neo-pagans
Approximately
1,800
active-duty
service
members
identify
themselves
as
Wiccans
according
to
2005
Defense
Department
statistics…Obviously
this
is
a
prejudice
of
our
Judeo-Christian
majority
that
is
still
completely
ignorant
about
so-called
pagan
religions
People
who
worship
the
earth
or
several
gods
are
not-necessarily
agents
of
the
dark
lord
For
God's
sake
Scientology
is
a
recognized
religion
Here
we
have
a
belief
in
which
millions
of
followers
actually
think
that
life
started
on
this
planet
when
Zenu
an
alien
overlord
came
to
this
planet
to
destroy
the
evil
Thetins
by
tossing
them
in
a
volcano
of
burning
lava
only
to
have
them
resurface
on
earth

inhabit

souls

The
timing
is
right

Bush
said
at
the

House
Wednesday
afternoon
Rumsfeld
has
been
heavily
criticized
for
his
policies
in
Iraq
and
exit
polls
taken
during
Tuesday's
midterm
election
seen
by
some
as
a
referendum
on
Bush
and
his
administration
showed
strong
voter
dissatisfaction
57
percent
with
the
Iraq
war."I
recognize
that
many
Americans
voted
last
night
to
register
their
displeasure
with
the
lack
of
progress
being
made

It's
time
to
high-tail
it
out
of
there
The
White
House
said
Monday
that
President
Bush
was
no
longer
using
the
phrase
stay
the
course
when
speaking
about
the
Iraq
war
in
a
new
effort
to
emphasize
flexibility
in
the
face
of
some
of
the
bloodiest
violence
there
since
the
2003
invasion
Hey
check
out
my
last
article
below
Mr
Bush
used
the
slogan
in
a
stump
speech
on
Aug
31
but
has
not
repeated
it
for
some
time
Still
Mr
Snow's
pronouncement
was
a
stark
example
of
the
complicated
line
the
White
House
is
walking
this
election
year
in
trying
to
tag
Democrats
as
wanting
to
cut
and
run
from
Iraq
without
itself
appearing
wedded
to
unsuccessful
tactics
there
Hmm
you
think
In
a
related
note
America'?s
top
military
and
civilian
officials
in
Iraq
said
today
that
the
Baghdad
government
has
agreed
to
a
timetable
for
a
series
of
milestones
to
be
pursued
in
the
coming
year
including
cracking
down
on
Shiite
militias
completing
a
national
compact
between
competing
political
groups
persuading
Sunni
insurgents
to
lay
down
their
arms
and
settling
contentious
issues
like
the
division
of
oil
revenues
Gen
George
W
Casey
Jr
the
senior
American
military
commander
in
Iraq
said
that
at
their
current
rate
of
development
in
12
to
18
months
the
Iraqi
security
forces
will
emerge
as
the
dominant
force
in
Iraq
possibly
with
some
American
support
