Apparently
the
best-funded
campaign
in
history
the
Obama
campaign
has
the
media
so
much
in
hand
they
think
they
can
charge
the
media
not
just
for
normal
and
customary
charges
but
also
for
the
coverage
itself

Some
news
audiences
are
more
politically
savvy
than
others
according
to
a
new
poll
with
readers
of
The
New
Yorker
and
similar
high-brow
magazines
being
the
most
knowledgeable
The
survey
conducted
between
April
30
and
June
1
by
the
Pew
Research
Center
for
the
People
the
Press
measured
the
political
knowledge
of
3,612
U.S
adults
Participants
were
asked
to
name
the
controlling
party
of
the
U.S
House
of
Representatives
the
U.S
secretary
of
state
and
Great
Britain's
prime
minister
Overall
just
18
percent
of
participants
answered
all
three
questions
correctly
More
than
50
percent
of
Americans
knew
that
the
Democrats
have
a
majority
in
the
House
while
42
percent
could
identify
the
secretary
of
state
Condoleezza
Rice
Less
than
30
percent
could
name
the
prime
minister
of
Great
Britain
Gordon
Brown
Perfect
scores
The
best-informed
news
audiences
crossed
the
ideological
spectrum
Nearly
half
of
regular
readers
of
The
New
Yorker
The
Atlantic
and
Harper's
Magazine
answered
all
three
political
knowledge
questions
correctly
A
perfect
score
was
obtained
by
44
percent
of
regular
listeners
of
National
Public
Radio
NPR
43
percent
of
regular
viewers
of
MSNBC's
Hardball
with
Chris
Matthews
and
42
percent
of
the
Fox
News
Channel's
Hannity
Colmes
audience
Thirty-four
percent
of
The
Colbert
Report
audience
and
30
percent
of
The
Daily
Show
audience
got
all
three
questions
correct
While
most
news
audiences
knew
that
Democrats
have
a
majority
in
the
House
participants
struggled
to
correctly
name
the
current
British
prime
minister
Just
four
news
audiences
had
a
majority
who
correctly
identified
Gordon
including
regular
readers
of
The
New
Yorker
and
similar
magazines
such
as
The
Atlantic
regular
NPR
listeners
regular
readers
of
political
magazines
such
as
The
Weekly
Standard
and
The
New
Republic
and
regular
viewers
of
Hardball
Just
44
percent
of
BBC
viewers
identified
the
prime
minister
correctly
Here's
a
detailed
breakdown
of
the
percentage
of
individuals
answering
each
of
the
three
questions
correctly
from
the
different
news
audiences

In
general
well-educated
news
audiences
scored
high
on
political
knowledge
For
instance
54
percent
of
the
regular
readers
of
publications
such
as
The
New
Yorker
The
Atlantic
and
Harper's
Magazine
are
college
graduates
as
are
54
percent
of
regular
NPR
listeners
However
several
news
audiences
with
relatively
low
proportions
of
college
graduates
also
scored
well
on
the
news
quiz
Just
31
percent
of
regular
Hannity
Colmes
viewers
are
college
graduates
Even
still
42
percent
Hannity
viewers
got
perfect
scores
on
the
political
knowledge
quiz
compared
with
44
percent
of
NPR
listeners
Nearly
40
percent
of
the
regular
audience
of
the
news
parody
The
Colbert
Report
are
college
graduates
compared
with
30
percent
of
The
Daily

viewers
Both
shows
have
younger
audiences
than
other
TV
news
sources
with
less
than
a
quarter
of
Colbert
and
Daily

viewers
over
the
age
of
50
compared
with
more
than
half
of

and
Hannity

viewers
being

This

can

give
90

a

cut
First
repeal
the

cut

some

and
hope
you
avoid
the

in

is

Canada's
Grits
a/k/a
the
Liberal
Party
the
party
international
journalists
see
as
the
natural
masters
of
the
great
frozen
north
have
had
yet
another
truly
lousy
national
election
losing
ground
even
in
their
stonghold
of
Ontario
They
have
followed
the
policies
of
Pierre
Trudeau
since
the
1970s
and
since
he
is
the
reason
we
left
the
country
for
the
United
States
I
can
only
exult
Heh
he
They
lost
19
seats
from
an
already
record
low
nearly
70
seats
short
of
the
Conservative
Party
and
the
Greens
were
blanked
They
are
rolling
back
some
of
the
excesses
of
National
Health-care
up
there
but
all
we
have
to
do
it
stop
it
They
said
of
the
Liberal
leader
People
spoke
about
him
the
same
way
they
discuss
a
family
member
or
a
friend-of-a-friend
who
they
know
is
completely
inadequate
in
some
respect
of
their
ability
to
do
their
job
but
they
don't
really
want
to
get
into
the
details
so
they
just
stop
mid-sentence
instead
of
enumerating
all
the
defects
Mr
Sears
said
It's
like
they
wanted
him
to
be
more
successful
they
respected
him
as
a
man
a
politician
an
intelligent
person
but
it
just
didn't
work
out
He
added
later
If
by
some
sort
of
fate
or
ego
Mr
Dion
would
hang
around
for
a
year
I
think
you
could
judge
that
quiet
sort
of
thank
you
very
much
but
it's
over
would
go
to
a
nastier
place
Mr
Sears
said
The
political
thinking
of
the
Canuck
electorate
also
seems
sound
There
is
obvious
scar
tissue
from
the
deficits
of
the
eighties
and
early
nineties
Mr
Sears
said
People
don't
want
it
the
same
as
last
time
They
are
saying
you
better
have
a
plan
don't
give
money
for
political
reasons
or
regional
favouritism
and
by
the
way
if
you
do
have
to
go
into
deficit
it
better
be
a
short
one
we
want
you
to
return
to
a
balanced
budget
soon
There
is
also
confidence
in
the
stability
of
this
country's
banking
system
and
resistance
to
any
government
support
similar
to
what
has
occurred
in
the
United
States
There
was
also
concern
about
bank
mergers
or
increased
involvement
by
foreign
banks
in
Canada
When
you
say
In
times
like
these
don't
banks
need
to
get
bigger
to
get
better
People
say
that
bigger
is
worse
just
look
what
happened
to
AIG
Mr
Watt
said
a
reference
to
the
American
insurance
company
that
needed
more
than
85-billion
in
support
from
the
U.S
government
Thank
you
James
Taranto
for
alerting
me
to
electoral
news
I
was
too
busy
to
follow
or
realize
was
going
on
a
good
indication
it
is
not
following
the
preferred
trend
down
here
Mark
Steyn
has
analysis
and
news
of
this
latest
wonderful
election
The
bigger
lesson
is
that
the
Euro-Canadian
social
democratic
states
continue
their
modest
right-of-center
trend
No
community
organizers
from
the
William
Ayers
school
seem
to
be
tickling
the
public
fancy
in
Canada
Britain
Japan
or
the
Continent
Obama
is
thus
a
peculiar
example
of
American
exceptionalism
and
also
of
Canuck
elections
past
David
Frumis
glummer
than
Steyn
about
the
rest
of
the
world
but
also
quite
unnaturally
perky
about
Canada
Hmm
If
Obama
is
as
bad
as
some
fear
too
uncentered
to
be
terrifying
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
still
has
the
air
of
someone
amazed
he
is
where
he
is
and
unable
to
make
bold
moves
his
ads
sound
almost
Reaganesque
not

Received
this
chain
email
but
it
is
pretty
good
I'm
voting
Democrat
because
I'm
way
too
irresponsible
to
own
a
gun
and
I
know
that
these
local
police
are
all
I
need
to
protect
me
from
murderers
and
thieves
I'm
voting
Democrat
because
I
love
the
fact
that
I
can
now
marry
whatever
I
want
I've
decided
to
marry
my
horse
I'm
voting
Democrat
because
I
believe
oil
companies
profit
of
5
on
a
gallon
of
gas
are
obscene
but
the
government
taxing
the
same
gallon
of
gas
at
15
isn't
I'm
voting
Democrat
because
I
believe
the
government
will
do
a
better
job
of
spending
the
money
I
earn
than
I
would
I'm
voting
Democrat
because
freedom
of
speech
is
fine
as
long
as
nobody
is
offended
by
it
I'm
voting
Democrat
because
when
we
pull
out
of
Iraq
I
trust
that
the
bad
guys
will
stop
what
they're
doing
because
they
now
think
we're
good
people
I'm
voting
Democrat
because
I
believe
that
people
who
can't
tell
us
if
it
will
rain
on
Friday
CAN
tell
us
that
the
polar
ice
caps
will
melt
away
in
ten
years
if
I
don't
start
driving
a
Prius
I'm
voting
Democrat
because
I'm
not
concerned
about
the
slaughter
of
millions
of
babies
so
long
as
we
keep
all
death
row
inmates
alive
I'm
voting
Democrat
because
I
believe
that
business
should
not
be
allowed
to
make
profits
for
themselves
They
need
to
break
even
and
give
the
rest
away
to
the
government
for
redistribution
as
THEY
see
fit
I'm
voting
Democrat
because
I
believe
liberal
judges
need
to
rewrite
the
Constitution
every
few
days
to
suit
some
fringe
kooks
who
would
NEVER
get
their
agendas
past
the
voters
I'm
voting
Democrat
because
my
head
is
so
firmly
planted
up
my
it's
unlikely
that
I'll
ever
have
another
point
of
view
I
want
to
be

The
Junior
Senator
from
Illinois
who
claims
he
is
more
qualified
than
the
Senior
Senator
from
Arizona
because
the
latter
chose
a
gaffe
prone
rising
star
reformer
new
to
the
national
spotlight
while
he
himself
chose
a
gaffe
prone
Senator
and
repeatedly

Presidential
candidate
who
has
been
repeatedly
cast
out
of
the
national
spotlight
for
decades
has
been
hedging
a
lot
lately
on
pulling
troops
out
of
Iraq
willy
nilly
Following
up
on
a
column
earlier
this
week
quoting
Jesse
Jackson's
prediction
that
Obama
would
leave
troops
in
Iraq
but
stick
it
to
Israel
James
Taranto
has
some
reasons
why
here
and
here
that
track
with
the
old
favourite
line
that
military
involvement
in
a
foreign
country
only
gets
wall
to
wall
coverage
if
things
are
going
badly
not
a
lot
of
Iraq
coverage
lately
Perhaps
the
most
convincing
bit
can
be
found
in
the
first
piece
and
reads
as
follows
Glug
Glug
Glug
In
recent
weeks
most
Democrats
seem
to
have
concluded
that
the
war
effort
is
a
sinking
ship
the
American
people
have
already
jumped
overboard
and
if
Democratic
politicians
follow
them
off
the
side
the
people
will
reward
them
by
putting
them
in
charge
of
the
life
rafts
The
Washington
Post
notes
some
poll
results
that
suggest
the
Dems
are
all
wet
Seventy
percent
of
people
surveyed
said
that
criticism
of
the
war
by
Democratic
senators
hurts
troop
morale
with
44
percent
saying
morale
is
hurt
a
lot
according
to
a
poll
taken
by
RT
Strategies
Even
self-identified
Democrats
agree
55
percent
believe
criticism
hurts
morale
while
21
percent
say
it
helps
morale
Their
poll
also
indicates
many
Americans
are
skeptical
of
Democratic
complaints
about
the
war
Just
three
of
10
adults
accept
that
Democrats
are
leveling
criticism
because
they
believe
this
will
help
U.S
efforts
in
Iraq
A
majority
believes
the
motive
is
really
to
gain
a
partisan
political
advantage
The
Washington
Times
Jennifer
Harper
and
the
Los

Max
Boot
both
note
the
result
of
another
poll
this
one
by
the
Pew

Center
for

People
and
the
Press
which
shows
that
the
general
public
is
considerably
more
optimistic
about
Iraq
than
just
about
any
group
of
opinion
leaders
Respondents
were
asked
if
they
thought
efforts
to
establish
a
successful
democracy
there
will
succeed

fail

Watching
Meet
the
Press
on
Sunday
we
were
especially
struck
by
the
dour
drumbeat
from
the
journalists
panel
which
consisted
of
David
Broder
David
Gregory
Eugene
Robinson
and
Judy
Woodruff
All
agreed
that
democracy
in
Iraq
is
simply
hopeless
But
their
pessimism
was
totally
divorced
from
the
facts
Not
one
even
mentioned
the
elections
scheduled
for
two
weeks
from
Thursday
Maybe
it
will
turn
out
that
we
can
do
without
experts
after
all
Makes
the
prospect
of
his
Presidency
a
little
easier
to
stomach
I
wonder
if
MoveOn
which
opposes
our
involvement
in
Afghanistan
will
have
a
conniption
or
simply
pretend
none
of
this
ever
happened
That's
the
way
I
see
it
anyways

Pros
and
Cons
Everything
contained
in
this
web
site
is
strictly
the
opinion(s
of
the
author(s
If
you've
enjoyed
it
I
am
responsible
If
not
let's
get
the
jerk
who
is
He
should
be
easy
to
catch
just
look
for
exhaust
from
an
SUV
and
a
trail
of
dead
baby
seals
All
that
knuckle-dragging's
got
to
slow
him
down
