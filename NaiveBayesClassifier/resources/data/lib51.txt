McCain
To
Suspend
Campaign
In
Order
to
Rescue
Campaign
In
a
dramatic
move
John
McCain
announced
today
that
he
was
going
to
suspend
his
campaign
in
a
last
ditch
effort
to
save
his
campaign
McCain
called
upon
Barack
Obama
to
honor
his
state
of
emergency
and
also
suspend
campaigning
but
doubted
that
Obama
would
do
so
because
Obama
failed
to
put
country
first
and
also
McCain
said
because
Obama
is
an
Arab
terrorist
And
a
fine
decent
family
man
with
whom
I
have
disagreements
he
added
And
a
crazy
Muslim
McCain's
campaign
has
been
described
by
critics
and
supporters
alike
as
a
total
disaster
Others
would
continue
their
campaigns
under
these
conditions
but
that's
not
what
a
maverick
would
do
McCain
told
reporters
This
is
why
I'm
not
popular
in
Washington
Others
disagreed
saying
McCain
was
not
popular
in
Washington
because
of
his
unsightly
nose
hairs
and
what
some
called
his
increasingly
uncontrollable
jowls
among
other
things
McCain
reiterated
his
latest
campaign
slogan
saying
that
he
was
not
afraid
to
fight
and
that
America
needs
a
real
fighter
right
now
but
that
it
takes
a
real
fighter
to
stop
fighting
because
sometimes
not
fighting
is
more
effective
fighting
than
actually
fighting
At
that
point
aides
grabbed
McCain
and
threw
him
headfirst
into
a
waiting
limousine
Supporters
applauded
McCain's
bold
choice
saying
that
the
candidate
needed
to
act
because
things
looked
so
dire
He's
not
running
for
Miss
Congeniality
said
supporter
John
Gaffney
of
Ohio
Although
I
can
understand
that
to
some
outsiders
it
looks
that
way

Twittering
the

Twitter
check

out
there
are
some

Paulson
Seen
on
Unidentified
Tropical
Island
Surrounded
by
Girls
Drinks
Billions
of
Dollars
Anonymous
tipsters
claimed
to
have
spotted
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
Henry
Paulson
earlier
today
on
a
secluded
tropical
island
The
FBI
confirmed
today
that
Paulson
left
the
country
early
yesterday
afternoon
with
what
JetBlue
Airlines
called
countless
heavy
fully
stuffed
duffel
bags
There
were
so
many
duffel
bags
that
Paulson
paid
thousands
of
dollars
in
excess
luggage
charges
without
batting
an
eyelash
a
JetBlue
Airline
official
said
The
White
House
hastily
released
a
statement
Sunday
afternoon
saying
that
Paulson
had
taken
a
brief
vacation
and
claimed
that
mobilization
of
a
vast
number
of
Air
Force
search
jets
over
the
entire
Pacific
was
just
a
military
exercise
Nonetheless
an
unusual
number
of
comings
and
goings
at
the
White
House
and
on
Capitol
Hill
conveyed
an
air
of
panic
An
anonymous
source
claimed
that
Paulson
had
left
a
note
in
which
he
stated
that
he
had
concluded
that
the
American
economy
is
no
longer
viable
I
am
going
to
make
my
own
President
Bush
refused
to
confirm
that
such
a
note
existed
saying
only
that
on
Sunday
he
rarely
reads
but
that
he
would
check
his
desk
first
thing
Monday
Lawmakers
were
putting
together
what
they
called
an
emergency
emergency
350
billion
replacement
bill
which
they
promised
would
include
even
more
oversight
This
time
we're
using
electronic
monitoring
promised
Rep
Barney
Frank
In
other
news
an
unidentified
bidder
purchased
the
countries
of
Mauritius
Belize
and
Tahiti
as
what
he
called
second
homes

Palin
Does
Uncanny
Tina
Fey
Impersonation
At
Veep
Debate
Sarah
Palin
plagued
by
polls
indicating
her
dropping
popularity
and
interviews
with
Katie
Couric
where
she
was
so
beleagured
that
she
made
Dan
Quayle
look
brilliant
by
comparison
did
an
impression
of
comedian
Tina
Fey
impersonating
Sarah
Palin
at
last
night's
Vice
Presidential
debate
so
that
she
could
be
even
more
folksier
and
plain
spoken
Palin
explained
her
affinity
for
Fey
who
now
regularly
returns
to
Saturday
Night
Live
to
play
Palin
You
know
what
I
like
about
Tina
Palin
said
smiling
and
winking
at
reporters
She's
a
mav-rick
you
betcha
Palin
then
extended
her
middle
fingers
and
thumbs
pretending
her
hands
were
guns
and
said
pyeuw
pyeuw
while
making
shooting
gestures
at
the
corners
of
the
room
Tina
Fey
had
done
the
same
thing
last
Saturday
on
NBC
but
used
her
forefingers
I
think
middle
fingers
are
more
direct
explained
Palin
It's
more
the
John
McCain
way
Viewers
were
impressed
with
Palin's
performance
at
the
debate
some
remarking
how
awestruck
they
were
at
the
vitality
of
Palin's
impersonation
She
really
captured
Tina
Fey
said
one
viewer
an
undecided
voter
from
Allegheny
Pa
I'm
thinking
of
voting
for
her
During
last
night's
debate
Palin
answered
questions
on
topics
ranging
from
the
bailout
of
the
domestic
economy
and
U.S
military
intervention
overseas
by
repeatedly
saying
Energy
and
Mav-rick
dontcha
know
and
winking
at
the
camera
Some
viewers
were
not
impressed
by
Palin's
performance
however
She
didn't
seem
to
really
be
answering
the
questions
said
Floyd
McGilla
of
Spitzen
Montana
I
think
she
need
some
of
Tina
fey's
writers

Voodoo
Economics
To
Be
Replaced
By
Cocktail
Party
Napkin
Economics
The
White
House
House
Democrats
and
recalcitrant
Republicans
searched
vainly
this
weekend
for
a
meme
to
replace
voodoo
economics
the
Ronald
Reagan
policy
which
has
ravaged
the
American
economy
bringing
on
the
greatest
economic
crisis
since
the
Great
Depression
Democrats
and
the
Treasury
Department
along
with
reluctant
rank-and-file
Republicans
settled
on
a
plan
hastily
sketched
out
on
a
cocktail
party
napkin
pdf
at
3:00
a.m
Saturday
night
as
an
adequate
substitute
We
did
it
with
virtually
no
thought
said
Secretary
Paulson
and
Barney
Frank
who
said
that
reaching
an
agreement
was
more
important
than
vetting
the
plan
upon
which
everyone
was
agreeing
We
have
to
restore
confidence
in
the
markets
they
said
John
McCain
parachuted
into
the
talks
on
Thursday
where
he
sat
unable
to
free
himself
from
his
canopy
as
GOP
Republicans
floated
a
new
plan
Initially
we
were
intent
on
switching
from
voodoo
to
witch
doctor
economics
said
House
Minority
Leader
John
Boehner
explaining
the
thinking
of
some
Republicans
But
some
thought
that
too
similar
an
economic
philosophy
Another
Republican
explained
GOP
reticence
to
sign
onto
a
bailout
plan
We're
really
uncomfortable
with
giving
away
taxpayer
money
unless
it's
to
prescription
drug
companies
or
the
oil
industry
said
Rep
Wayne
Tasso
The
fact
is
this
shows
that
voodoo
economics
is
a
disaster
just
like
I
said
said
George
H.W
Bush
who
coined
the
phrase
to
describe
Reagonomics
economics
based
on
Reagan's
belief
that
giving
everything
to
the
rich
would
fill
the
coffers
of
the
poor
I
knew
Reagonomics
was
bad
in
1978
but
it
took
my
son
to
prove
how
much
it
really
sucks

Bush
To
Put
FEMA
in
Charge
of
Wall
Street
Rescue
President
Bush
compounded
widespread
concern
about
a
domestic
economy
on
the
verge
of
collapse
today
when
he
announced
that
FEMA
would
coordinate
the
700
billion
dollar
bailout
of
Wall
Street
We
have
our
best
people
on
it
Bush
insisted
causing
the
market
to
slide
two
thousand
points
late
this
morning
Bush
and
his
staff
expressed
surprise
that
Adminstration
assurances
have
done
little
to
buoy
confidence
in
the
economy
None
of
the
folks
in
charge
of
the
bailout
ever
worked
with
horses
or
anything
said
a
perplexed
White
House
staffer
Circumstances
on
Wall
Street
remained
dire
today
Thousands
of
traders
and
bankers
have
been
without
money
gold
ingots
or
economic
power
for
almost
a
week
now
and
conditions
in
hastily
constructed
trailer
banks
have
been
horrible
There
are
hardly
any
bathroom
attendants
here
at
all
complained
one
temporary
resident
Preston
Brunswick
III
a
complex
derivatives
trader
who
barely
cleared
a
million
last
year
Compounding
the
crisis
trucks
full
of
relief
money
have
been
mysteriously
stalled
in
Alabama
and
FEMA
officials
were
at
a
loss
to
explain
why
it
was
so
hard
to
get
the
Benjamins
to
New
York
where
they
are
so
desperately
needed
We
need
that
money
now
We're
barely
able
to
expense
out
our
lunches
exclaimed
worried
A.I.G
executive
Gwen
Driscoll
Driscoll
fretted
that
her
corporate
American
Express
Platinum
card
was
being
strained
to
the
breaking
point
Meanwhile
Republicans
warned
that
the
allegedly
Democratic-controlled
Congress
would
take
too
much
time
debating
a
relief
bill
We
need
a
lack
of
oversight
and
we
need
it
now
said
Treasury
Secretary
Henry
Paulson
Before

a

Sarah
Palin
Thoroughly
Vetted
By
Jamie
Spears
Mom
McCain
Campaign
Says
John
McCain's
campaign
vigorously
denied
accusations
that
it
had
not
thoroughly
vetted
McCain's
vice
presidential
pick
Governor
Sarah
Palin
saying
she
had
been
vetted
and
raked
over
the
coals
by
a
trusted
campaign
advisor
That
advisor
was
Lynn
Spears
Jamie
and
Britney
Spears
mother
Spears
gave
Palin
two
pacifiers
up
a
spokesman
for
the
McCain
campaign
said
today
Spears
was
selected
to
vet
Palin
because
she
is
an
authority
on
mothering
and
the
author
of
numerous
books
on
the
subject
including
Through
The
Storm
How
To
Raise
Good
Christian
Girls
She
is
also
an
authority
on
raising
good
Christian
grandchildren
as
quickly
as
possible
says
Dr
Ian
Fesslhoff
an
expert
on
parenting
experts
Spears
confirmed
that
she
okayed
Palin
for
the
Veep
spot
on
the
McCain
ticket
I
especially
approved
of
Palin's
strong
religious
and
moral
stances
on
abortion
and
abstinence-only
policies
toward
sex
education
she
said
As
a
mom
she
also
felt
the
timing
of
Palin's
placement
on
the
ticket
was
key
There's
no
better
time
to
run
for
office
than
when
you
have
a
five-month-old
with
special
needs
and
a
teenage
daughter
with
baby
number
two
on
the
way
In
a
campaign
appearance
late
today
Senator
McCain
declined
to
comment
on
the
recent
revelation
that
Palin's
17-year-old
daughter
Bristol
is
five
months
pregnant
or
the
rumor
that
Gov
Palin's
infant
son
is
really
also
Bristol's
child
except
to
say
that
he
looks
forward
to
presiding
over
a
nation
of
young
people
Young
people
caring
for
much
younger
people
noted

Fesslhoff

the
familiar
trill
of
my
iPhone
announcing
the
arrival
of
a
text
message
It
actually
woke
me
up
I
was
a
little
angry
Who
the
hell
is
texting
me
at
3:30
in
the
morning
I
get
up
which
wakes
up
my
wife
What
the
hell
is
going
on
It's
Barack
Obama
I
tell
her
Go
back
to

both
like
the
pick

about
the
choice

certainly
going
to
be

Satire
of
Fear
Scares
Crap
Out
Of
Everyone
A
satiric
drawing
meant
to
make
fun
of
all
the
things
that
scare
poorly
informed
rabidly
ignorant
Americans
about
Barack
Obama
has
terrified
Barack
Obama's
campaign
team
who
are
concerned
that
it
will
scare
poorly
informed
rabidly
ignorant
Americans
about
Barack
Obama
This
drawing
said
a
campaign
staffer
will
scare
people
who
are
already
good
and
god
damned
scared
of
Obama
She
said
that
she
and
the
Obama
campaign
were
frightened
to
death
of
the
awful
frightful
picture
The
drawing
appeared
on
the
cover
of
the
latest
New
Yorker
magazine
The
drawing
depicts
Obama
wearing
a
Moslem
outfit
in
front
of
a
picture
of
Osama
bin
Laden
hanging
in
Obama's
living
room
bumping
fists
with
his
terrorist
wife
who
is
wearing
a
