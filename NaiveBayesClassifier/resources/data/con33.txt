The

that

its

Today

is
threatened
by

America

by

illusive
outside

Concepts
are
turned
upside

War

Peace
Offense
becomes
a

In
the
words
of
President

Against
this
kind
of
enemy
there
is
only
one
effective
response
We

stay

The

A

justify
in

Israeli

for
hours
in

with

visibility
correctly
reported
the

Did
Rupert

Buy
Trent
Lott
Jo
Becker
In
the
fall
of
2003
a
piece
of
Rupert
Murdoch's
sprawling
media
empire
was
in
jeopardy
Congress
was
on
the
verge
of
limiting
any
company
from
owning
local
television
stations
that
reached
more
than
35
percent
of
American
homes
Mr
Murdoch's
Fox
stations
reached
nearly
39
percent
meaning
he
would
have
to
sell
some
A
strike
force
of
Mr
Murdoch's
lobbyists
joined
other
media
companies
in
working
on
the
issue
The
White
House
backed
the
industry
and
in
a
late-night
meeting
just
before
Thanksgiving
Congressional
leaders
agreed
to
raise
the
limit
to
39
percent
One
leader
of
the
Congressional
movement
to
limit
ownership
was
Senator
Trent
Lott
Republican
of
Mississippi
But
in
the
end
he
too
agreed
to
the
compromise
It
turns
out
he
had
a
business
connection
to
Mr
Murdoch
Months
before
HarperCollins
Mr
Murdoch's

had
signed

The

of

and
the
Christian
Right
Has
the
War
on
Terror
Merged
With
War
on
the
Unborn
Al
Bawaba
Amman
My
good
friend
Dr
Paul
Gottfried
of
Elizabethtown
College
in
Pennsylvania
goes
a
long
way
toward
explaining
the
real
agenda
of
the
American
Christian
Right
in
his
latest
effort
for
The
American
Conservative
entitled
The
Giuliani-Driven
Christians
Dr
Gottfried
notes
that
Quinnipiac
polls
indicate
Giuliani's
present
status
as
the
most
popular
Presidential
candidate
among
Protestant
evangelicals
and
that
Hizzoner's
present
lead
in
the
polls
in
key
swing
states
especially
Florida
is
directly
attributable
to
white
Evangelical
voters
The
Washington
Post
has
chimed
in
reporting
in
February
that
Giuliani
is
surging
among
white
Evangelicals
The
implications
of
this
burgeoning
phenomenon
are
as
striking
as
they
are
demonically
draconian
Hizzoner
after
all
is
a
leading
advocate
of
abortion-on-demand
even
as
he
chides
Islamic
societies
in
Fox
News-sponsored
Presidential
debates
for
attitudes
and
policies
allegedly
detrimental
to
the
rights
and
dignity
of
women
And
aside
from
the
Big
Apple
Mayor's
publicized
liabilities
in
personal
life
and
conduct
it
seems
incredible
to
the
point
of
the
outrageously
satirical
to
contemplate
Giuliani's
adulation
by
the
likes
of
Religious
Right
mogul
Cal
Thomas
given
Hizzoner's
strident
support
of
the
militant
homosexual
rights
constituency
That
support
symbolically
expressed
by
Rudy's
past
personal
appearance
in
Costume
Drag
in
New
York
for
a
Gay
Pride
parade
suggests
that
all
things
are
now
possible
in
the
increasingly
comfortable
alliance
of
the
Christian
Right
with
the
globalist
Rockefeller
wing
of
the
Republican
Party

Giuliani
campaign

Sometimes
it
really
is
déj
vu
all
over
again
Those
who
have
hoped
for
a
peaceful
resolution
of
the
outstanding
issues
between
the
United
States
and
Iran
must
have
been
discouraged
to
watch
the
June
5
Republican
presidential
candidates
debate
With
the
honorable
exception
of
Ron
Paul
the
Republicans
lined
up
firmly
in
support
of
a
policy
to
stop
Iran's
acquisition
of
a
nuclear
weapon
using
whatever
means
are
necessary
to
do
so
including
the
American
nuclear
arsenal
All
except
Paul
derided
Iran
as
the
main
source
of
terrorism
in
the
world
Rudy
Giuliani
repeated
the
now
familiar
you
shouldn't
take
any
options
off
the
table
when
asked
about
the
possible
use
of
nuclear
weapons
against
Iran
and
stated
that
he
even
opposes
Iran's
acquisition
of
nuclear
power
Duncan
Hunter
said
flatly
that
he
would
authorize
the
use
of
tactical
nuclear
weapons
against
Iran
The
top
Republican
candidates
united
in
their
view
that
the
Democrats
would
be
soft
on
the
issue
of
Iran
a
charge
that
lacks
validity
as
the
leading
Democratic
candidates
for
president
are
as
bellicose
as
the
Republicans
when
it
comes
to
Tehran's
ambitions

are

Rudy
Giuliani's
now
infamous
exchange
with
Ron
Paul
in
the
Fox-sponsored
Republican
Presidential
debate
revealed
the
former's
inadvertent
or
willful
ignorance
of
the
obvious
connection
between
American
foreign
policy
and
insidious
blowback
both
in
the
Middle
East
and
elsewhere
My
recent
radio
guest
on
the
Republic
Broadcasting
Network
Dr
Jerome
Corsi
of
both
Human
Events
and
WorldNetDaily
displayed
a
similar
discomfort
with
acknowledging
the
connection
between
actions
of
the
United
States
Government
around
the
world
and
predictable
acts
of
retaliation
and
retribution
on
the
part
of
past
recipients
of
these
American
military
and
covert
intelligence
operations
Dr
Corsi
rightly
pointed
out
that
the
latter
phenomenon
is
not
justified
by
the
former
But
neither
did
Ron
Paul
indicate
such
either
in
the
Fox
Presidential
debates
or
in
any
other
forum
in
which
the
Texas
Congressman
has
participated
over
the
course
of
many
years

The
war
in
Iraq
is
lost
This
fact
is
widely
recognized
by
American
military
officers
and
has
been
recently
expressed
forcefully
by
Lt
Gen
Ricardo
Sanchez
the
commander
of
US
forces
in
Iraq
during
the
first
year
of
the
attempted
occupation
Winning
is
no
longer
an
option
Our
best
hope
Gen
Sanchez
says
is
to
stave
off
defeat
and
that
requires
more
intelligence
and
leadership
than
Gen
Sanchez
sees
in
the
entirety
of
our
national
political
leadership
I
am
absolutely
convinced
that
America
has
a
crisis
in
leadership
at
this
time

Patrick
Cockburn

Several
thousand
Turkish
troops
crossed
into
northern
Iraq
in
pursuit
of
Kurdish
guerrillas
early
yesterday
The
incursion
though
limited
in
scope
gives
the
crisis
in
Iraq
a
new
twist
It
is
not
a
major
offensive
and
the
number
of
troops
is
not
in
the
tens
of
thousands
said
an
official
in
south-east
Turkey
where
there
has
recently
been
an
upsurge
in
activity
by
the
Kurdistan
Workers
Party
PKK
Turkish
Kurd
guerrillas
Nevertheless
the
US
will
be
worried
that
its
entanglement
in
Iraq
is
about
to
become
even
more
complicated
if
American
troops
and
aircraft
are
asked
to
counter
even
a
limited
Turkish
assault

has
confimed
that
the
White
House
has
been
plotting
a
course
based
on
a
major
military
roadmap
in
the
Middle
East
Central
Asia
and
East
Africa
that
would
start
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
and
end
with
Iran
Clark
has
stated
that
after
Afghanistan
seven
additional
nations
were
on
the
the
Pentagon's
list
to
be
attacked
and
invaded
over
a
five-year
period
Iraq
Syria
Lebanon
Libya
Somalia
Sudan
and
finally
Iran
The
geographic
boundaries
for
these
wars
all
fall
within
the
military
jurisdiction
of
United
States
Central
Command
CENTCOM
This
five-year
period
began
with
the
invasion
of
Iraq
in
mid-2003
and
if
the
American
former
Supreme
Allied
Commander
of
NATO
in
Europe
is
correct
it
should
end
approximately
in
mid-2008
or
the
last
war
could
be
initiated
by
this
point
in
time
It
should
be
noted
that
the
second
presidential
term
of
George
W
Bush
Jr
ends
in
January
of
2009
Is
it
possible
that
in
2001
when
the
Pentagon
outlined
this
military
roadmap
that
the
re-election
of
President
Bush
Jr
to
a
second
term
in
office
in
2005
had
already
been
envisaged
in
relation
to
these
war
plans

Why
I
Am
Leaving
the
Democratic
Party
Dear
Democratic
Congress
Hello
my
name
is
Cindy
Sheehan
and
my
son
Casey
Sheehan
was
killed
on
April
04
2004
in
Sadr
City
Baghdad
Iraq
He
was
killed
when
the
Republicans
still
were
in
control
of
Congress
Naively
I
set
off
on
my
tireless
campaign
calling
on
Congress
to
rescind
George's
authority
to
wage
his
war
of
terror
while
asking
him
for
what
noble
cause
did
Casey
and
thousands
of
other
have
to
die
Now
with
Democrats
in
control
of
Congress
I
have
lost
my
optimistic
naivet
and
have
become
cynically
pessimistic
as
I
see
you

The

has
admitted
that
covert

an
aggressive
nature
were
applied
against

was

created
in

2006
integrated
by
officials
from

the
State
Department
the

and
the
Treasury
Department
had
a
mandate
to
destabilize
Syria

Iran
and
bring

The
committee
the
Iran-Syria
Policy
and
Operations
Group
ISOG
met
weekly
throughout
much
of
2006
to
coordinate
actions
such
as
curtailing
Iran's
access
to
credit
and
banking
institutions
organizing
the
sale
of
military
equipment
to
Iran's
neighbors
and
supporting

ISOG
had
also
been
providing
undercover
assistance
to
Iranian
opposition
groups
and
dissidents
The
group's
propaganda
ploy
consisted
in
feeding
disinformation
into
the
news
chain
and
building
international

Exit
From
Iraq
Should
Be
Through
Iran
Lt
General
William
Odom
Yale
Global
Online
The
US
Congress
and
the
White
House
have
been
at
odds
over
the
withdrawal
of
US
troops
from
Iraq
for
months
but
brief
historical
reflection
suggests
that
the
only
option
left
for
Washington
is
to
link
forces
with
Iran
Starting
in
the
mid-1950s
the
US
maintained
stability
in
the
Middle
East
and
the
Persian
Gulf
by
establishing
bilateral
relationships
with
Israel
Iran
and
Saudi
Arabia
and
preventing
any
one
country
from
overwhelming
another
Even
after
the
Iranian
Revolution
in
1979
presidents
recognized
that
restoring
ties
with
Tehran
could
minimize
US
military
costs
George
W
Bush
however
disrupted
the
delicate
balance
with
the
invasion
of
Iraq
Unless
the
US
can
convince
Iran
to
play
a
cooperative
role
the
chaos
in
Iraq
will
spread
to
neighboring
countries
In
this
article
William
Odom
a
former
director
of
the
US
National
Security
Agency
contends
that
a
rapprochement
with
Iran
is
the
key
to
restoring
regional
stability
as
the
US
withdraws
from
Iraq
However
the
US
must
follow
up
on
Monday's
meeting
with
Iran
in
Baghdad
and
abandon
its
current
all
sticks
policy
for
stopping
Tehran's
nuclear-weapons
program
Iran
cannot
help
but
realize
that
its
influence
in
Iraq
faces
limits
when
US
troops
leave
and
Washington
must
take
advantage
of
many
mutual
goals
to
establish
a
sustainable
relationship
with
Iran
and
restore
stability
throughout
the
Middle
East
