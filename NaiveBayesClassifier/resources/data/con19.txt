What
You
See
Is
What
You
Get
As
a
young
woman
I
remember
contemplating
men
I
would
date
One
might
be
charming
and
fun
but
irresponsible
Another
might
be
intelligent
and
witty
yet
not
treat
me
very
well
A
third
could
have
a
fabulous
personality
though
not
share
some
of
the
same
life
goals
that
I
did
But
when
I
was
young
I
wouldn't
think
Which
do
I
prefer
Would
my
life
be
superior
with
Tom
Dick
or
Harry
No
I'd
say
to
myself
I'll
change
him
As
our
relationship
became
permanent
I'd
train
him
to
be
more
responsible
Or
improve
his
care
for
me
Or
alter
his
personal
goals
It
never
works
that
way
though
does
it
Oh
I'm
not
saying
that
people
can't
change
They
can
and
they
do
They
do
it
however
because
they
decide
that
they
wish
to
change
Not
because
someone
else
has
judged
that
they
should
transform
And
so
we
come
to
this
election
and
our
two
candidates
Fouad
Ajami
a
Johns
Hopkins
professor
and
a
child
of
the
Middle
East

the
nature
of
the
crowds
that
gather
to
hear
Senator
Obama
speak

Promises
to
Keep
Knowing
if
a
candidate
will
live
up
to
their
campaign
promises
is
impossible
We
can
only
find
out
after
the
election
is
over
Yet
we
can
know
about
their
words
and
acts
prior
to
the
election
Here
is
Campbell
Brown's
view
on
a
promise
about
campaign
financing
You
may
have
heard
that
Wednesday
night
Barack
Obama
will
be
on
five
different
TV
networks
speaking
directly
to
the
American
people
He
bought
30
minutes
of
airtime
from
the
different
networks
a
very
expensive
purchase
But
hey
he
can
afford
it
Barack
Obama
is
loaded
way
more
loaded
than
John
McCain
way
more
loaded
than
any
presidential
candidate
has
ever
been
at
this
stage
of
the
campaign
Just
to
throw
a
number
out
He
has
raised
well
over
600
million
since
the
start
of
his
campaign
close
to
what
George
Bush
and
John
Kerry
raised
combined
in
2004
Without
question
Obama
has
set
the
bar
at
new
height
with
a
truly
staggering
sum
of
cash
And
that
is
why
as
we
approach
this
November
it
is
worth
reminding
ourselves
what
Barack
Obama
said
last
November
One
year
ago
he
made
a
promise
He
pledged
to
accept
public
financing
and
to
work
with
the
Republican
nominee
to
ensure
that
they
both
operated
within
those
limits
Then
it
became
clear
to
Sen
Obama
and
his
campaign
that
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
raise
on
his
own
far
more
cash
than
he
would
get
with
public
financing
So
Obama
went
back
on
his
word

The
Brainiac
What
does
a
former
Ms
Magazine
editor
and
Democrat
think
about
Sarah
Palin
This
Sarah
Palin
is
very
smart
I'm
a
Democrat
but
I've
worked
as
a
consultant
with
the
McCain
campaign
since
shortly
after
Palin's
nomination
Last
week
there
was
the
thought
that
as
a
former
editor-in-chief
of
Ms
magazine
as
well
as
a
feminist
activist
in
my
pre-journalism
days
I
might
be
helpful
in
contributing
to
a
speech
that
Palin
had
long
wanted
to
give
on
women's
rights
Now
by
smart
I
don't
refer
to
a
person
who
is
wily
or
calculating
or
nimble
in
the
way
of
certain
talented
athletes
who
we
admire
but
suspect
don't
really
have
serious
brains
in
their
skulls
I
mean
instead
a
mind
that
is
thoughtful
curious
with
a
discernable
pattern
of
associative
thinking
and
insight
Palin
asks
questions
and
probes
linkages
and
logic
that
bring
to
mind
a
quirky
law
professor
I
once
had
Palin
is
more
than
a
quick
study
I'd
heard
rumors
around
the
campaign
of
her
photographic
memory
and
frankly
I
watched
it
in
action
She
sees
She
processes
She
questions
and
only
then
she
acts
What
is
often
called
her
confidence
is
actually
a
rarity
in
national
politics
I
saw
a
woman
who
knows
exactly
who
she
is

Au
Revoir
One
of
my
liberal
friends
sends
out
alerts
every
few
days
about
how
many
big
city
newspapers
have
endorsed
Obama
He
is
correct
that
the
numbers
are
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
Obama
over
McCain
On
the
other
hand
the
editors
endorsing
Obama
seem
to
be
the
same
folks
who
are
going
out
of
business
I'm
sure
there's
a
message
there
just
not
exactly
certain
what
it
is
Here
is
one
reader's
personal
story
Karen
Avrech
PhD
and
wife
of
screenwriter
Robert
Avrech
both
Orthodox
Jews
finally
says
enough
to
the
New
York
Times
I
have
subscribed
to
your
newspaper
for
many
years
but
I
can
no
longer
trust
your
news
reportage
as
unbiased
since
your
radical
leftist
politics
permeate
every
aspect
of
your
newspaper
from
fashion
to
book
reviews
The
final
straw
was
the
slanderous
mean
spirited
front
page
article
on
Cindy
McCain
Every
day
I
open
your
paper
to
the
so-called
corrections
which
are
really
more
apologies
for
sloppy
journalism
that
has
omitted
or
distorted
information
to
suit
the
viewpoint
of
your
arch
leftist
reporters
I
just
can't
read
your
newspaper
with
good
conscious
anymore
You
distort
science
articles
on
global
warming
justify
Islamic
terror
libel
the
State
of
Israel
glorify
the
death
cult
society
of
the
Palestinians
and
resort
to
character
assassination
in
the
current
election
I
can
no
longer
subscribe
to
your
paper
so
please
cancel
my
subscription
Some
of
you
may
think
Heh
What
does
the
New
York
Times
care
about
one
biased
right-wing
religious
Jew
Well
These
days
it's
looking
as
if
the
Times
can
use
every
reader
they
can

Standing
Up
for
Freedom
One
of
the
miracles
of
America
is
our
diversity
as
a
people
Go
to
France
Russia
or
Japan
and
most
of
the
people
are
of
uh
French
Russian
or
Japanese
origin
Here
We
are
from
everywhere
We're
German
Irish
English
Italian
and
Polish
We're
Mexican
Puerto
Rican
and
Cuban
We're
Brazilian
Jamaican
Haitian
Somalian
Ethiopian
and
Nigerian
We're
Chinese
Vietnamese
Indian
and
Japanese
We're
native
Americans
Our
recent
immigrants
and
our
ancestors
came
here
for
the
freedoms
that
our
nation
offered
They
brought
their
own
cultures
and
histories
weaving
them
together
with
the
opportunities
available
One
of
those
immigrants
so
proud
to
be
an
American
is
Tito
Munoz
Tito
the
Builder
if
you
will
Tito
introduced
Sarah
Palin
on
the
stump
today
in
Virginia
I
have
so
much
things
to
say
about
this
great
country
I
have
so
much
things
that
I
want
to
say
about
free
enterprise
and
hard
work
Munoz
said
Everything
we
stand
for
is
in
danger
by
higher
taxes
and
less
freedom
Everything
we
stand
for
is
made
stronger
by
people
like
you
like
John
McCain
and
Sarah
Palin
This
country
has
given
me
so
much
but
I
have
not
been
given
much
time
to
do
my
job
My
job
today
is
to
stand
before
you
to
stand
up
for
freedom
Please
play
the
video
at
the
link
with
Tito's
short
introduction
See
what
continues
to
make
our
nation
truly
one
of
a
kind
in
the
world
Listen
to
why
Tito
wants
to
preserve
our
values
and
our
freedoms
You
too
can
stand
up
for
freedom

Spooky
Art
One
man's
spooky
art
is
another
man's
hate
crime
I
know
if
we
had
done
it
with
Barack
Obama
people
would've
probably
thrown
things
through
our
windows
Morrisette
said
Gee
you
think
Instead
when
it's
a
Republican
woman
getting
lynched
in
effigy
it
suddenly
becomes
art
and
good
clean
fun
Maybe
we
should
start
talking
about
the
latent
misogyny
of
the
Left
and
the
drooling
bigots
of
their
enclaves
After
all
if
this
had
been
an
effigy
of
Obama
in
say
Alabama
we'd
certainly
not
be
hearing
about
Halloween
and
spooky
art
but
instead
how
racist
Obama's
opponents
are

The
Atlantic
RIP
For
many
years
The
Atlantic
was
my
favorite
magazine
I
touted
it
to
all
my
friends
left
and
right
irrespective
of
interests
I
told
everyone
that
The
Atlantic
covered
a
wide
range
of
topics
that
the
writing
was
top-notch
and
that
the
viewpoints
were
terrifically
diverse
Every
month
at
least
one
article
and
often
several
educated
enlightened
amused
and
delighted
me
I
still
recall
reading
this
article
by
Mark
Bowden
about
Saddam
Hussein
Tales
of
the
Tyrant
What
tales
they
were
When
our
country
balanced
on
the
decision
as
to
whether
war
with
Iraq
was
the
correct
course
or
not
Bowden's
reporting
remained
in
my
mind
Ultimately
I
believed
that
no
matter
what
else
taking
out
this
tyrant
would
aid
the
world
My
copy
of
that
month's
Atlantic
remains
on
a
shelf
in
my
bedroom
Somehow
someway
however
something
happened
at
the
magazine
It
changed

Plain
English
Do
you
have
difficulty
at
times
sorting
out
what
economists
are
trying
to
convey
I
sure
do
Graphs
charts
equations
and
references
to
theories
of
which
I
have
only
a
slim
understanding
Sometimes
I
feel
as
if
I
come
away
more
confused
than
when
I
arrived
Professor
Greg
Mankiw
is
a
Harvard
economist
He'd
probably
get
drummed
out
of
the
trade
if
he
didn't
offer
an
array
of
charts
and
technical
computations
within
his
discussion
of
tax
plans
Still
Professor
Mankiw
realizes
that
we
the
uninitiated
that
would
be
yours
truly
look
at
all
this
like
Plato's
Republic
in
the
original
Greek
Thus
Mankiw
kindly
explains
in
plain
English
what
varying
tax
plans
mean
in

Honest
Liberals
They
admit
that
the
press
is
fawning
over
Obama
Hear
from
Bob
Kerrey
the
former
Senator
from
Nebraska
Kerrey
who's
now
president
of
The
New
School
claimed
that
the
big
unreported
story
of
the
election
cycle
is
the
tremendous
spending
advantage
Obama's
got
If
everything
else
is
equal
and
it's
not
equal
in
this
race
but
if
everything
else
is
equal
McCain
hasn't
got
a
chance
Asked
why
he
thinks
the
story
isn't
getting
adequate
coverage
he
responded
There's
a
liberal
bias
There's
a
preference
for
Obama
and
it's
getting
underreported
as
a
result
Then
Kerrey
got
specific
If
this
thing
was
running
the
other
way
if
Obama
was
taking
the
public
money
and
McCain
had
opted
out
and
raised
150
million
in
September
do
you
think
The
New
York
Times
would
have
an
editorial
against
it
Do
you
think
any
of
their
columnists
do
you
think
Maureen
Dowd
or
Frank
Rich
would
write
anything
at
all
about
that
The
answer
is
yes
Actually
Dowd
has
mentioned
it
She
wrote
that
Obama
in
rejecting
public
financing
is
not
going
to
be
a
chump

What
We
Have
Learned
Sarah
Palin
teacher
And
what
she
teaches
us
is
not
pretty
There
does
not
seem
to
be
much
left
of
feminism
any
more
Of
course
feminists
once
gave
liberal
pro-choice
Bill
Clinton
a
pass
for
his
serial
womanizing
of
vulnerable
subordinates
and
Oval
Office
antics
with
a
young
female
intern
But
they
gave
the
game
away
entirely
when
they
went
after
Gov
Palin
for
her
looks
accent
pregnancies
and
religion
culminating
in
assessments
of
her
from
being
no
real
woman
at
all
to
an
ingrate
piggy-backing
on
the
pioneer
work
of
self-acclaimed
mavericks
like
themselves
Feminism
it
turns
out
is
no
longer
about
equal
opportunity
and
equal
compensation
but
in
fact
little
more
than
a
strain
of
contemporary
elitist
identity
politics
and
support
for
unquestioned
abortion
Had
Gov
Sarah
Palin
just
been
a
mother
of
a
single
child
at
Vassar
rather
than
of
five
in
Alaska
married
to
a
novelist
rather
than
a
snow-machiner
an
advocate
of
pro-choice
who
shot
pictures
of
Alaskan
ferns
rather
than
shot
moose
feminists
would
have
hailed
her
as
a
principled
kindred
soul
and
trumpeted
her
struggles
against
Alaskan
male
grandees
So
there
was
something
creepy
about
droves
of
irate
women
in
lock-step
blasting
Sarah
Palin
from
the
corridors
of
New
York
and
Washington
when
most
of
them
were
the
recipients
of
the
traditional
spoils
of
either
family
connections
inherited
money
or
the
advantages
that
accrue
from
insider
power
marriages
Indeed
very
few
of
Palin's
critics
on
their
own
could
have
emerged
from
a
small-town
in
Alaska
with
an
intact
marriage
and
five
children
to
run
the
state
of
Alaska
