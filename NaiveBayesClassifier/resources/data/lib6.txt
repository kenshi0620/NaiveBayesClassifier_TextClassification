DEBATE
WINE=FUN
FUN
FUN
This
will
be
the
first
of
three--count
em
THREE
posts--coming
this
weekend
Tonight
I'll
share
a
few
thoughts
about
the
ongoing
debate
in
between
sips
of
tasty
wine
Enjoy
7:05-7:31
p.m
It's
obvious
that
the
debate
organizers
shoehorned
the
global
financial
crisis
and
the
Wall
Street
bailout
into
the
planned
debate
on
foreign
affairs
and
that
neither
candidate
had
enough
time
to
really
compose
their
thoughts
and
offer
anything
remotely
substantive
about
the
crisis
Neither
McCain
nor
Obama
are
at
their
best
here
although
I
do
think
I
know
the
moment
that
John
McCain
might
have
lost
Iowa
At
7:29
he
said
I
would
do
away
with
ethanol
subsidies
Great--there
goes
the
only
economic
incentive
for
living
in
Iowa
SIDEBAR
Tonight's
wine
is
a
lovely
Ironstone
California
Rose
circa
2007
A
nice
blend
of
a
Syrah
a
Cabernet
Sauvignon
and
hint
of
Reisling
Tasty
7:44
Senator
McCain
keeps
hammering
away
with
subtle
jabs
at
Senator
Obama's
lack
of
experience
by
suggesting
that
Obama
doesn't
know
the
difference
between
a
tactic
and
a
strategy
and
that
Obama
also
didn't
spend
any
real
time
in
his
foreign
affairs
subcommittee
taking
up
the
issues
of
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
So
far
Obama
has
deflected
most
of
the
jabs
well
but
he
looks
weary
and
a
bit
exasperated
McCain
is
the
one
that
supposedly
has
the
temper
but
I
wonder
if
Obama
isn't
about
to
slap
ol
Grandpa
in
the
mouth
Now
THAT
would
be
an
entertaining
debate
8:03
Moderator
Jim
Lehrer
marvels
that
each
candidate
is
even
on
their
allotted
time
Maybe
Lehrer
should
run
the
Wall
St
bailout
8:10
McCain
can't
pronounce
Ahmendijad
and
I
can't
spell
it
without
Googling
it
Iran
is
the
topic--both
agree
that
Iran
is
becoming
a
nuclear
threat
but
they
disagree
on
how
to
sanction
and
control
Iran
Senator
Obama
says
that
if
we
don't
alter
our
strategy
Iran
with
nukes
could
lead
to
a
Middle
East
arms
race
Hmmmm...something
I've
never
understood
is
why
it's
okay
for
Israel
Pakistan
and
India
to
have
tactical
nuclear
weapons
but
not
everyone
else
in
the
region
Don't
we
already
have
a
Middle
East
arms
race
8:14
For
the
94th
time
tonight
McCain
calls
Obama
either
naive
or
confused
or
suggests
he
doesn't
understand
I
wonder
what
the
talking
point
is
there
8:15
Things
are
finally
getting
heated
McCain
says
Obama
is
parsing
words
when
he
talking
about
preconditions
in
discussions
with
American
antagonists
like
Iran
Venezuela
and
Cuba
He
mentions
several
times
that
he's
been
a
friend
of
Henry
Kissenger
for
35
years
and
I
know
what
his
positions
are
and
he'd
be
very
interested
to
hear
Senator
Obama's
understanding
of
his
statements
Translation
I'm
old
and
if
I'm
president
me
and
my
old
Cold
War
buddies
are
going
show
you
whippersnappers
how
it's
really
done
To
be
honest
though
this
part
of
the
debate
is
the
weakest
Obama
has
looked
all
night--McCain
scored
some
points
8:21
Time
for
another
sip
of
wine
For
some
reason
it's
getting
harder
to
follow
the
debate
They're
talking
a
lot
about
Russia
and
the
Georgian
invasion
McCain
has
a
funny
line
about
how
he
looked
into
the
eyes
of
Vladimir
Putin
and
he
saw
a
K
a
G
and
a
B
I
wonder
how
that
will
play
in
Moscow
If
McCain
is
president
I
don't
think
there
will
be
a
whole
lot
of
glasnost
8:26
Another
question
goes
first
to
McCain
About
the
likelihood
of
another
terrorist
attack
like
9/11
This
should
be
a
strategic
debate
advantage
to
Obama
but
he
doesn't
seem
to
be
taking
full
advantage
of
it
By
the
way
is
reaching
out
to
Joe
Lieberman
really
reaching
across
the
aisle
He's
more
of
a
Republican
than
John
McCain
is
8:29
Obama
says
al-Qaeda
is
now
operating
in
sixty
countries
I
wonder
what
it's
like
to
start
up
an
al-Qaeda
cell
Is
it
like
opening
a
McDonald's
franchise
Yes
Ahmed
may
I
take
your
order
Hmmm
yes
praise
Allah
I
would
like
a
suitcase
nuke
an
IED
and
some
sarin
gas
to
go
Very
well
would
you
like
two
tickets
to
a
flight
school
with
that
Oh
no
thanks
that
will
be
all
Very
well
please
drive
up
to
the
next
window
and
pay
in
cash
There's
something
wrong
with
me
8:32
Obama
is
starting
to
regain
his
footing
a
bit
He's
making
a
strong
point
about
the
difficulty
of
pouring
so
many
troops
and
so
much
money
into
Iraq
thus
weakening
our
stature
and
ability
to
defend
around
the
world
I
wonder
if
McCain
will
Obama
doesn't
understand
again
8:34
Yes
McCain
says
it
again
Sigh
8:36
Will
this
debate
ever
freakin
end
It's
time
for
a
Klondike
bar
8:38
Oh
shit
it's
over
Did
they
hear
me
MY
TAKE
So
who
won
People
didn't
expect
quite
as
much
from
Obama
in
this
debate
as
they
did
from
the
foreign
policy
expert
McCain
As
a
result
what
I
would
consider
merely
a
passing
performance
from
Obama
on
the
foreign
policy
questions
is
being
treated
by
the
hoi
polloi
as
a
small
victory
What's
interesting
is
that
in
the
CBS
coverage
I
watched
I'll
pick
a
different
one
of
the
Big
Three
networks
to
watch
for
each
presidential
debate
the
100
uncommitted
voters
sequestered
in
the
MGM
Grand
in
Las
Vegas
sans
wine
apparently
were
much
more
impressed
with
Obama's
debate
performance
especially
on
the
question
of
Iraq
If
this
is
a
common
feeling
among
viewers
across
the
country
then
it
really
is
a
win
for
Obama
who
will
amp
up
the
momentum
his
campaign
has
picked
up
in
the
last
week
or
so
All
in
all
not
as
dry
a
debate
as
I
expected
but
nothing
super
juicy
either
On
to
Round
2
if
we
ever
sort
out
what
to
do
about
the
financial
crisis

Political
rant
with
much
swearing
I
CANNOT
FUCKING
STAND
THE
CONCEPT
THAT
JOHN
MCCAIN
AND
SARAH
PALIN
MIGHT
BE
OUR
NEXT
PRESIDENT
AND
VICE-PRESIDENT
ARE
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
SO
GODDAMN
STUPID
THAT
AFTER
THE
LAST
8
YEARS
OF
CHICANERY
SKULLDUGGERY
AND
JUST
PLAIN
TOO-STUPID-TO-LIVE
FUCKUPS
THAT
WE
WANT
TO
CONTINUE
WITH
MORE
OF
THE
SAME
OR
WORSE
SARAH
PALIN
IS
A
TWIT
JOHN
MCCAIN
IS
A
TOOL
I
have
tried
to
swear
off
all
news
for
the
past
few
weeks
but
people
will
insist
on
sharing
shit
with
me
SERIOUSLY
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
KNOW
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
HEAR
ONE
MORE
SPEECH
SOUND
BITE
COMEDY
ROUTINE
JOKE

OR

NOTE
IF
IT
IS
IN
ANY
WAY
RELATED
TO
OBAMA
BIDEN
MCCAIN
OR
PALIN
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
KNOW
Please
people
if
you
really
give
one
vague
shit
about
me
as
a
human
being
don't
share
anything
about
this
clusterfuck
with
me
Back
when
McCain
was
running
against
Du(m)bya
I
kinda
had
some
respect
for
him
especially
after
the
way
the
Bushies
and
Co
eviscerated
him
and
basically
declared
that
he
was
a
Viet
Cong
spy
just
waiting
to
slice
the
throats
of
American
babies
and
drink
their
hot
blood
while
it
was
spurting
from
their
carotids
slight
exaggeration
but
now
I
realize
the
error
of
my
ways
Mr
McCain
you
might
be
anally
gang-raped
by
a
bunch
of
brutal
ignorant
fucktards
but
you
don't
have
to
turn
around
with
their
semen
and
your
blood
running
down
the
backs
of
your
thighs
and
thank
them
for
the
experience
How
can
you
say
anything
positive
about
the
current
administration
after
the
brutal
hatchet
job
they
did
on
you
Yes
I
understand
that
you
have
to
be
able
to
work
with
them
but
the
way
you
praise
them
makes
me
physically
ill
Our
country's
standing
with
the
rest
of
the
world
is
at
an
all-time
low
and
we
collectively
as
American
citizens
have
the
opportunity
to
turn
that
image
around
But
I
am
so
very
afraid
that
we're
going
to
fuck
it
up
And
you
know
if
we
do
America
just
might
deserve
what
it
gets
So
seriously
I
am
signing
off
the
news
from
now
until
after
the
election
at
which
point
I
will
tune
in
and
see
whether
our
national
nightmare
is
almost
over
or
if
we're
going
to
endure
another
clusterfuck
of
epic
proportions

THE
BUSHIES
SUPPORT
SEXUAL
ASSAULT
among
other
crimes
Maybe
the
President
didn't
say
this
directly
but
he's
authorizing
it
as
part
of
his
continual
assault
on
civil
liberties
and
basic
human
decency
As
part
of
a
deal
struck
between
the
administration
and
Congress
yesterday
a
bill
may
pass
the
Senate
which
allows
wartime
commanders
to
force
prisoners
to
strip
naked
and
dance
wear
underwear
on
their
head
or
be
sexually
threatened
as
a
part
of
prisoner
interrogation
during
wartime
Basically
it's
ensuring
that
another
Abu
Ghraib
will
happen
again
soon
When
I
read
this
there
were
some
things
I
had
envisioned
for
Donald
Rumsfeld
that
I'm
sure
would
be
allowed
under
the
new
procedures
but
somehow
I
don't
think
he'd
like
them
very
much
Appalled
Of
course
you
are...go
here
to
read
more
and
tell
Congress
how
you
feel
I
hope
it
makes
a
difference
I
really
do

ABA
Bush
violating
Constitution
Bar
association
president
says
signing
statements
erode
democracy
WASHINGTON
AP
President
Bush's
penchant
for
writing
exceptions
to
laws
he
has
just
signed
violates
the
Constitution
an
American
Bar
Association
task
force
says
in
a
report
highly
critical
of
the
practice
The
ABA
group
which
includes
a
one-time
FBI
director
and
former
federal
appeals
court
judge
said
the
president
has
overstepped
his
authority
in
attaching
challenges
to
hundreds
of
new
laws
The
attachments
known
as
bill-signing
statements
say
Bush
reserves
a
right
to
revise
interpret
or
disregard
measures
on
national
security
and
constitutional
grounds
This
report
raises
serious
concerns
crucial
to
the
survival
of
our
democracy
said
the
ABA's
president
Michael
Greco
If
left
unchecked
the
president's
practice
does
grave
harm
to
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
and
the
system
of
checks
and
balances
that
have
sustained
our
democracy
for
more
than
two
centuries
Some
congressional
leaders
had
questioned
the
practice
The
task
force's
recommendations
being
released
Monday
in
Washington
will
be
presented
to
the
410,000-member
group
next
month
at
its
annual
meeting
in
Hawaii
ABA
policymakers
will
decide
whether
to
denounce
the
statements
and
encourage
a
legal
fight
over
them
The
task
force
said
the
statements
suggest
the
president
will
decline
to
enforce
some
laws
Bush
has
had
more
than
800
signing
statement
challenges
compared
with
about
600
signing
statements
combined
for
all
other
presidents
the
group
said
Noel
J
Francisco
a
former
Bush
administration
attorney
who
practices
law
in
Washington
said
the
president
is
doing
nothing
unusual
or
inappropriate
Presidents
have
always
issued
signing
statements
he
said
This
administration
believes
that
it
should
make
clear
when
the
Congress
is
getting
close
to
the
lines
that
our
Constitution
draws
Francisco
said
the
administration's
input
is
part
of
the
give
and
take
between
the
branches
of
government
I
think
it's
good
that
the
debate
is
taking
place
at
a
public
level
he
added
White
House
Press
Secretary
Tony
Snow
said
last
month
that
it's
important
for
the
president
at
least
to
express
reservations
about
the
constitutionality
of
certain
provisions
The
ABA
report
said
President
Reagan
was
the
first
to
use
the
statements
as
a
strategic
weapon
and
that
it
was
encouraged
by
then-administration
lawyer
Samuel
Alito
now
the
newest
Supreme
Court

DENNIS
MILLER
APOLOGIST
FOR
MURDER
At
the
top
is
the
annotated
text
of
an
essay
by
Dennis
Miller
comedian
and
conservative
gadfly
At
the
bottom
after
the
dashes
is
my
response
Miller's
comments
were
sent
to
me
in
an
email
as
an
example
of
the
different
schools
of
thought
about
the
Mideast
Crisis
Enjoy
A
brief
overview
of
the
situation
is
always
valuable
so
as
a
service
to
all
Americans
who
still
don't
get
it
I
now
offer
you
the
story
of
the
Middle
East
in
just
a
few
paragraphs
which
is
all
you
really
need
Here
we
go
The
Palestinians
want
their
own
country
There's
just
one
thing
about
that
There
are
no
Palestinians
It's
a
made
up
word
Israel
was
called
Palestine
for
two
thousand
years
Like
Wiccan
Palestinian
sounds
ancient
but
is
really
a
modern
invention
Before
the
Israelis
won
the
land
in
the
1967
war
Gaza
was
owned
by
Egypt
the
West
Bank
was
owned
by
Jordan
and
there
were
no
Palestinians
As
soon
as
the
Jews
took
over
and
started
growing
oranges
as
big
as
basketballs
what
do
you
know
say
hello
to
the
Palestinians
weeping
for
their
deep
bond
with
their
lost
land
and
nation
So
for
the
sake
of
honesty
let's
not
use
the
word
Palestinian
anymore
to
describe
these
delightful
folks
who
dance
for
joy
at
our
deaths
until
someone
points
out
they're
being
taped
Instead
let's
call
them
what
they
are
Other
Arabs
Who
Can't
Accomplish
Anything
In
Life
And
Would
Rather
Wrap
Themselves
In
The
Seductive
Melodrama
Of
Eternal
Struggle
And
Death
I
know
that's
a
bit
unwieldy
to
expect
to
see
on
CNN
How
about
this
then
Adjacent
Jew-Haters
Okay
so
the
Adjacent
Jew-Haters
want
their
own
country
Oops
just
one
more
thing
No
they
don't
They
could've
had
their
own
country
any
time
in
the
last
thirty
years
especially
two
years
ago
at
Camp
David
but
if
you
have
your
own
country
you
have
to
have
traffic
lights
and
garbage
trucks
and
Chambers
of
Commerce
and
worse
you
actually
have
to
figure
out
some
way
to
make
a
living
That's
no
fun
No
they
want
what
all
the
other
Jew-Haters
in
the
region
want
Israel
They
also
want
a
big
pile
of
dead
Jews
of
course
that's
where
the
real
fun
is
but
mostly
they
want
Israel
Why
For
one
thing
trying
to
destroy
Israel
or
The
Zionist
Entity
as
their
textbooks
call
it
for
the
last
fifty
years
has
allowed
the
rulers
of
Arab
countries
to
divert
the
attention
of
their
own
people
away
from
the
fact
that
they're
the
blue-ribbon
most
illiterate
poorest
and
tribally
backward
on
God's
Earth
and
if
you've
ever
been
around
God's
Earth
you
know
that's
really
saying
something
It
makes
me
roll
my
eyes
every
time
one
of
our
pundits
waxes
poetic
about
the
great
history
and
culture
of
the
Muslim
Midleast
Unless
I'm
missing
something
the
Arabs
haven't
given
anything
to
the
world
since
Algebra
and
by
the
way
thanks
a
hell
of
a
lot
for
that
one
Chew
this
around
spit
it
out
500
million
Arabs
5
million
Jews
Think
of
all
the
Arab
countries
as
a
football
field
and
Israel
as
a
pack
of
matches
sitting
in
the
middle
of
it
And
now
these
same
folks
swear
that
if
Israel
gives
them
half
of
that
pack
of
matches
everyone
will
be
pals
Really
Wow
what
neat
news
Hey
but
what
about
the
string
of
wars
to
obliterate
the
tiny
country
and
the
constant
din
of
rabid
blood
oaths
to
drive
every
Jew
into
the
sea
Oh
that
We
were
just
kidding
My
friend
Kevin
Rooney
made
a
gorgeous
point
the
other
day
Just
reverse
the
Numbers
Imagine
500
million
Jews
and
5
million
Arabs
I
was
stunned
at
the
simple
brilliance
of
it
Can
anyone
picture
the
Jews
strapping
belts
of
razor
blades
and
dynamite
to
themselves
Of
course
not
Or
marshaling
every
fiber
and
force
at
their
disposal
for
generations
to
drive
a
tiny
Arab
State
into
the
sea
Nonsense
Or
dancing
for
joy
at
the
murder
of
innocents
Impossible
Or
spreading
and
believing
horrible
lies
about
the
Arabs
baking
their
bread
with
the
blood
of
children
Disgusting
No
as
you
know
left
to
themselves
in
a
world
of
peace
the
worst
Jews
would
ever
do
to
people
is
debate
them
to
death
Mr
Bush
God
bless
him
is
walking
a
tightrope
I
understand
that
with
vital
operations
in
Iraq
and
others
it's
in
our
interest
as
Americans
to
try
to
stabilize
our
Arab
allies
as
much
as
possible
and
after
all
that
can't
be
much
harder
than
stabilizing
a
roomful
of
super
models
who've
just
had
their
drugs
taken
away
However
in
any
big-picture
strategy
there's
always
a
danger
of
losing
moral
weight
We've
already
lost
some
After
September
11th
our
president
told
us
and
the
world
he
was
going
to
root
out
all
terrorists
and
the
countries
that
supported
them
Beautiful
Then
the
Israelis
after
months
and
months
of
having
the
equivalent
of
an
Oklahoma
City
every
week
and
then
every
day
start
to
do
the
same
thing
we
did
and
we
tell
them
to
show
restraint
If
America
were
being
attacked
with
an
Oklahoma
City
every
day
we
would
all
very
shortly
be
screaming
for
the
administration
to
just
be
done
with
it
and
kill
everything
south
of
the
Mediterranean
and
east
of
the
Jordan

Re
Dennis
Miller
he
used
to
make
me
laugh
but
now
I
can't
stand
the
guy
Back
when
he
was
a
liberal
he
used
to
oversimplify
things
in
his
analysis
of
world
events
but
he
still
had
a
knack
for
telling
really
funny
stories
that
used
polysyllabic
words
to
great
effect
and
he
still
made
me
laugh
most
of
the
time
he
performed
at
Northwestern
my
freshman
year
and
I
got
to
see
him
in
person
After
9/11
he
completely
changed
his
politics
and
now
he
contradicts
everything
he
ever
said
before
Maybe
someone
close
to
him
was
killed
in
the
WTC
I
get
that
Maybe
he's
just
appalled
by
those
who
try
to
understand
why
the
terrorists
would
act
the
way
they
did
It's
not
irrelevant
trying
to
know
the
mind
and
heart
of
your
enemies
but
like
everyone
else
having
watched
those
towers
come
down
and
realizing
that
close
to
3,000
people
lost
their
lives
in
a
senseless
attack
I
can
frankly
understand
why
it
wouldn't
seem
very
important
what
was
on
the
hearts
and
minds
of
cold
blooded
murderers
All
that
being
said
one
of
the
few
things
I'm
intolerant
of
is
people
who
try
to
misinform
others
by
portraying
the
Mideast
conflict
as
a
battle
between
good
and
evil
or
right
and
wrong
There
is
no
moral
side
to
be
on
in
the
conflict
and
Miller's
anti-Arab
diatribe
conveniently
leaves
out
and
distorts
several
facts
that
would
provide
perspective
and
balance
to
the
analysis
To
wit
The
term
Israeli
is
fairly
recent
too
There
was
no
Israel
until
1947
when
the
United
Nations
feeling
tremendous
guilt
over
what
happened
to
the
Jews
in
the
Holocaust
agreed
to
carve
out
a
roughly
triangular
piece
of
land
centered
around
Jerusalem--a
holy
city
to
THREE
different
faiths
by
the
way
not
just
Jews--and
give
it
to
the
Jews
as
place
that
they
could
call
their
own
A
noble
cause
given
that
Jews
had
been
scattered
around
the
world
for
generations
and
locked
up
in
ghettos
except
that
to
create
this
Jewish
state
hundreds
of
thousands
of
Arabs
who
were
living
there
were
driven
from
their
homes
As
you
can
imagine
that
really
pissed
them
off
Miller
says
that
the
Arabs
really
wanted
the
land
when
Israel
started
growing
oranges
as
big
as
basketballs
Well
seeing
as
the
Jews
got
the
best
land
in
that
part
of
the
Middle
East
it
has
rivers
from
which
aqueducts
can
be
built
fresh
water
lakes
and
more
precipitation
than
the
Sinai
peninsula
to
the
SW
or
the
deserts
to
the
east
with
a
little
culitvation
and
a
lot
of
money
it's
not
surprising
they
were
able
to
grow
oranges--and
olives
all
kinds
of
vegetables
and
plenty
of
other
foodstuffs
Imagine
if
all
the
Black
people
in
the
United
States
were
given
their
own
state
as
compensation
for
slavery--and
we
were
given
California
You
think
other
races
in
the
other
49
states
might
be
jealous
Yeah
there's
earthquakes
and
heat
waves
but
California
is
also
the
eighth
largest
economy
in
the
world
You
get
the
picture
Anyone
who
has
been
paying
attention
knows
that
Arabs
are
not
the
most
illiterate
backwards
people
on
Earth
That's
just
racist
if
Arabs
were
a
race--they're
not
Like
most
Jews
they're
all
Caucasian
but
that's
a
different
topic
It
doesn't
end
with
algebra...The
Arabian
Nights...Schezerade
sorry
for
the
spelling
It's
kind
of
hard
to
develop
a
nation
state
when
a
no
one
will
recognize
your
country
officially
making
it
hard
to
trade
with
other
nations
and
build
your
infrastructure
and
b
some
nation
called
Israel
keeps
sending
troops
tanks
and
missles
into
your
territory
to
destroy
terrorists
Survival
becomes
a
bigger
priority
than
putting
up
a
stoplight
I
would
think
Does
Miller
think
there
aren't
militarized
Jews
who
would
gladly
kill
as
many
Palestinians
as
they
could
get
their
hands
on
Has
he
seen
MUNICH
The
fact
is
Jews
don't
have
to
kill
in
the
same
way
as
the
Arab
terrorists
do
because
they
have
a
nation-state
with
armed
forces
heavily
subsudized
by
the
United
States
that
kill
with
precision
and
thoroughness
under
the
guise
of
defense
If
you
have
no
country
and
no
formal
army
the
only
way
you
have
to
stand
up
for
yourself
is
to
throw
rocks
Or
make
yourself
a
human
bomb
Or
fire
your
AK-47
before
you
yourself
get
bombed
by
a
Stinger
missle
Does
anyone
else
find
it
interesting
that
Israel
is
launching
another
major
military
incursion
against
Lebanon
a
country
with
a
Christian
government
and
more
than
50
Christian
population
Huge
sections
of
Lebanon
are
being
destroyed
to
root
out
Hezbollah
and
Hezbollah
has
supporters
throughout
Lebanon
but
the
majority
of
Lebanese
people
are
being
hurt
even
though
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
Hezbollah
Also
is
anyone
else
offended
by
the
Jews
calling
themselves
the
Chosen
people
It's
always
bothered
me
because
I
believe
no
one
is
favored--or
cursed--by
God
But
do
you
think
Israel
governs
and
acts
differently
on
the
world
stage
and
in
the
Middle
East
because
it
believes
it's
people
are
chosen
by
God
I
do
And
that's
a
problem
Obviously
I've
barely
scratched
the
surface
here
but
Dennis
Miller
has
become
a
conservative
blowhard
and
an
apologist
for
military
overaction
throughout
the
world
It's
interesting
his
opinions
the
way
Hitler's
opinions
were
also
pretty
interesting
and
ultimately
very
dangerous
If
the
Jews
and
Arabs
could
share
the
same
land
and
have
respect
for
each
other
then
obviously
there
would
be
no
problems
but
two
thousand
plus
years
have
taught
us
that
this
is
impossible
I
don't
know
what
the
solution
is
in
the
Middle
East
but
I
know
it's
not
to
exclusively
demonize
either
the
Arabs
or
the
Jews
Each
side
must
take
responsibility
for
its
killing
and
own
up
to
their
prejudices
and
that's
the
only
way
any
progress
can
ever
be
made

WHAT
NEXT
AMERICA
What
Voting
Rights
Act
So
it
seems
that
our
esteemed
Congress
led
by
Southern
Republicans
and
those
on
the
front
line
of
the
current
immigration
debate
are
holding
up
extension
of
the
1965
Voting
Rights
Act
Read
more
about
it
in
Yahoo
news
or
Mother
Jones
Republicans
claim
that
some
provisions
of
the
Voting
Rights
Act
are
no
longer
necessary--such
as
supervision
in
nine
states
of
polling
procedures
and
the
printing
of
bilingual
ballots
in
areas
with
heavy
non-English
speaking
populations
You
might
have
missed
this
since
the
mainstream
media
certainly
didn't
cover
it
all
that
well
but
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
new
immigration
bill
passed
by
the
Senate
made
English
the
official
language
of
the
United
States
All
well
and
good
except
that
now
we
can
see
the
consequences
of
that...it
starts
with
printing
ballots
only
in
English
and
ends
who-knows-where
Although
one
would
like
to
think
that
even
if
the
Voting
Rights
Act
isn't
extended
voting
rights
will
still
be
protected
all
a
person
has
to
do
is
to
look
back
at
the
2000
elections
to
realize
that
we
need
all
the
protection
we
can
get
If
your
skin
is
brown
or
reddish
or
you
have
ovaries
it
pays
to
remain
ever
vigilant
Every
day
right-wing
Republicans
are
starting
to
look
more
and
more
like
the
intolerant
bigoted
extreme
religious
fascists
they
claim
to
hate
I
don't
even
have
to
squint
anymore
to
see
the
similarities
My
advice--write
to
your
Congressperson
to
pressure
them
into
extending
the
Act
We
have
nothing
to
lose
and
everything
to
gain

THE
BLOGGERS
LAMENT...or
Conspiracy
Yesterday
I
typed
an
open
letter
to
the
Bush
Administration
and
the
top
members
of
the
G.O.P
in
which
I
chastised
them
for
introducing
legislation
to
ban
gay
marriage
at
a
time
when
so
many
other
more
important
issues
must
be
dealt
with
in
this
country
a
litany
ranging
from
the
bloodshed
in
Iraq
to
rebuilding
New
Orleans
and
getting
control
of
the
oil
and
gas
cartels
who
are
ripping
us
off
Yet
due
to
problems
with
my
server
either
at
home
or
on
the
blogspot
site
this
magnificent
editorial
was
not
only
not
posted
it
wasn't
even
saved
Or
was
it
the
work
of
the
PResident
and
his
minions
censoring
free
speech
I
guess
we'll
never
know
All
I
can
do
now
is
give
you
the
Cliff's
Notes
version
of
this
blog
anti
gay
marriage
amendment
bad
Doing
all
the
other
work
necessary
to
keep
this
country
from
falling
into
the
Third
World

Dear
Governor
Rounds
Since
abortion
is
murder
why
not
make
it
a
capital
offense
to
kill
an
unborn
child
Yes
make
the
penalty
for
any
woman
who
has
an
abortion
or
any
doctor
who
performs
an
abortion
execution
I
guarantee
that
if
we
lethally
injected
a
few
of
these
folks
the
abortion
rate
in
this
country
would
plummet
And
while
we
are
at
it
let's
make
it
a
capital
offense
to
masturbate
since
millions
of
sperm
die
every
time
a
man
ejaculates
In
fact
let's
set
up
screening
clinics
to
make
sure
that
if
a
woman
has
a
period
that
she
didn't
unwittingly
spontaneously
abort
a
baby
Of
course
the
penalty
for
this
offense
which
I
call
menstrual
manslaughter
would
only
be
ten
years
in
prison
rather
than
death
Sincerely
yours
Out
of
my
mind

NC
