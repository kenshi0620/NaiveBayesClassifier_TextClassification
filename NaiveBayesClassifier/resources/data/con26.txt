Bush
pointing
the
way
forward
for
Europe
The
Economist
President
Bush
managed
to
push
his
controversial
Central
American
Free
Trade
Agreement
through
the
lower
house
of
America's
Congress
in
the
early
hours
of
Thursday
This
small
victory
for
free
trade
means
the
outlook
for
the
much
bigger
and
more
important
Doha
round
of
world
trade
talks
is
less
gloomy
than
it
was
but
only
slightly
It
was
a
close
call
for
Bush
facing
opposition
both
from
Republican
and
Democrat
benches
Now
Americans
have
NAFTA
and
CAFTA
but
what
has
Europe
got
to
do
with
it
What
is
to
stop
Europe
from
putting
a
Mediterranean
Free
Trade
Agreement
MEFTA
in
place
Manifold
potential
benefits
arising
as
a
consequence
of
trading
include
rising
standards
of
living
in
generally
shabby
North
African
countries
thus
not
only
helping
the
poor
but
also
alleviating
the
pressure
of
illegal
immigration
on
Europe
We
should
also
be
looking
beyond
the
material
benefits
Let
us
not
forget
commerce
is
an
inherent
part
of
the
spirit
of
Berbers
Jews
and
Arabs
so
MEFTA
could
become
a
powerful
engine
behind
efforts
to
bring
peace
into
this
crisis
prone
region

Rational
demands
of
Islamic
terrorists
I
haven't
commented
on
the
Newstalk
106
Breakfast
show
for
some
time
now
That
is
mostly
because
I
haven't
had
a
stomach
to
listen
to
that
clown
Richard
Curran
Bring
Eamon
Dunphy
back
This
morning
I
did
Tony
Blair
said
at
the
news
conference
that
the
demands
of
Islamic
extremists
are
not
rational
and
therefore
cannot
be
heeded
in
a
bid
to
save
us
from
further
carnage
Richey
and
his
cherry
picked
guests
on
this
morning
show
begged
to
differ
Of
course
the
demands
of
al
Qaeda
are
rational
all
they
want
is
to
get
the
Western
troops
out
of
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
Really
But
the
last
time
I
checked
there
were
a
few
more
issues
on
their
agenda
Islamic
extremists
want
to
overthrow
the
regimes
in
Egypt
Kuwait
and
Saudi
Arabia
At
least
that
is
what
their
principal
ideologist
spiritual
leader
and
the
prime
source
of
finances
say
While
this
proposal
probably
seems
reasonable
at
the
first
glance
because
the
governments
in
Saudi
and
Egypt
are
run
by
unelected
tyrants
the
lefty
buffoons
forget
that
dear
old
Osama
is
not
exactly
a
fan
of
democracy
He
cares
to
replace
these
regimes
with
an
Islamic
state
from
Morocco
to
Indonesia
based
on
a
purist
form
of
Islam
as
seen
under
Taliban
in
Afghanistan
I
am
sure
al-Andalus
which
is
almost
half
of
Spain
is
there
lingering
in
the
back
of
their
minds
And
watching
The
New
Al-Qaeda
on
BBC
ONE
the
last
Monday
I
heard
some
angry
Muslim
men
claiming
Britain
too
Even
though
his
immediate
goal
is
indeed
to
drive
infidels
out
the
Islamic
states
on
the
long
run
Bin
Laden
wants
to
put
in
place
a
tyranny
much
more
ruthless
and
unyielding
than
any
other
ever
seen
on
the
planet
with
the
possible
exception
of
those
of
Kim
Yong
Il
and
Hitler
There
is
no
doubt
about
it
Just
check
his
agenda
he
blames
the
Saudi
ruling
family
who
run
the
least
secular
country
on
the
planet
for
not
being
Islamic
enough
It
is
hard
to
conceive
any
other
option
for
those
in
this
state
who
do
not
fit
into
this
apocalyptic
vision
of
purist
Islam
except
to
comply
die
or
become
dhimmy
slaves
And
what
fate
there
is
for
the
state
of
Israel
in
the
minds
of
those
fanatics
one
can
only
imagine
So
does
all
this
appear
like
a
rational
proposal
to
you
I
am
positive
the
lefty
buffoons
are
aware
of
all
this
in
the
back
of
their
minds
It
is
only
that
their
self-loathing
and
anti-Americanism
overwhelms
their
reasoning
Or
maybe
it
doesn't
Maybe
they
would
be
more
than
happy
in
a
world
run
by
the
Islamic
fanatics
There
would
be
no
commercials
no
profit
no
corporations
no
gas-guzzling
cars
no
supermarkets
no
businessmen
and
no
need
to
assume
personal
responsibility
or
initiative
because
the
state
would
have
all
the
answers
Sounds
like
a
lefty
paradise
to
me

There
is
a
good
comment
by
Richard
Waghorne
of
the
Freedom
Institute
on
an
article
by
Adrian
Wooldridge
and
John
Micklethwait
authors
of
the
Right
Nation
On
the
surface
British
politicians
are
doing
pretty
much
what
American
leaders
did
after
9/11
rallying
the
people
without
stoking
fear
and
extending
the
government's
power
to
deal
with
terrorists
without
sacrificing
the
essence
of
a
free
society
Yet
there
are
also
striking
differences
that
could
have
big
implications
for
Britain's
continued
participation
in
the
war
on
terrorism

The
question
of
grocery
retail
profits
The
Fine
Gael
spokesman
for
agriculture
Denis
Naughten
launched
an
attack
on
supermarket
chains
for
running
high
margins
on
agriculture
products
diary
and
meat
products
in
particular
and
thus
giving
their
customers
and
the
farmers
an
unfair
deal
Mr
Naughten's
entrepreneurial
spirit
deserves
praise
for
identifying
a
genuine
business
opportunity
In
the
following
weeks
Mr
Naughten
could
reveal
his
plans
to
set
up
a
grocery
retail
business
and
explore
this
market
opportunity
to
the
benefit
of
both
farmers
and
consumers
The
consumer
is
footing
the
bill
for
the
margins
the
retailer
is
making
and
the
consumer
needs
to
become
more
conscious
of
this
so
that
we
can
try
and
address
it
and
ensure
everyone
gets
a
fair
deal
he
said
Fine
Gael's
ongoing
efforts
to
raise
consumer
awareness
are
commendable
but
regretfully
there
are
indications
this
campaign
may
be
just
another
election
gimmick
Statements
like
the
highest
mark-up
was
on
milk
which
had
an
average
retail
price
of
85c
a
litre
from
which
the
producer
only
got
27c
seemingly
suggesting
that
the
retailer
is
making
70
on
milk
will
certainly
win
votes
but
as
an
argument
it
has
little
or
no
value
In
fact
its
potential
to
mislead
the
punters
is
damaging
Efforts
should
be
made
to
go
beyond
this
populist
modus
operandi
There
is
a
lot
to
be
said
about
the
consumer
prices
in
Ireland
According
to
The
National
Competitiveness
Council
Ireland
and
Finland
are
now
the
most
expensive
European
countries
A
basket
of
five
goods
in
Tesco
in
Ireland
was
43
dearer
on
average
than
in
the
UK
said
Fine
Gail
on
their
website
dedicated
to
rip-off
Ireland
http://www.ripoff.ie
Faced
with
such
accusations
retailers
point
out
to
comparatively
higher
costs
of
running
a
business
in
Ireland
They
may
be
onto
something
here
because
they
too
are
facing
the
same
ridiculous
insurance
bills
as
the
rest
of
us
are
They
are
also
facing
the
spiralling
labour
costs
The
National
Competitiveness
Council
estimates
the
average
annual
compensation
stands
at
38,140
in
Ireland
topping
the
EU-15
average
of
34,630
and
the
UK
average
of
35,750
The
fact
the
population
has
more
disposable
income
to
spend
is
certainly
driving
the
prices
of
goods
and
services
up
more
than
anything
else
None
of
this
does
prove
or
disprove
the
retailers
are
indeed
pocketing
extraordinary
profits
The
large
groceries
provide
little
information
about
their
business
in
Ireland
It
is
hard
to
tell
whether
the
underlying
reason
for
secrecy
can
be
found
in
the
absence
of
legal
requirement
to
disclose
financial
information
or
is
it
that
they
have
something
to
hide
Superquinn
and
Dunnes
Stores
are
privately
owned
and
are
not
obliged
to
disclose
financial
results
Their
principal
competitor
Tesco
reported
an
operating
margin
of
5.9
in
the
UK
for
the
year
2004
but
the
profit
they
made
in
Ireland
was
lumped
with
the
Rest
of
Europe
where
4.7
was
reported
The
Irish
sales
constituted
a
significant
38
of
their
total
European
sales
of
3,834m
If
their
operating
margin
in
Ireland
was
10
that
would
effectively
mean
that
the
businesses
they
did
in
the
rest
of
Europe
excluding
Ireland
would
have
operated
at
a
meagre
1.25
That
is
hard
to
believe
It
is
more
likely
that
the
figure
is
a
good
deal
below
10
and
closer
to
the
UK
result
The
Sunday
Tribune
was
of
similar
opinion
in
April
this
year
They
estimated
Tesco
made
137m
profit
from
its
grocery
retail
in
Ireland
in
2004
putting
the
margin
at
7
better
than
Tesco
performed
in
any
other
market
But
this
is
merely
1.1
and
2.3
above
the
UK
and
the
rest
of
Europe
figures
hardly
a
spectacular
result
It
certainly
does
not
account
for
a
43
price
difference
between
baskets
of
five
goods
in
Tesco
in
Ireland
and
the
UK
In
2002
the
largest
American
retailers
Wal-Mart
and
Target
had
achieved
profit
margins
of
7.6
and
8.4
respectively
We
appreciate
the
differences
in
size
but
this
is
still
a
good
indication
of
margins
which
can
be
achieved
on
the
global
level
While
Wal-Mart
with
430b
sales
is
beyond
any
comparison
the
volume
of
sales
of
Target
is
only
6
times
of
what
Tesco
sold
globally
Target
is
the
second
grocery
retailer
in
the
USA
while
Tesco
is
number
two
in
Europe
There
is
further
evidence
the
margins
in
the
Irish
grocery
retail
are
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
For
example
Musgrave
the
parent
company
of
Centra
SuperValu
and
Londis
reported
a
small
operating
margin
of
2.7
with
roughly
60
of
its
turnover
coming
from
Ireland
It
is
possible
although
unlikely
that
Musgrave's
businesses
outside
Ireland
are
being
heavily
subsidised
by
the
Irish
consumers
Furthermore
the
June
2005
report
by
the
Central
Statistics
Office
reported
a
1.2
fall
of
CPI
for
food
and
non-alcoholic
beverages
probably
a
result
of
the
cutthroat
competition
in
the
sector
But
even
if
the
case
against
the
greedy
retailers
was
more
compelling
discussion
about
the
profit
margins
while
ignoring
other
factors
contributing
to
high
prices
is
beside
the
point
And
what
is
the
benefit
of
this
information
going
public
anyway
It
is
doubtful
the
potential
customers
would
engage
in
checking
the
profit
margin
of
each
retailer
before
hitting
the
supermarkets
They
would
remain
to
be
driven
by
factors
like
the
price
the
quality
and
the
convenience
And
if
the
government
needs
to
know
retailers
profit
margins
to
shape
their
policies
they
don't
need
to
twist
the
retailers
arms
to
get
it
They
already
have
this
information
submitted
to
them
for
tax
purposes
Back
in
February
last
year
the
Oireachtas
called
the
retailers
to
disclose
their
profits
It
must
be
that
the
politicians
realised
the
futility
of
this
effort
because
not
much
has
happened
since
to
resolve
this
mystery
It
could
also
be
that
the
politicians
found
the
margins
to
be
relatively
reasonable
in
which
case
there
is
more
benefit
in
keeping
them
undisclosed
Focusing
on
how
much
other
people
made
while
doing
business
has
been
a
vote-winning
business
bashing
strategy
popular
since
the
times
Jesus
Christ
walked
the
Earth
This
particular
red
herring
eclipses
more
important
issues
which
could
be
addressed
to
ensure
everyone
gets
a
fair
deal
While
minor
in
the
context
of
Irish
grocery
retail
prices
the
issue
of
transparency
of
data
available
to
investors
is
an
important
one
The
local
and
international
professional
accounting
bodies
should
be
asked
to
investigate
the
companies
in
question
and
amend
the
standards
if
necessary
to
stop
them
from
misleading
the
investors
For
example
Tesco
could
be
reported
to
the
ASB's
Financial
Reporting
Review
Panel
for
failing
to
disclose
proper
segmental
results
Investors
are
certainly
interested
to
learn
whether
Tesco
underperforms
on
the
European
markets
so
there
is
a
good
chance
the
FRRP
would
investigate
the
case
It
is
important
for
businesses
to
become
less
complacent
and
more
active
in
the
public
debate
Continuous
efforts
of
politicians
and
pressure
groups
to
wind
the
population
up
will
eventually
result
in
an
increased
regulation
Although
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
they
are
reluctant
to
provide
sensitive
commercial
information
such
as
operating
margins
to
their
competition
not
only
to
the
public
unless
forced
by
law
or
accounting
standards
they
have
to
make
an
intellectual
case
to
defend
from
these
ridiculous
attacks
and
regain
the
lost
moral
ground
Finally
the
most
important
is
the
issue
of
ensuring
an
unimpeded
competition
takes
place
The
anti-competition
laws
preventing
the
players
from
fixing
prices
and
forming
cartels
should
be
rigorously
enforced
Fortunately
competition
is
alive
and
kicking
in
Ireland
so
this
issue
rarely
gets
attention
which
is
not
to
suggest
it
should
be
completely
forgotten
Competition
remains
the
most
powerful
tool
to
compensate
for
market
distortions
The
suggestion
that
Mr
Naughten
could
venture
into
the
grocery
retail
business
was
not
a
cynical
joke

Further
to
my
previous
post
Let
us
procreate
It
was
suggested
by
some
of
our
valuable
readers
that
USA
enjoys
higher
population
growth
rates
because
it
has
a
lot
more
immigration
and
poverty
than
Europe
I
certainly
agree
that
immigrants
do
contribute
to
the
population
growth
Between
1990
and
1998
5.4
million
babies
were
born
to
immigrant
women
what
makes
roughly
30
percent
of
the
total
population
growth
in
the
US
But
even
when
these
births
are
excluded
the
US
still
have
a
considerably
higher
population
growth
than
the
EU
To
be
fair
we
should
also
exclude
the
immigrant
births
from
the
EU
statistics
but
that
would
get
us
nowhere
It
was
not
our
intention
to
discuss
racial
or
immigration
implications
of
the
population
growth
There
is
nothing
to
stop
Europe
to
get
more
immigrants
and
fix
the
demographics
except
perhaps
the
fact
that
there
are
no
jobs
around
and
except
perhaps
the
fact
that
the
Continent
is
labouring
under
misapprehension
that
isolation
will
preserve
their
jobs
and
intensifying
laziness
Let
us
have
a
look
at
the
other
explanation
the
poverty
While
I
do
agree
there
is
a
casual
relation
between
the
income
levels
and
birth
rates
I
do
not
agree
there
is
a
causative
relation
between
the
two
This
is
because
the
data
which
could
support
a
causative
relation
between
the
two
is
not
consistent
For
example
Latino
families
have
higher
incomes
than
African
American
families
34k
versus
29k
US
Census
2000
and
yet
Latinos
have
higher
total
fertility
rate
than
African
Americans
2.75
versus
2.10
National
Vital
Statistics
Report
2003
American
Indians
have
an
average
income
of
30k
but
have
a
far
lower
fertility
rate
than
the
other
two
1.75
At
best
I
can
agree
that
people
on
lower
incomes
generally
tend
to
have
more
babies
So
what
People
on
higher
incomes
express
far
more
interest
in
art
than
people
on
lower
incomes
Is
that
to
suggest
there
is
a
causative
relation
between
the
two
Nonsense
Many
galleries
are
free
or
relatively
cheep
the
cost
of
one
beer
to
visit
but
people
on
lower
incomes
or
welfare
are
apparently
not
interested
or
have
something
better
to
do
People
with
higher
education
do
have
quite
rightfully
higher
incomes
and
one
might
easily
argue
that
people
from
deprived
backgrounds
cannot
attain
higher
education
and
are
therefore
caught
in
the
poverty
trap
But
how
come
poor
Asian
students
are
not
caught
in
the
poverty
trap
How
come
77
of
Asians
graduate
above
the
US
average
and
only
50
odd
percent
of
African
Americans
and
Latinos
do
I
am
sure
Asians
were
not
rich
when
they
migrated
to
USA
so
how
come
they
make
it
and
others
don't
It
helps
that
Asians
top
the
IQ
charts
even
the
poor
ones
would
you
believe
it
It
also
helps
the
Asians
have
the
lowest
incidence
of
teenage
pregnancies
But
the
ultimate
answer
my
dear
readers
lies
in
the
fact
that
education
hard
work
and
discipline
are
rooted
deeply
into
the
Confucian
tradition
The
cultural
aspects
across
the
population
spectrum
are
the
single
biggest
factor
which
determines
whether
someone
will
attain
higher
education
and
higher
income
or
end
up
pregnant
at
the
age
of
16
receiving
welfare
till
the
end
of
the
life
It
is
the
cultural
aspects
as
well
as
the
general
outlook
that
affect
the
population
growth
The
culture
of
Europeans
and
everyone
else
is
more-less
an
evolving
concept
Regretfully
the
current
trends
feature
an
upswing
in
pessimism
laziness
and
a
general
drop
in
procreation
And
if
Europe
wants
to
be
strong
and
continue
to
shape
the
history
as
it
has
been
doing
for
the
last
six
centuries
this
problem
should
be
discussed
and
acted
upon
But
why
was
the
alleged
abundance
of
poverty
in
USA
offered
as
an
explanation
for
the
comparatively
favourable
demographics
of
the
States
Well
even
though
none
of
our
readers
has
yet
explicitly
pulled
out
the
argument
we
know
where
it
is
going
to
terrible
income
inequality
in
the
USA
Yes
the
States
feature
vast
cultural
differences
and
differences
in
abilities
and
wiliness
to
work
across
the
population
spectrum
the
Bell
curve
appears
in
almost
all
statistics
and
that
is
naturally
reflected
in
the
income
distribution
Of
course
the
good
auld
Europe
is
not
untouched
by
the
same
differences
but
lads
over
here
have
decided
they
wanted
to
flatten
the
Bell
curve
up
a
bit
While
very
little
can
be
done
to
flatten
the
IQ
distribution
a
lot
could
be
done
to
flatten
the
cultural
differences
in
terms
of
fixing
those
lacking
in
certain
aspects
but
that
is
not
endorsed
because
all
cultures
are
equal
and
you
should
just
be
yourself
So
the
easiest
thing
to
do
to
bring
to
life
this
utopian
endeavour
is
to
engineer
the
murky
income
distribution
statistics
in
the
name
of
social
justice
And
that
is
why
our
readers
pulled
the
poverty
ace
from
the
sleeve
hopeful
to
deliver
coup
de
grâce
in
the
name
of
the
morally
superior
egalitarian
Continent
This
self-proclaimed
moral
superiority
is
highly
questionable
though
Equality
of
outcome
cannot
and
should
not
be
guaranteed
because
it
encourages
people
to
do
as
little
as
possible
to
get
by
There
is
no
point
in
excelling
because
what
difference
does
it
make
Those
who
fiddled
with
such
systems
former
Soviet
Union
Yugoslavia
etc
had
generally
failed
and
along
the
way
they
had
lost
some
of
the
brightest
of
their
kin
This
is
what
the
French
are
experiencing
right
now
with
a
rising
number
of
entrepreneurs
fleeing
to
Switzerland
to
escape
from
the
rampaging
socialists
As
Von
Mises
once
said
Inequality
of
wealth
and
income
is
an
essential
feature
of
the
market
economy
It
is
the
implement
that
makes
the
consumers
supreme
in
giving
them
the
power
to
force
all
those
engaged
in
production
to
comply
with
their
orders
It
forces
all
those
engaged
in
production
to
the
utmost
exertion
in
the
service
of
the
consumers
It
makes
competition
work
He
who
best
serves
the
consumers
profits
most
and
accumulates
riches
while
others
do
the
necessary
corrections
and
try
to
catch
up
This
game
is
the
essence
of
progress

Let
us
procreate
A
disturbing
thought
came
into
my
mind
last
night
when
I
was
watching
Hatch
with
my
better
half
American
movies
almost
always
feature
a
happy
end
while
European
movies
with
the
exception
of
the
odd
comedy
seldom
do
American
movies
make
you
want
to
go
out
and
live
your
life
to
the
full
win
laugh
or
kick
ass
In
contrast
the
European
movies
feature
people
immersed
into
their
routines
pondering
about
their
meaningless
lives
The
European
movies
make
you
want
to
do
nothing
Now
I
know
this
observation
is
highly
subjective
and
I
also
know
there
are
many
entertaining
European
movies
bursting
with
life
However
considering
how
gloomy
an
average
European
movie
is
in
comparison
with
the
works
coming
from
across
the
Atlantic
I
think
I'm
quite
right
to
question
the
European
biological
will
to
live
It
may
be
tempting
to
dismiss
such
a
fundamental
objection
based
on
a
subjective
observation
of
something
relatively
unrelated
It
is
also
easy
to
dismiss
American
movies
as
shallow
factually
incorrect
and
intellectually
unchallenging
but
that
would
be
entirely
beside
the
point
To
further
elaborate
on
the
issue
let
us
have
a
look
at
the
statistics
Here
you
can
find
a
comparison
of
population
growth
of
developed
countries
data
for
USA
0.92
and
Spain
0.15
should
be
added
It
is
embarrassing
for
the
Europeans
Things
aren't
much
better
when
one
considers
the
total
fertility
rates
either
North
America
averaged
2.0
babies
born
to
women
during
their
reproductive
years
USA
had
a
total
of
2.1
1.9
when
baby-booming
Latinos
and
African
Americans
are
excluded
while
the
EU-15
managed
1.5
It
is
considered
that
a
total
fertility
rate
of
2.1
is
required
merely
to
replace
the
population
So
it
is
clear
that
Europe
is
slowly
heading
towards
a
demise
should
the
trend
continue
But
that
is
nothing
new
to
you
There
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
about
the
troublesome
demographic
of
the
ageing
continent
but
none
of
them
really
touched
the
collective
spirit
of
the
continental
Europe
The
fashionable
wisdom
says
that
the
consumerism
and
material
wealth
are
to
blame
for
our
lack
of
procreation
That
could
be
so
up
to
an
extent
But
how
is
that
the
mother
of
consumerism
the
wealthy
USA
still
manage
to
procreate
faster
than
self-righteously
anti-materialistic
Europeans
How
is
that
the
wealthy
Ireland
and
Luxembourg
top
the
European
population
growth
chart
The
zealots
on
the
left
are
always
quick
to
blame
the
money
for
every
conceivable
problem
They
have
created
this
fashionable
wisdom
and
once
more
diverted
the
discussion
from
the
real
issue
the
rising
pessimism
in
Europe
How
to
reverse
the
trend
is
open
for
discussion
Once
the
Europeans
start
filming
happy
ends
I
bet
the
population
statistics
will
improve
Until
then
the
continent
will
continue
to
fade
away
immersed
in
its
dreams
of
the
past
glory
and

delusions
about

The
true
culprit
of
terrorism
It
has
become
normal
for
the
political
commentators
to
spread
misconceptions
about
the
driving
force
of
the
modern-day
terrorism
Take
this
statement
for
example
Tariq
Ali
in
the
Guardian
The
real
solution
lies
in
immediately
ending
the
occupation
of
Iraq
Afghanistan
and
Palestine
Were
the
terrorist
worried
about
Palestine
Did
Tariq
forget
the
9/11
atrocities
were
planned
amidst
of
Bill
Clinton's
efforts
to
bring
peace
to
Palestine
Tariq
suggests
the
terrorists
were
pissed
off
because
of
the
occupation
of
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
Did
he
forget
the
9/11
happened
a
couple
of
years
before
the
regimes
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
were
overthrown
and
the
two
countries
occupied
Did
the
Saudi
9/11
bombers
fight
for
a
free
Saudi
Arabia
or
a
free
Afghanistan
Free
from
what
Take
the
following
statement
then
Polly
Toynbee
in
the
Guardian
Until
wealth
and
democracy
is
more
evenly
spread
this
may
stay
part
of
modern
climate
change
a
price
to
be
paid
She
is
right
about
democracy
because
the
lack
of
it
could
easily
lead
to
violent
expression
of
oppressed
political
ideas
But
I
can't
hear
Polly
praising
the
allies
for
facilitating
free
elections
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
It
seems
to
me
Polly
and
the
likes
of
her
somehow
preferred
the
status
quo
And
this
claim
about
poverty
doesn't
survive
the
reality
check
Polly
should
be
told
that
the
poorest
countries
on
the
planet
are
virtually
terrorist-free
Who
has
ever
heard
of
an
Ethiopian
or
a
Bangladeshi
terrorist
blowing
himself
up
in
the
name
of
social
justice
and
redistribution
of
wealth
Poverty
has
nothing
to
do
terrorism
The
opinions
like
the
ones
Tariq
and
Polly
care
to
share
with
us
somehow
go
down
well
with
the
public
mainly
because
these
are
in
line
with
both
archaic
and
contemporary
religious
beliefs
and
because
to
claim
something
else
is
politically
incorrect
It
is
the
just
struggle
of
the
poor
and
the
oppressed
against
the
evil
brought
down
upon
us
by
the
rich
and
powerful
they
say
But
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
Behind
the
terrorist
acts
of
al
Qaeda
lies
nothing
else
but
profound
ideological
incompatibility
of
the
attackers
with
the
libertarian
set
of
values
It
is
the
same
ideological
incompatibility
which
used
to
drive
the
European
extreme
left
of
the
past
like
Baader
Meinhof
or
Brigate
Rosse
It
is
the
ideological
contempt
of
those
who
wish
to
surrender
their
freedom
to
someone
or
something
else
just
to
avoid
the
agony
of
the
free
will
and
the
responsibility
of
the
personal
choice
They
want
someone
else
to
take
care
of
their
affairs
and
tell
them
what
to
do
They
want
God
they
want
the
Society
or
they
want
the
Party
to
be
responsible
for
their
lives
Hence
the
praise
and
the
understanding
the
Islamic
extremists
receive
from
the
European
left
They
fight
for
the
same
cause
and
against
the
same
enemy

The
Circus
in
Kaliningrad
French
arrogance
sans
frontieres
strikes
again
According
to
Liberation
French
President
Jacques
Chirac
was
cracking
jokes
about
the
British
food
and
agriculture
during
the
summit
in
Kaliningrad
This
summit
was
bizarre
enough
without
the
French
sense
of
humour
The
venue
was
a
former
Prussian
town
Königsberg
which
was
taken
from
the
Germans
after
the
Second
World
War
The
summit
was
mostly
about
a
Putin's
attempt
to
ensure
existence
of
the
Kaliningrad
enclave
unhindered
by
the
strict
EU
border
rules
applied
by
the
freshmen
the
neighbouring
Poles
and
Lithuanians
But
the
two
were
not
invited
so
one
can
only
assume
the
Russian
tzar
is
hopeful
the
French
and
German
EU-emperors
will
sort
them
out
Schroeder
and
Chirac
happily
accepted
the
role
what
speaks
volumes
about
how
they
perceive
the
EU
Let
us
see
what
else
was
funny
The
only
thing
they
the
English
have
ever
done
for
European
agriculture
is
mad
cow
said
Chirac
to
Putin's
and
Schroeder's
amusement
We
are
all
so
proud
of
the
French
agriculture
After
all
we
are
all
paying
for
it
Some
40
of
the
EU
budget
goes
to
the
French
peasants
to
keep
up
the
good
work
Well
done
lads
Pity
your
resources
could
be
put
into
more
cost-effective
use
elsewhere
And
our
food
could
be
cheaper
too
It
got
even
better
You
can't
trust
people
the
English
who
cook
as
badly
as
that
It
has
not
been
said
if
Gerhard
Schroeder
got
the
joke
The
German
cabbage-sausage
cuisine
isn't
exactly
renowned
for
its
opulence
and
the
Germans
did
invade
France
twice
When
they
did
it
for
the
second
time
the
other
lot
with
uninspiring
cuisine
the
Russians
already
had
a
pact
with
the
aggressor
so
I
am
not
quite
sure
who
did
Chirac
really
refer
to
I
just
hope
the
untrustworthy
English
and
the
damn
Yanks
will
not
interfere
if
these
demonstrations
of
affection
take
place
again
so
that
the
French
and
the
Germans
can
indulge
freely
in
their
friendship

Sustainable
Development
This
morning
Eamon
Dunphy
summoned
two
fine
gentlemen
There
was
a
university
professor
whose
name
I
didn't
remember
whining
about
the
unsustainable
development
of
the
Dublin
commuter
belt
and
then
there
was
The
Irish
Times
environmental
editor
Frank
McDonald
observed
how
Cork
should
be
bigger
In
fact
twice
the
size
But
damn
those
people
they
all
want
to
live
in
Dublin
Well
perhaps
the
Government
should
start
shipping
us
around
the
country
and
tell
us
where
to
live
and
where
to
work
But
would
that
be
the
same
government
which
at
least
according
to
these
lads
have
created
this
fine
mess
we
are
supposedly
in
Funny
the
proponents
of
social
engineering
regularly
fail
to
spot
this
little
inconsistency
of
their
own
Perhaps
someone
should
sit
them
both
down
and
explain
the
history
of
big
cities
Some
places
that
used
to
be
grim
god-forsaken
dormitories
in
the
past
have
developed
into
self-contained
towns
with
shopping
malls
and
business
parks
Blanchardstown
is
one
of
them
I
am
sure
the
same
fate
is
on
the
cards
for
the
likes
of
Ratoath
As
soon
as
there
is
a
critical
mass
of
people
in
an
area
companies
and
reatilers
go
there
creating
jobs
and
providing
services
And
what
is
sustainable
development
after
all
This
is
one
of
the
terms
the
uttering
of
which
makes
oneself
feel
so
good
but
are
at
the
same
time
meaningless
from
the
practical
point
of
view
It
is
something
like
corporate
social
responsibility
How
does
one
decide
that
a
society
is
at
the
point
where
it
has
reached
sustainable
development
How
does
one
decide
a
company
has
become
socially
responsible
Perhaps
that
is
the
point
leave
more
room
for
whining

Africa
aid
corruption
and
growth
Helping
Africa
is
a
hot
topic
these
days
Pop
stars
politicians
and
other
prominent
figures
in
Europe
and
across
the
pond
compete
in
calls
for
debt
relief
and
more
aid
to
help
African
economies
grow
The
same
people
are
usually
dismissive
about
those
who
would
prefer
to
see
certain
conditions
aimed
towards
achieving
better
governance
and
reducing
corruption
attached
to
the
entire
package
Even
Jeffrey
Sachs
jumped
on
the
bandwagon
and
said
in
an
NYT
interview
that
the
idea
that
African
failure
is
due
to
African
poor
governance
is
one
of
the
great
myths
of
our
time
It
must
be
true
if
Jeffrey
Sachs
says
so
Empirical
evidence
as
Marian
L
Tupy
of
the
Cato
Institute
points
out
seems
to
suggest
otherwise
between
1960
and
2005
foreign
aid
worth
more
than
450
billion
inflation
adjusted
poured
into
Africa
Result
Between
1975
and
2000
African
gross
domestic
product
GDP
per
capita
declined
at
an
average
annual
0.59
percent
rate
Over
the
same
period
African
GDP
per
capita
fell
from
1,770
in
constant
1995
dollars
adjusted
for
purchasing
power
parity
PPP
to
1,479
In
contrast
South
Asia
performed
much
better
Between
1975
and
2000
South
Asian
GDP
per
capita
grew
at
an
average
annual
2.94
percent
South
Asian
GDP
per
capita
grew
from
1,010
in
constant
1995
dollars
adjusted
for
PPP
to
2,056
Yet
between
1975
and
2000
the
per
capita
foreign
aid
South
Asians
received
was
21
percent
that
received
by
Africa
The
link
between
foreign
aid
and
economic
development
seems
quite
tenuous
Professor
Sachs
also
suggested
that
Africa
is
improving
in
combating
the
endemic
corruption
Again
the
figures
suggest
the
opposite
is
true
But
evidence
is
not
on
Professor
Sachs
side
African
corruption
has
been
getting
worse
not
better
over
the
last
few
years
Each
year
Transparency
International
publishes
its
Corruption
Perception
Index
CPI
The
CPI
defines
corruption
as
abuse
of
public
office
for
private
gain
It
is
measured
on
a
scale
from
0
to
10
The
higher
the
number
the
lower
the
corruption
In
2000
the
average
African
CPI
was
3.24
By
2004
the
African
CPI
fell
to
2.87
Another
issue
the
one
of
agricultural
subsidies
in
US
and
EU
is
often
mentioned
in
the
context
of
African
poverty
While
it
is
true
that
the
archaic
agricultural
subsidies
in
the
West
should
be
abolished
simply
because
they
distort
markets
and
stand
in
the
way
of
allocating
resources
to
their
more
efficient
use
the
extent
they
have
on
keeping
Africa
poor
is
arguable
It
is
true
that
subsidised
food
from
the
West
prevent
African
farmers
from
exporting
more
food
and
making
more
money
However
it
is
often
forgotten
that
the
subsidised
western
food
is
actually
benefiting
the
African
urban
population
39
of
Africans
in
the
same
time
Considering
that
the
agriculture
sector
employs

Sir

Sir

Geldof
is
apparently
being

for
20
years
of
unpaid

I

on

laughing
when
I

We

the

for

But
it's
not

that's
funny
It's
that
the

couldn't

been

The

or

is

him
should
come
out
and
say
it
will
cost

all

Euro
Like
The
Ball
and
Chain
The
euro
is
a
marriage
in
the
old
style
one
of
those
entered
into
when
divorce
did
not
exist
said
Joaquin
Almunia
the
European
Commissioner
responsible
for
monetary
issues
in
a
response
to
comments
made
by
Italian
Social
Affairs
Minister
Roberto
Maroni
Maroni's
no-more-Euro
song
was
out
of
tune
with
his
coalition
boss
Berlusconi
who
told
him
to
shut
up
This
was
probably
because
the
boss
wants
to
keep
this
Ace
up
the
sleeve
in
a
bid
to
save
his
coalition
from
a
fiasco
at
the
next
election
But
by
the
time
Berlusconi
pulls
the
Euro
card
this
particular
set
of
smokes
and
mirrors
will
be
déj
vu
German
SPD
is
already
gearing
up
for
the
general
elections
under
the
same
slogan
They
tricked
the
voters
the
last
time
with
the
Iraq
card
and
they
are
hopeful
to
trick
them
again
We
did
point
out
earlier
that
the
Euro
doesn't
work
well
for
the
sluggish
continental
economies
However
the
problems
in
Germany
and
Italy
run
much
deeper
so
it's
hard
to
believe
that
a
percent
or
two
of
interest
rate
cut
or
devaluation
of
the
national
currency
the
old
Italian
trick
would
deliver
instant
salvation
After
all
Japan
has
had
0
interest
rate
for
years
and
yet
continued
to
drift
in
and
out
of
recessions
The
proper
cure
for
Germany
and
Italy
would
be
a
set
of
liberal
economic
reforms
concieved
and
implemented
by
a
competent
government
Germany
is
more
than
ready
to
be
relieved
of
the
expensive
and
rigid
social
state
which
delivered
unemployment
and
stagnation
instead
of
the
promised
leftist
utopia
the
social
justice
Well
that's
what
socialist
systems
do
in
case
you've
just
fallen
from
Mars
and
missed
the
last
50
years
of
economic
history
The
Italians
are
ready
to
be
relieved
of
the
Berlusconi's
government
which
is
most
likely
paralyzed
with
his
own
vested
interest
and
corruption
Both
German
and
Italian
voters
should
deliver
a
fatal
blow
to
the
incumbents
and
remove
them
from
the
office
Germans
are
lucky
to
have
an
alternative
in
Angela
Merkel
a
business
friendly
iron
lady
from
the
East
Regretfully
I
don't
see
such
an
alternative
in
Italy
To
come
back
to
the
opening
quote
the
Italian
marriage
without
a
get
out
of
the
jail
free
card
Isn't
this
another
fine
example
of
arrogance
of
EU
officials
lulled
in
their
EU
dream
And
it
is
not
a
lone
example
When
a
Charles
Stanley
analyst
Stuart
Thomson
interviewed
ECB
officials
they
were
dismayed
at
the
prospect
of
anyone
leaving
the
Eurozone
This
will
never
happen
We
are
building
a
currency
which
will
replace
the
Dollar
We
will
squeeze
the
Americans
out
and
make
them
pay
for
the
Euro
in
the
same
way
we
were
paying
through
60's
70's
and
80's
Wow
that's
cool
stuff
But
the
economic
success
can
not
be
achieved
by
the
force
of
political
directives
and
party
dogmas
A
democratic
body
such
as
the
EU
Commission
should
respond
with
a
debate
not
dismissal
After
all
an
elected
official
has
voiced
his
genuine
concern
for
right
or
wrong
reasons
about
the
way
the
common
currency
works
or
rather
doesn't
work
for
his
country
After
all
for
right
or
wrong
reasons
some
64
of
Germans
seem
to
think
Germany
would
be
better
off
with
the
Deutsche
Mark

Non

What
now
The
EU
constitution
is
in
trouble
In
order
for
it
to
come
to
life
it
has
to
be
ratified
by
all
of
the
25
member
states
which
is
now
unlikely
after
the
French
and
the
Dutch
referendums
The
initial
reactions
from
Brussels
were
business
as
usual
and
the
process
of
ratification
should
go
on
Why
Did
Brussels
think
the
referendums
in
France
and
Netherlands
could
be
ignored
and
the
whole
thing
kept
alive
To
understand
the
mindset
of
Brussels
bureaucrats
one
must
consider
the
doctrine
concieved
by
one
of
the
EU
founding
fathers
Jean
Monnet
A
couple
of
decades
ago
Monet
was
aware
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
integrate
European
countries
burdened
with
decades
of
conflicts
by
means
of
political
democracy
So
he
argued
that
the
critical
momentum
for
full-blown
political
unification
should
be
achieved
by
pushing
through
with
integration
on
less
controversial
levels
agriculture
common
market
and
currency
Apparently
his
guidelines
have
been
carefully
implemented
Let
us
consider
the
latter
the
crown
of
European
integration
at
least
so
far
the
almighty
Euro
for
a
moment
As
a
currency
the
Euro
doesn't
really
work
for
anyone
For
the
sclerotic
continent
the
interest
rates
are
too
high
and
do
not
foster
growth
For
thriving
economies
not
that
there
are
many
of
those
in
Europe
like
the
Irish
they
are
too
low
what
fuels
inflation
and
may
cause
the
economy
to
overheat
The
economies
of
European
countries
are
rather
diverse
and
if
there
was
to
be
a
single
currency
there
should've
been
mechanisms
in
place
to
manage
those
diversities
as
there
are
in
the
States
federal
tax-based
redistribution
system
These
were
not
put
in
place
and
could
not
have
been
put
in
place
because
political
consensus
is
required
first
But
in
this
case
the
house
was
being
built
from
the
roof
down
along
the
lines
of
Monnet's
doctrine
The
Euro
was
put
in
place
in
hope
some
sort
of
political
consensus
will
follow
But
it
seems
feeding
the
unity
down
our
throats
didn't
quite
work
for
the
French
and
for
the
Dutch
And
if
the
Eurocrats
get
it
their
way
and
the
British
get
to
vote
too
this
seems
unlikely
now
we
will
probably
find
it
didn't
quite
work
for
them
either
To
come
back
to
the
original
question
what
is
the
point
of
continuing
with
ratification
It's
because
Non
and
Nee
don't
really
matter
Voters
are
seen
as
just
a
nuisance
A
bit
of
arm-twisting
and
a
bit
of
spin
and
we
could
still
have
our
EU
super
state
whether
the
punters
like
it
or
not
In
theory
the
Dutch
parliament
could
ratify
the
Constitution
because
the
referendum
was
consultative
This
seems
unlikely
but
weirder
things
have
happened
The
French
may
get
to
vote
again
under
a
different
government
because
they
didn't
quite
understand
the
whole
thing
or
because
they
really
voted
against
Chirac
and
not
against
the
Constitution
The
Brussels
officials
wouldn't
mind
making
a
complete
mock
out
of
democracy
as
long
as
the
higher
cause
the
sacred
EU
cow
is
saved
That
explains
their
initial
reaction
denial
and
defiance
Except
for
the
idea
that
they
can
still
see
the
Constitution
through
can
you
think
of
any
other
reason
why
Brussels
would
want
the
ratification
to
go
ahead
And
that
is
why
Chirac
was
on
a
mission
convincing
others
to
give
it
a
lash
anyway
Even
our
Taoiseach
bought
into
it
He
seems
to
have
recently
changed
his
mind
and
now
wants
to
postpone
the
Irish
referendum
but
for
the
wrong
reason
not
to
reconsider
the
entire
thing
but
to
prevent
the
Irish
and
subsequently
the
others
from
saying
no
to
the
Constitution
in
some
sort
of
a
domino
effect
So
what
now
Instead
of
wondering
about
how
to
save
the
Constitution
the
EU
bureaucrats
and
the
leaders
of
EU
states
should
carefully
reflect
upon
two
crucial
issues
Do
European
countries
really
want
a
strong
political
union
beyond
the
common
market
and
the
common
currency
If
so
how
to
reconcile
the
obvious
ideological
and
economic
differences
I'm
afraid
they
would
find
that
the
common
market
was
as
good
as
it
gets
the
Euro
was
a
step
too
far
and
the
latter
is
a
mission
impossible
It
is
time
for
the
Eurocrats
to
abandon

Quo
Vadis
Europa
Anti-capitalist
rhetoric
coming
from
the
continental
Europe
these
days
is
hardly
in
short
supply
The
head
of
German
SPD
Franz
Müntefering
called
the
certain
financial
investors
swarms
of
locusts
To
prove
Franz's
ranting
is
a
policy
rather
than
merely
a
slip
the
head
of
Young
Socialists
the
SPD's
youth
organization
called
the
director
of
Deutsche
Bank
AG
a
willing
servant
of
unrestrained
capital
who
is
nothing
but
a
puppet
in
the
shark
pool
of
neoliberal
globalization
To
top
it
all
the
press
came
up
with
a
leaked
SPD's
memo
listing
the
locusts
Goldman
Sachs
Deutsche
Bank
and
a
string
of
private-equity
firms
This
is
all
great
stuff
and
Germans
are
buying
it
big
time
And
so
are
the
French
and
the
Spanish
And
selfless
as
they
are
they
want
us
to
have
some
of
that
great
stuff
too
Anybody
remembers
the
time
the
EU
finance
ministers
were
rubbing
McCreevy's
nose
for
having
low
corporate
taxes
and
stealing
business
from
their
sclerotic
economies
Remember
talks
of
harmonisation
of
taxes
Now
they're
after
the
UK
Last
week
only
days
after
Tony
Blair
was
returned
to
power
the
European
Parliament
with
support
from
many
Labour
MEPs
voted
to
end
the
UK's
opt-out
from
limits
on
working
hours
The
prime
minister
now
faces
a
fight
to
block
the
measure
The
stakes
are
very
high
the
foundation
of
Britain's
comparative
success
in
the
EU
We
have
today
started
a
long
march
in
favour
of
our
social
Europe
said
a
Spanish
Socialist
MEP
I
would
not
see
any
problem
with
all
this
if
a
heavily
regulated
economy
was
a
successful
alternative
to
a
free-market
economy
But
it's
not
A
majority
of
socialist
countries
in
Europe
feature
double-digit
unemployment
figures
and
sluggish
growth
rates
hovering
around
1.5
2.5
is
needed
to
sustain
the
growth
of
population
Even
Sweden
which
is
often
used
as
a
socialist
showcase
is
far
from
trouble
free
For
example
Sweden
slipped
from
the
fourth
place
it
held
in
70's
to
the
twelfth
place
in
OECD
countries
in
terms
of
GDP
per
capita
On
the
long
run
a
regulated
economy
fails
those
whose
interests
it
is
supposed
to
protect
At
worst
it
results
in
economic
failures
of
catastrophic
proportions
as
it
did
in
the
Soviet
Union
At
best
it
hampers
growth
and
yields
unemployment
And
the
danger
is
there
will
be
more
and
more
of
the
good
socialist
stuff
being
forced
down
our
throats
once
the
EU
constitution
gives
Kremlin
like
powers
to
Brussels
To
avoid
such
a
scenario
Ireland
and
UK
could
consider
looking
beyond
their
membership
of
the
EU
and
join
the
thriving
NAFTA
as
well

Minister
for
Justice
Michael
McDowell
spoke
on
Wednesday
about
a
huge
number
of
bogus
asylum
applications
falling
on
the
desks
of
Irish
immigration
service
officers
This
story
was
eclipsed
by
the
kebab
affair
and
the
airport
terminal
announcements
which
is
a
pity
because
Michael
has
a
point
here
Michael
McDowell
said
the
patience
of
the
Irish
people
would
be
very
tested
if
they
knew
the
cock
and
bull
stories
being
given
by
people
looking
for
asylum
McDowell
also
said
there's
a
lot
of
political
correctness
that
goes
on
here
and
it
is
manifestly
bogus
far-fetched
nonsense
and
it's
about
time
we
said
it
And
to
prove
Michael's
point
this
morning
Eamon
Dunphy
branded
his
comments
as
racist
and
then
went
on
to
say
there
were
many
African
and
Eastern
European
asylum
seekers
What
a
logical
salto
mortale
Have
Eastern
Europeans
suddenly
become
a
different
race
If
not
how
can
McDowell's
comments
be
racist
The
fact
is
that
McDowell's
comments
are
aimed
at
the
bogus
asylum
seekers
wherever
they
come
from
The
debate
on
the
issue
must
not
be
stopped
by
filibustering
about
the
language
employed
as
was
the
case
with
Myers's
comments
about

mothers
The
fact
is
that
bogus
asylum
seekers
exploit
the
good
the
naïve
the
emotional
and
the
stupid
in
this
country
They
exploit
the
system
and
they
waste
taxpayers
money
But
the
worst
of
all
failure
to
stop
these
ordinary
conmen
at

will
create
huge

It

because
all

will
be

Even
if

For

however

as

we

continue
to
grind
Galloway
and
the
likes
of
him
So
here
we
go
This
morning
following
last
night
Senate
hearing
we
had
Galloway
on
Eamon
Dunphy's
Breakfast
Show
He
argued
it
was
wrong
to
bring
sanctions
upon
Iraqi
people
just
because
we
fell
out
with
a
dictator
we
have
put
in
power
in
the
first
place
Wow
Correct
me
if
I
am
wrong
but
wasn't
the
absence
of
UN
approval
one
of
the
principal
arguments
against
the
war
in
Iraq
Well
the
sanctions
were
indeed
blessed
by
the
UN
Why
are
they
wrong
then
Or
is
it
that
the
UN
suddenly
does
not
matter
The
sanctions
killed
a
lot
of
children
Even
if
they
did
they
were
not
supposed
to
because
the
Oil
for
Food
program
was
put
in
place
so
that
the
evil
dictator
would
suffer
more
and
the
people
less
But
guess
what
this
program
was
ineffective
as
if
anything
the
UN
has
ever
done
was
effective
and
abused
by
corrupted
UN
officials
Even
the
son
of
Kofi
Annan
was
involved
himself
apparently
without
daddy's
knowledge
And
were
Galloway
and
some
French
diplomats
involved
this
remains
to
be
proven
beyond
reasonable
doubt
So
far
we
know
Galloway's
business
associate
was
involved
and
Galloway
has
yet
to
condemn
his
act
What
about
Saddam
Was
he
really
wholeheartedly
embraced
by
the
same
people
who
toppled
him
or
was
he
merely
a
lesser
evil
supported
against
a
greater
evil
at
some
stage
of
the
history
twenty
years
ago
and
under
a
completely
different
set
of
circumstances
And
did
we
put
him
in
power
or
was
it
that
he
killed
and
continued
to
kill
everyone
in
his
way
to
become
one
of
the
most
ruthless
and
oppressive
dictators
on
the
planet
Perhaps
CIA
did
provide
intelligence
in
1963
to
help
overthrow
general
Qasim
Perhaps
USA
did
assist
Saddam
after
he
attacked
Iran
But
does
that
equal
to
putting
someone
in
power
And
did
we
fall
out
with
Saddam
or
was
it
the
other
way
around
Was
it
when
USA
attacked
Iraq
or
was
it
after
Iraq
attacked
Kuwait
Why
should
Galloway
bother
with
such
minute
details
when
USA
are
always
The
Bad
or
at
least
The
Ugly
At
the
end
whatever
the
story
with
Galloway
all
efforts
should
be
focused
on
fixing
Iraq
and
creating
a
respectable
and
democratic
country
which
will
not
be
a
threat
to
its
neighbours
and
its
own
citizens
And
that
is
what
counts
at
the
end

Cooperation
Throughout
the
history
cooperation
of
people
has
proven
to
be
the
most
effective
mechanism
of
maximizing
output
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
a
common
goal
But
don't
jump
to
conclusions
I
haven't
lost
my
mind
and
turned
socialist
or
God
forbid
communist
It
is
not
any
sort
of
cooperation
I
am
talking
about
here
Two
thousand
years
of
imposed
religious
unity
did
not
yield
much
benefit
for
the
state
of
human
affairs
Thousands
of
years
of
coerced
cooperation
through
various
forms
of
slavery
did
not
yield
much
benefit
for
the
state
of
human
affairs
either
Modern-day
coercive
states
have
either
failed
already
or
are
finding
themselves
blessed
with
social
and
economical
depression
Coercive
cohesion
fails
on
the
long
run
It
is
not
the
cooperation
where
the
interests
of
individuals
are
sacrificed
for
some
common
goal
I
am
talking
about
It
is
a
cooperation
of
free
individuals
joining
together
at
their
free
will
that
yields
true
success
and
prosperity
for
all
Emergence
of
free-thinking
liberated
from
the
claws
of
Inquisition
gave
us
unprecedented
advances
in
science
Emergence
of
free-trading
enabled
for
further
flow
of
people
and
ideas
across
the
globe
to
everyone's
benefit
Emergence
of
capitalism
produced
unprecedented
wealth
for
virtually
everyone
Yes
there
are
many
poor
people
on
the
Globe
still
but
you
will
find
that
this
is
mostly
the
case
in
those
parts
of
the
world
where
personal
and
economical
freedoms
are
in
short
supply
Jeremy
Clarkson
noted
that
in
20000
years
of
human
existence
we
came
up
with
only
three
important
things
fire
wheel
and
the
fact
that
wood
floats
And
then
in
two
hundred
years
we
invented
everything
else
And
it
was
not
a
coercive
cohesion
that
facilitated
this
unprecedented
advance
It
was
freedom
of
people
to
think
act
trade
and
work
together
at
their
own
will
It
was
the
freedom
of
individuals
to

George
the
Hulk
and
Evil
Builders
Yesterday
we
heard
a
heartbreaking
story
on
Newstalk's
The
Right
Hook
Sinead
and
a
number
of
others
placed
3000
booking
deposits
to
secure
apartments
but
the
evil
developer
decided
to
pull
out
refund
the
prospective
buyers
and
rent
the
apartments
out
Although
this
was
legal
George
found
it
terribly
immoral
and
unfair
Apparently
all
of
this
meant
we
needed
a
housing
market
regulator
and
Mr
Eamon
Gilmore
was
invited
to
advertise
the
Labour's
Party
just
struggle
to
introduce
one
Why
What
would
the
regulator
have
done
in
this
particular
case
Forced
the
developer
to
do
sell
the
apartments
even
though
the
contracts
have
not
been
in
place
Nonsense
What
we
really
need
is
the
government
to
stop
messing
around
with
the
market
Little
wonder
things
seem
chaotic
when
the
government
keeps
changing
the
rules
of
the
game
every
year
And
why
was
this
immoral
Was
someone
deceived
Sinead
was
advised
by
her
solicitor
that
the
deposit
was
not
binding
and
that
the
sale
wasn't
a
done
deal
until
the
contracts
have
been
exchanged
I
suspect
other
buyers
received
the
same
advice
So
is
it
immoral
when
someone
takes
a
risk
and
doesn't
get
it
their
way
It's
hardly
unfair
either
because
the
buyers
could
have
pulled
out
too
without
any
consequence
whatsoever
leaving
the
poor
developer
out
in
the
dry
And
how
come
the
developer
has
suddenly
changed
his
mind
It
is
impossible
said
George
they
must
have
known
from
the
start
Not
really
in
fact
it's
a
business
decision
which
makes
perfect
sense
because
the
rents
in
Dublin
are
rising
again
after
three
years
That
is
what
good
companies
do
adjust
the
business
strategy
to
match
conditions
on
the
market
At
the
end
George
inadvertently
pointed
out
an
advantage
of
having
a
market
He
named
and
shamed
the
company
in
question
in
hope
the
market
forces
will
take
its
toll
by
scaring
the
punters
away
Which
I
doubt
will
happen
People
will
continue
to
place
deposits
to
buy
off
plans
because
they
pay
less
for
the
houses
and
have
a
greater
flexibility
to
sort
out
their
financial
affairs
and
indeed
pull
out
if
they
chose
to
do
so
All
of
this
brings
me
to
an
entirely
separate
issue
At
least
now
I
know
why
the
latest
ad
campaign
features
George
as
the
Hulk
apparently
smashing
what
appears
like
a
construction
site
But
why
the
hell
is
Mr
Hook's
show
called
The
Right
Hook
when
dear
old
George
is
a
bleeding
heart
liberal
Why
not

Left

Monkeys
Against
Gender
Equalization
Gender
is
a
social
construction
The
patriarchal
society
is
to
blame
for
differences
between
male
and
female
inclinations
and
achievements
These
are
the
phrases
we
hear
so
often
from
various
feminist
lobbies
and
equalization
freaks
from
all
sides
According
to
recent
studies
they
are
very
wrong
Men
and
women
are
indeed
different
It
turns
out
that
male
and
female
brains
differ
quite
a
bit
in
architecture
and
activity
Research
into
these
variations
could
lead
to
sex-specific
treatments
for
disorders
such
as
depression
and
schizophrenia
To
prove
male
and
female
inborn
inclinations
do
exist
scientists
turned
to
monkeys
and
guess
what
happened
male
monkeys
spent
more
time
playing
with
the
masculine
toys
than
their
female
counterparts
did
and
female
monkeys
spent
more
time
interacting
with
the
playthings
typically
preferred
by
girls
Both
sexes
spent
equal
time
monkeying
with
the
picture
books
and
other
gender-neutral
toys
Findings
like
these
prove
that
many
lefty
policies
from
supporting
the
concept
of
homosexual
family
as
equal
to
a
traditional
one
to
forced
equality
through
gender
based
quotas
are
just
plain
wrong

The
Importance
of
Capital
It
is
often
argued
that
scientists
and
technical
innovators
are
underpaid
given
their
importance
in
advancing
our
civilisation
This
is
particularly
so
when
compared
to
those
evil
investment
bankers
and
stock
brokers
who
produce
nothing
in
return
for
big
bucks
In
his
book
Man
Economy
and
State
Rothbard
argues
that
inventions
are
meaningless
until
capital
is
invested
to
put
them
in
use
He
claims
there
is
always
an
unused
shelf
of
technological
projects
available
and
idle
Why
idle
in
order
for
the
new
invention
to
be
used
more
capital
must
be
invested
Commercialization
is
not
a
technically
trivial
exercise
It
makes
the
crucial
difference
between
a
useful
and
useless
invention
and
rightly
so
those
who
facilitate
commercialization
are
rewarded
If
you
are
for
technological
progress
and
its
wide
availability
then
you
should
be
an
enthusiastic
supporter
of
capital
accumulation
and
its
rational
investment
That
is
you
should
be
for
the
free
market

Airbus
to
Lose
Money
on
A380
An
American
study
suggests
Airbus
will
lose
8
billion
over
the
commercial
life
of
the
A380
and
will
never
repay
4
billion
of
subsidies
paid
by
the
EU
taxpayers
This
is
not
the
first
time
someone
suggested
projected
sales
of
A380
were
overly
optimistic
Airbus
bets
that
the
existing
hub
system
for
which
the
A380
is
designed
will
prevail
although
point-to-point
flights
preferred
by
the
punters
and
the
low
cost
airlines
are
on
the
rise
If
Airbus
lose
this
will
be
the
second
time
the
EU
governments
tried
to
pick
a
market
winner
in
the
airline
industry
Concorde
was
the
first
attempt
and
failed
while
gambling
away
the
taxpayers
money
Which
is
fine
except
no
one
has
ever
asked
the
taxpayers
if
they
wish
to

The
Pope
and
Condoms
Apparently
the
Catholic
Church
is
to
blame
for
rampaging
AIDS
in
Africa
According
to
some
activists
shown
in
a
piece
on
the
Sky
News
if
only
the
Catholic
priests
urged
the
African
men
to
use
condoms
they
might
listen
Of
course
it's
all
late
Pope
Jon
Paul
II
fault
If
only
he
hadn't
be
so
conservative
They
failed
to
notice
that
the
Catholic
Church
is
against
sex
outside
of
the
marriage
So
if
one
follows
the
teaching
of
the
Church
one
is
unlikely
to
contract
AIDS
and
one
needs

Expensive
Green
Policies
It
appears
now
that
building
wind
farms
is
not
a
very
cost
effective
way
of
providing
sustainable

environmentally
friendly
energy
The
trouble
is
that
wind
sometimes
blows
and
sometimes
does
not
so
electricity
suppliers
need
to
operate
reserve
generation
and
taking
that
into
account
wind
energy
becomes
very
expensive
Apparently
building
energy-efficient
houses
saves
more
energy
and
money
However
no
one
seems

We

and

Economic
Inequality
and
Global
Terrorism
As
advocates
of
the
left
often
do
Professor
Frances
Stewart
argued
some
time
ago
Letters
Financial
Times
19thMarch
2004
in
the
Financial
Times
that
economic
inequality
between
the
West
and
the
Arab
states
is
the
root
cause
of
terrorism
She
concluded
that
the
West
should
be
looking
for
the
ways
to
fight
terrorism
by
eradicating
poverty
Is
that
really
so
While
the
overall
outlook
of
an
average
Palestinian
is
gloomy
the
overall
outlook
of
an
average
Ethiopian
or
a
Bangladeshi
is
not
much
better
either
It
is
worse
as
a
matter
of
fact
However
Bangladesh
Ethiopia
Albania
and
a
number
of
other
poor
countries
have
remained
virtually
free
of
terrorists
On
the
other
hand
Saudi
Arabia
the
homeland
of
the
majority
of
9/11
bombers
can
hardly
be
considered
a
poor
country
Although
its
economy
has
suffered
decline
in
the
last
three
decades
the
current
GDP
per

of
Saudi
Arabia
measures
up
to
those
of
the
countries
recently
joined
the
EU
The
masterminds
of
global
terrorism
are
hardly
a
bunch
of
deprived
and
uneducated
lads
On
the
opposite
Osama
bin
Laden
enjoyed
a
rather
luxurious
lifestyle
as
a
member
of
one
of
the
richest
families
in
the
West
of
Saudi
Arabia
before
he
decided
to
venture
into
Afghani
mountains
to
fight
infidels
People
like
Yasser
Arafat
or
late
Sheikh
Yassin
raised
and
spent
millions
of
dollars
on
bombs
not
on
the
welfare
of
their
oppressed
countrymen
Saudi
Arabia
home
of
the
financial
supporters
of
terrorists
rich
Sheiks
another
deprived
lot
waited
for
the
West
to
provide
basic
relief
to
the
poor
Muslims
in
the
Tsunami
affected
areas
and
then
donated
money
to
build
mosques
Were
they
all
troubled
by
economic
deprivation
or
perhaps
suffered
from
it
I
don't
think
so
So
is
Professor
Stewart
right
Should
we
fight
terrorism
by
fighting
poverty
Not
really
The
root
cause
of
the
recent
upsurge
of
terrorism
is
in
the
religious
intolerance
of
the
Muslim
fanatics
How
best
to
fight
it
By
bringing
down
totalitarian
societies
in
which
extremes
of
all
kinds
flourish
in
the
absence
of
political
liberty
to
express
their
ideas
If
a
political
force
is
driven
outside
of
political
institutions
of
the
state
it
is
likely
to
resort
to
terrorism
to
get
their
message
across
Put
them
into
the
Parliament
and
the
violence
is
likely
to
stop
This
was
largely
the
case
with
the
likes
of
IRA
and
extreme
European
left
of
the
70's
Rebellious
students
former
members
of
Baader
Meinhof
and
Brigate
Rosse
today
vote
for
various
European
Socialist
parties
Today
the
likes
of
Martin
McGuiness
the
former
highly
ranked
IRA
officer
are
political
figures
Yes
I
am
suggesting
here
that
even
religious
fanatics
should
be
allowed
to
participate
in
the
political
life
Of
course
the
prerequisite
is
dismantling
of
oppressive
regimes
and
creation
of
political
pluralism
the
creation
of
a
parliamentary
democracy
However
since
religious
fanatics
are
and
will
remain
intolerant
until
they
reach
political
maturity
as
the
European
extreme
left
did
to
an
extent
though
although
their
ideas
are
still
utterly
stupid
and
destructive
at
least
they
don't
use
bombs
any
more
there
should
be
strong
mechanisms
in
support
of
tolerance
and
pluralism
in
those
baby-democracies
The
power-sharing
needs
to
be
carefully
balanced
to
prevent
the
intolerant
lot
from
prevailing
And
because
the
supporters
of
religious
fanatics
are
numerous
these
protection
mechanisms
should
be
imposed
upon
the
baby-democracies
from
the
outside
All
of
this
sounds
familiar
Well
this
is
exactly
what
is
currently
being
done
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
It
will
take
decades
to
transform
those
basket-case
societies
under
the
supervision
of
the
West
into
democracies
where
religious
and
other
extremes
are
on
the
margins
of
the
political
life
However
painful
this
process
may
be
whatever
it
may
cost
and
however
long
it
will
take
this
is
exactly
the
right
thing
to
do
and
will
yield
long-term
benefits
in
spite
of
current
obstacles
Funny
enough
even
though
the
left
is
against
terrorism
and
for
democracy
at
least
that's
where
their
mouth
is
they
fiercely
oppose
such
measures
without
offering
a
viable
alternative
In
fact
they
do
not
offer
an
altarnative
at
all
They
seem
to
like
the
dictators
and
the
terrorists
To
really
support
the
fight
against
terrorism
the
left
should
be
doing
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
they
are
doing
at
the
moment
They
should
stop
supporting
dictators
which
are
good
guys
as
long
as
they
are
against
the
US
and
side
with
the
efforts
aimed
towards
achieving
political
pluralism
in
the
countries
like
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
Let
us
hope
economic
liberalisation
will
follow
Economic
liberalisation
usually
reduces
inequality
which
is
something
Professor
Stewart
should
certainly
look
forward
to
That
is
if
Professor
Stewart
really
wants
to
eradicate
poverty
and
is
not
just
looking
for
another
way
to
redistribute
wealth
impoverish
the
West
and
make
everyone
equal

Critique
of
Pure
Reason
It
is
sad
that
the
public
outrage
over
the
choice
of
language
Kevin
Myers
sported
in
his
column
in
The
Irish
Times
had
brought
to
a
halt
any
debate
about
the
issues
he
had
raised
in
relation
to
the
state
sponsorship
of
single
parenthood
Was
it
appropriate
for
Myers
to
use
the
word
bastard
Probably
not
Was
Myers
right
to
claim
that
the
system
of
benefits
to
unmarried
mothers
is
creating
a
long-term
time-bomb
Was
he
right
to
claim
the
welfare
system
is
creating
benefits-addicted
fatherless
families
who
will
be
raised
in
a
culture
of
personal
and
economic
apathy
and
from
such
warped
timber
true
masts
are
seldom
hewn
Amazingly
that
seems
irrelevant
I
could
go
on
to
describe
virtues
of
the
traditional
family
but
that'd
only
get
me
branded
as
just
another
ranting
backwards
conservative
bastard
I
could
go
on
as
Myers
did
to
the
same
effect
claiming
that
using
public
money
to
encourage
people
to
depart
from
traditional
family
is
utterly
stupid
and
self-destructive
form
of
social
engineering
which
will
yield
nothing
but
problems
in
the
future
However
I
don't
have
to
do
that
Kevin
Myers
didn't
have
to
do
that
An
American
sociologist
Charles
Murray
did
it
a
decade
and
a
half
ago
in
response
to
pro-single-parenthood
policies
championed
in
Britain
at
the
time
When
I
was
looking
at
Britain
in
the
1980s
the
offspring
of
the
first
big
generation
of
single
mothers
were
small
children
now
they
are
teenagers
and
young
adults
and
the
problems
are
exactly
those
that
I
was
warning
they
would
be
high
crime
rates
and
low
participation
in
the
labour
force
These
people
have
never
been
socialised
and
they
simply
don't
know
how
to
behave
from
sitting
still
in
classrooms
to
knowing
you
don't
hit
people
if
you
have
a
problem
For
his
words
Murray
was
vilified
sixteen
years
ago
in
the
same
way
Myers
was
recently
torn
apart
until
he
and
quite
unusually
for
The
Irish
Times
the
Editor
apologized
Murray
however
got
satisfaction
in
words
of
Tony
Blair
Single
mothers
are
piling
up
problems
for
the
future
said
Tony
in
a
public
speech
a
few
weeks
ago
The
full
article
is
here
So
Murray
was
right
Myers
is
right
Does
this
matter
It
does
not
Will
this
ignite
a
public
debate
on
the
issue
It
will
not
No
Irish
media
has
even
attempted
to
bring
Murray
and
Myers
in
correlation
It
appears
to
me
the
article
in
The
Times
has
had
virtually
no
impact
at
all
Is
this
important
for
the
future
of
all
of
us
Of
course
it
is
This
is
a
cleat
proof
like
we
needed
one
in
the
first
place
that
liberals
are
wrong
when
they
offer
a
single-parent
family
as
a
perfectly
viable
alternative
to
a
traditional
family
This
is
true
for
homosexual
families
as
well
but
I
am
afraid
we
will
have
to
wait
a
decade
or
two
to
get
a
living
proof
as
well
In
the
meantime
leftist
feel-good
use-no-brains
tax-those-creating-wealth
and
throw-more-money-at-the-problem
policies
are
likely
to
persist
in
spite
of
the
pure
reason

Evil
Capitalism
I
was
appalled
the
other
day
listening
to
George
Hook
on
Newstalk
106
Good
auld
George
said
something
like
we
used
to
be
afraid
of
communists
perhaps
now
we
should
be
afraid
of
capitalists
What
was
the
issue
A
Turkish
based
company
GAMA
Construction
was
paying
Turkish
workers
in
Ireland
less
then
the
going
rate
imposed
upon
the
industry
by
the
syndicate
and
less
than
the
national
minimum
wage
Well
first
of
all
two
hundred
years
of
capitalism
have
produced
unprecedented
wealth
not
only
for
the
rich
but
also
for
the
masses
It
seems
to
me
that
being
afraid
of
something
that
made
us
all
rich
is
a
bit
irrational
Second
of
all
we
were
right
to
be
scared
of
commies
because
they
were
murderous
bastards
Comparing
them
to
a
company
which
paid
immigrant
workers
less
than
the
going
rate
is
not
only
stupid
but
rather
nasty
Why
should
the
minimum
wage
apply
in
this
or
any
similar
case
at
all
The
minimum
wage
does
not
take
the
differences
in
the
cost
of
living
into
account
Turkish
workers
are
happy
to
work
much
below
the
minimum
wage
because
a
three-bed
semi
in
the
suburbs
of
Ankara
costs
as
much
as
a
deposit
on
a
three-bed
semi
in
Dublin
I
see
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
hiring
foreign
workers
and
paying
them
whatever
they
are
willing
to
work
for
Some
may
suggest
paying
below
the
going
rate
is
exploitation
but
is
there
any
other
point
in
bringing
foreign
workers
in
except
to
bring
down
costs
of
running
a
business
To
top
it
all
George
complained
that
the
company
in
question
was
able
to
bid
lower
than
the
competition
How
dare
them
being
cheap
in
the
middle
of
the
rip-off
Ireland
where
Irish
brick-layers
are
paid
Euro
2500
to
3000
a
week
I
didn't
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
What
a
load
of
rubbish
Let
us
see
at
the
end
what
will
the
net
result
of
this
frenzy
against
GAMA
Construction
be
The
Turkish
workers
will
go
home
and
will
not
make
any
money
any
more
GAMA
Construction
will
probably
close
or
scale
down
its
operation
in
Ireland
In
any
case
it
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
bid
on
the
cheap
side
for
construction
works
any
more
We
will
end
up
paying
more
for
what
already
is
ludicrously
expensive
We
all
lose
Never
mind
As
long
as
the
bleeding
hearts
are
satisfied
