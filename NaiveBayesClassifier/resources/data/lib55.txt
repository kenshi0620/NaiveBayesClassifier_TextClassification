A
New
Hope
So...as
you
may
have
noticed
I
write
a
bunch
of
blogs
Well
those
days
are
coming
to
an
end
When
I'm
done
guest-hosting
for
Josh
at
Talking
Points
Memo
this
week
I
won't
be
rejoining
TPM
Caf
no
hard
feelings
it's
just
what
I
thought
would
be
the
best
situation
for
me
Similarly
at
the
end
of
this
week
I'm
going
on
leave
from
The
American
Prospect
to
work
on
another
project
I'll
keep
writing
my
weekly
column
for
TAP
Online
and
depending
on
how
things
shake
out
I
may
do
some
pieces
for
the
print
magazine
but
I
won't
be
contributing
to
Tapped
for
a
while
Simultaneously
this
blog
is
shutting
down
as
of
now
No
more
posts
here
Instead
I'm
relaunching
MatthewYglesias.com
new
design
by
Tom
Lee
and
come
Labor
Day
Weekend
that
will
be
for
the
immediate
future
at
least
the
sole
blogospheric
outlet
of
yours
truly
You'll
see
the
political
content
of
my
professional
blogs
plus
the
sports
culture
and
miscellany
you
find
here
Hopefully
some
posts
will
combine
those
interests
Dividing
the
blogs
up
had
a
kind
of
professional
and
business
rationale
but
I
think
it
hurts
the
quality
of
the
editorial
product
which
is
best
served
up
as
a
unified
entity
It'll
also
make
the
work
more
manageable
for
me
The
new
site's
RSS
feed
is
here
If
for
some
reason
you
only
come
for
the
basketblogging
soon
to
be
joined
by
some
footballblogging
you
can
find
the
sports-only
feed
here
If
more
plausibly
you
find
the
sport
stuff
annoying
you
can
find
a
non-sports
feed
here

Time
to
Reconsider
I'm
not
sure
if
you
guys
know
who
Richard
Quest
is
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
based
on
my
rather
small
level
of
watching
CNN
International
while
traveling
he's
far
and
away
the
most
annoying
television
news
personality
on
the
planet
Or
else
if
you're
Catherine
he's
totally
and
completely
adorable
and
hilarious
I
don't
think
we
can
be
friends
anymore

Staying
Over
A
letter-writer
to
Slate
explains
that
her
teenage
son
has
his
first
girlfriend
and
that
they've
forbidden
him
from
having
the
girl
spend
the
night
at
their
house
Only
problem
the
girl's
parents
let
him
stay
over
at
their
house
What
to
do
Some
parents
feel
that
as
long
as
behavior
they
don't
entirely
approve
of
is
taking
place
under
their
roof
underage
drinking
taping
sessions
of
Girls
Gone
Wild
they
are
in
control
of
it
But
these
two
teenagers
are
minors
and
you
have
an
obligation
to
set
the
standards
for
your
son's
behavior
He
makes
quite
a
case
for
his
maturity
He
throws
a
tantrum
then
pouts
As
for
you
what's
the
point
of
having
old-fashioned
values
if
you're
not
going
to
enforce
them
You
need
to
have
a
talk
with
the
girl's
parents
Don't
be
either
defensive
or
self-righteous
just
say
your
son
is
not
allowed
to
sleep
at
their
house
Yes
your
son
will
be
angry
but
what
you
are
doing
is
not
just
for
now
but
for
when
he
is
a
parent
and
can
draw
on
the
lessons
you
taught
him
about
standing
firm.But
what
about
the
parents
substantive
views
here
I
understand
that
there
position
is
fairly
widespread
though
it
certainly
wasn't
current
among
the
parents
at
the
den
of
immorality
where
I
went
to
high
school
And
what's
the
logic
of
the
anti-sleepover
position
Teen
sex
is
fine
but
seen
post-coital
cuddling
must
be
stopped
Or
at
a
minimum
curtailed
Why
would
you
think
that
What
exactly
is
the
problem
here

Race
War
Is
this
for
real
Survivor
to
segregate
teams
by
race
This
reminds
me
of
my
longstanding
awesome-but-never-gonna-happen
plan
to
eliminate
the
lame
Eastern
Conference
versus
Western
Conference
concept
in
the
NBA
All-Star
Game
Instead
you
field
the
Black
Team
and
the
Other
Team
Sure
it
sounds
a
little
absurd
but
Yao
Ming
Dirk
Nowitzki
Andrei
Kirlenko
Manu
Ginobili
and
Steve
Nash
is
a
solid
starting
squad
for
Team
Other
Sadly
this
is
a
kind
of
offensive
concept
and
probably
can't
be
brought
off
the
ground
But
since
there
are
no
Americans
on
my
proposed
non-black
starting
lineup
and
I
don't
think
any
foreigners
would
crack
the
all-black
starting
five
you
could
reconfigure
this
around
the
less-inflammatory
USA
versus
World
concept
Does
the
switch
make
a
big
difference
I
think
it
only
matters
at
point
guard
where
white
American
Kirk
Hinrich
is
a
backup
on
a
non-black
team
but
not
an
all-American
team
and
black
Frenchman
Tony
Parker
is
a
backup
on
an
all-foreign
team
but
not
an
all-black
team

Why
Yes
I
am
An
Asshole
Over
at
Tapped
Ben
Adler
misses
the
point
about
this
Washington
Post
article
The
whole
concept
that
there's
some
kind
of
big
three
universities
in
the
United
States
Harvard
Yale
and
Princeton
is
a
foolish
Tiger
construct
There's
Harvard
there's
an
Ivy
League
and
there's
a
Harvard-Yale
rivalry
Number
one
US
News
ranking
or
not
Princeton
simply
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
these
efforts
to
pull
away
from
the
Brown-Columbia-Dartmouth-Cornell-Penn
pack
are
frankly
unseemly
Yes
yes
it's
rude
but
that's
the
way
it
is
Copious
research
indicate
that
college
choice
is
in
fact
unimportant
for
life
outcomes
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
relevant
considerations
are
a
cost
b
weather
c
snob
factor
and
that
New
Jersey
school
just
can't
compare
to
Harvard
and
Yale
in
category

What's
Not
Wrong
With
Deadwood
This
post
starts
out
as
some
wrongheaded
Deadwood-bashing
and
then
veers
off
into
total
madness
Part
of
the
problem
for
me
I'm
sure
is
just
the
setting
In
fact
I
think
setting
accounts
for
a
lot
of
the
differences
in
taste
in
TV
shows
that
we've
been
talking
about
lately
No
matter
how
awesome
Buffy
might
be
the
hocus-pocus
and
fight
scenes
just
bore
me
Ditto
Battlestar
Galactica
which
I've
watched
enough
to
know
is
really
well
done
but
which
bores
me
because
spaceships
and
laser
guns
bore
me.For
one
thing
there
are
no
laser
guns
in
Battlestar
What's
more
spaceships
are
a
great
setting
for
a
show
because
they're
just
like
submarines
especially
when
not
equipped
with
lasers
and
submarines
are
the
best
setting
imaginable
Plus
who
finds
fighting
boring
In
comments
we
learn
that
this
would
be
the
very
same
person
who
says
Deadwood's
dialogue
seems
unremarkable
to
me
I
can
imagine
someone
who
doesn't
enjoy
the
dialogue
but
unremarkable
Was
he
watching
I
should
say
that
personally
I'm
growing
increasingly
disgruntled
with
Deadwood
I
love
the
obviously
remarkable
dialogue
The
setting
is
interesting
There's
good
themes
good
characters
solid
acting
all
to
the
good
But
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
lowbrow
consideration
of
story
is
important
Season
Three
seems
to
be
running
with
a
decent
one
but
it
suffers
from
egregious
pacing
problems
and
lots
and
lots
of
disconnected
stuff
I
know
from
experience
debating
the
relative
merits
of
the
later
Sopranos
seasons
that
not
everyone
agrees
with
me
about
this
but
I
think
the
sort
of
lassitude
we're
seeing
in
Deadwood
3
is
the
characteristic
flaw
of
the
better
i.e
HBO-style
if
not
literally
on
HBO
programs
The
shows
get
made
at
least
in
part
because
the
writers
will
able
to
pitch
a
coherent
well-done
story
arc
along
with
various
other
good
qualities
Once
that
initial
arc
is
done
the
show's
other
merits
are
still
with
it
but
the
deployment
of
a
solid
story
arc
needs
to
be
done
all
over
again
And
it's
hard
to
do
The
temptation
becomes
to
slow
down
the
action
and
basically
stretch
your
plotting
out
as
far
as
it
will
go
and
just
lean
on
well-executed
more-or-less
random
scenes
to
fill
out
your
screen
time
This
generates
decent
results
when
done
by
good
writers
and
actors
but
it's
still
unsatisfying
in
a
way
that
tighter
stuff
isn't

Away
We
Go
Jacqueline
Massey
Paisley
Passey
suggests
I
realize
that
some
of
you
will
find
this
post
depressing
because
you'll
realize
that
you
don't
qualify
as
a
high
quality
man
and
thus
won't
be
able
to
get
a
high
quality
woman
You
have
a
few
options
2
Look
in
the
developing
world
If
you're
literate
with
a
home
computer
and
an
internet
connection
you
are
very
wealthy
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
world
Citizenship
or
legal
permanent
residency
in
a
rich
country
makes
you
more
attractive
to
women
in
poorer
countries
Your
value
on
the
dating
market
is
thus
much
higher
there.Cryptic
Ned
observes
I
thought
her
second
suggestion
was
a
good
reminder
It's
amazing
that
virtually
anyone
who's
struggling
in
America
could
move
to
a
town
in
the
developing
world
and
instantly
have
wealth
and
power
w.r.t
everyone
around
him
and
yet
nobody
does
Where's
our
conquering
settler
spirit?Some
people
however
actually
do
do
this
Years
ago
there
was
a
series
of
long
posts
on
the
Thorn
Tree
by
an
ex-pat
in
Alma
Ata
He
was
amazing
because
he
was
completely
upfront
about
being
a
despicable
person
He
was
entirely
aware
that
he
was
living
up
to
the
worst
of
himself
he'd
resigned
himself
to
the
trap
of
living
well
in
a
third
world
country
He
hated
Alma
Ata
thought
it
was
an
ugly
soviet
concrete
city
He
hated
Russians
and
Kazakhs
alike
for
being
racist
peasant
gangsters
He
was
bored
shitless
at
his
do-nothing
job
for
some
aid
agency
He
despised
himself
for
whoring
couldn't
remember
the
last
time
he'd
fucked
a
girl
who
liked
him
or
could
have
refused
his
relative
wealth
and
power
And
yet
he
knew
he
would
stay
as
long
as
he
could
He
couldn't
resist
the
advantage
he
got
just
for
being
American
it
was
all
too
easy
In
Alma
Ata
he
was
important
enough
to
include
in
the
nightly
drinking
with
the
big
boys
He
was
fucking
more
and
more
beautiful
women
than
he
thought
he
could
even
approach
at
home
He
could
live
cheap
and
have
a
maid
and
a
driver
and
eat
well
except
that
he
hated
Kazakh
food
He
had
no
demands
on
him
no
civic
life
in
a
land
where
he
was
an
irrelevant
stranger
no
family
to
demand
his
attention
not
even
the
daily
chores
of
living.Food
for
thought
Sounds
like
a
bad
dude
Surely
this
is
the
main
theme
of
one
of
the
many
well-known
vaguely
contemporary
novels
I
haven't
read
If
so
let
me
know
I
think
I'd
like
to
read
that
one

Going
Native
A
friend's
in
vising
from
out
of
town
this
weekend
and
he
rather
thoughtfully
brought
me
some
proper
New
York-style
bagels
with
the
hard
crusts
like
you
can't
get
here
in
DC
Naturally
enough
I
decided
to
cut
and
toast
one
this
morning
for
breakfast
Less
naturally
I
totally
forgot
how
to
operate
on
a
bagel
of
that
consistency
and
sliced
one
of
the
fingers
on
my
left
hand
pretty
nicely
Apparently
you
can
take
the
NYC
out
of
the
boy

Snakes
On
a
Plane
It
was
surprisingly
warm-hearted
you
know
Saw
it
in
a
sold-out
theater
with
a
pretty
giant
crew
as
outlined
here
Everyone
was
having
a
good
time
The
dude
who
played
Eddie
Kim
struck
me
as
turning
in
a
notably
worse
performance
than
everyone
else
in
the
film
which
was
a
little
curious
since
it's
not
like
the
standards
were
notably
high
to
begin
