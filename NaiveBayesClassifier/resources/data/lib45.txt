What
Does
Dick
Cheney
Think
About
Sarah
Palin's
Qualifications
to
be
Vice
President
I
miss
Dick
Cheney
I
never
thought
I
would
ever
say
those
words
not
in
a
million
years
But
that
was
before
I
knew
about
Sarah
Palin
The
Obama
campaign
needs
to
step
it
up
Because
a
McCain-Palin
presidency
won't
just
be
more
of
the
same
as
Bush-Cheney
it
will
be
a
whole
lot
worse
John
McCain
has
set
the
dogs
loose
In
a
desperate
and
cynical
quest
for
power
McCain
has
reignited
the
culture
wars
If
the
election
is
about
the
Republican
record
on
the
economy
or
the
war
in
Iraq
John
McCain
loses
But
if
the
election
is
about
abortion
or
gay
marriage
if
the
election
is
about
real
Americans
vs
the
angry
left
John
McCain
might
hang
on
in
conservative
swing
states
like
Ohio
and
eke
out
a
victory
But
Sarah
Palin
will
be
one
heartbeat
away
from
the
Presidency
and
I'll
bet
that
keeps
John
McCain
up
at
night
Tonight
while
Sarah
Palin
was
reading
a
speech
written
by
her
new
friends
on
the
teleprompter
Dick
Cheney
was
in
the
Republic
of
Georgia
on
a
mission
ordered
by
President
George
W
Bush
to
reinforce
alliances
and
reassure
leaders
in
Azerbaijan
Georgia
and
Ukraine
of
U.S
support
According
to
the
White
House
while
he
is
there
the
Vice
President
will
meet
with
President
Saakashvili
to
discuss
the
implications
of
the
crisis
with
Russia
Apparently
the
Vice
President
knows
President
Saakashvili
well
Vice
President
Cheney
and
President
Saakashvili
are
also
expected
to
discuss
the
need
for
a
comprehensive
long-term
strategy
by
the
international
community
to
help
Georgia
recover
and
rebuild
including
the
critical
task
of
supporting
the
democratic
choice
of
the
Georgian
people
to
integrate
further
with
Euro-Atlantic
institutions
including
NATO
I
don't
think
there
will
be
a
teleprompter
in
the
room
And
so
I'd
like
to
know
one
thing
what
does
Dick
Cheney
think
about
Sarah
Palin's
qualifications
to
be
Vice-President
We
will
never
get
a
straight
answer
and
given
Cheney's
track
record
I
might
be
inclined
to
agree
that
experience
is
a
little
over
rated
But
Cheney's
resume
looks
a
little
different
than
Palin's
When
Cheney
was
elected
with
Bush
in
2000
he
had
served
as
White
House
Chief
of
Staff
been
a
five-term
congressman
with
a
stint
as
House
Minority
Whip
and
served
as
Secretary
of
Defense
Then
there
was
that
gig
as
CEO
for
that
little
company
called
Haliburton
In
announcing
Mr
Cheney
selection
as
his
vice
presidential
candidate
then
candidate
George
W
Bush
was
quoted
in
the
New
York
Times
saying
I
picked
him
because
he
is
without
a
doubt
fully
capable
of
being
the
president
of
the
United
States
The
defeated
Republican
candidate
John
McCain
sais
He
has
an
incredibly
impressive
resume
adding
Mr
Cheney's
leadership
skills
are
proven
in
many
areas
I
don't
care
if
Sarah
Palin
comes
across
as
a
co-star
with
Paris
Hilton
in
the
reality
show
The
Simple
Life
And
I
don't
think
that
her
unmarried
pregnant
teenage
daughter
has
anything
to
do
with
Sarah
Palin's
readiness
to
be
vice
president
But
then
neither
do
I
think
that
being
a
hockey
mom
or
PTA
council
member
have
done
much
for
her
readiness
either
What
it
really
comes
down
to
is
Sarah
Palin's
experience
I
know
the
McCain
camp
likes
to
point
out
that
she
was
Mayor
of
a
small
town
in
Alaska
and
is
the
chief
executive
of
the
largest
state
in
the
nation
But
Wasillia
is
a
town
with
about
6,700
people
and
Alaska
has
the
second
smallest
population
about
670,000
of
any
state
in
the
nation
Nineteen
American
cities
have
more
people
Surely
one
of
them
must
have
a
Republican
Mayor
that
John
McCain
could
have
picked
as
his
running
mate

Did
McCain
Feed
Sarah
Palin
to
the
Wolves
You
can't
make
shit
like
this
up
If
I
had
written
last
week
that
John
McCain
would
pick
a
moose
hunting
former
member
of
the
Alaskan
Independence
party
whose
unmarried
teenage
daughter
is
five
months
pregnant
as
his
choice
for
vice
president
my
friends
would
have
thought
I
was
using
way
too
much
LSD
But
here
we
are
for
whatever
reason
with
Sarah
Palin
the
former
Mayor
of
Wasila
pop
6700
give
or
take
a
few
and
governor
of
Alaska
for
the
past
20
months
as
the
potential
leader
of
the
free
world
The
Republicans
insist
she
has
the
experience
to
do
the
job
if
Dick
Cheney's
performance
is
the
benchmark
maybe
they
are
right
John
McCain
in
a
one-on
one
interview
with
Brian
Williams
insisted
she
was
ready
citing
her
experience
as
the
chief
executive
of
the
second
largest
state
in
the
nation
city
mayor
hockey
mom
and
member
of
the
PTA
Maybe
he
was
just
too
stunned
for
words
but
Williams
let
McCain
roll
right
over
him
with
that
one
Note
to
Williams
you
might
have
wanted
to
point
out
that
Alaska
is
the
largest
state
but
it
has
the
second
smallest
population
about
600,000
of
any
state
in
the
nation
Twenty-Two
American
cities
including
Milwaukee
and
and
El
Paso
have
bigger
populations
He
might
have
at
least
asked
her
if
she
ran
the
PTA
raffle
or
something
Personally
I
think
the
Palin
pick
was
the
brain
child
of
some
right
wing
Karl
Rove
wanna-be
who
figured
out
that
they
needed
to
make
the
election
about
something
else
besides
the
Bush
record
on
the
economy
and
the
war
in
Iraq
By
getting
all
those
evangelical
anti-abortion
voters
all
frothed
up
maybe
they
could
pull
out
another
win
in
Ohio
If
I
had
to
guess
and
why
not
I'd
say
that
McCain
got
pissed
off
by
all
the
pressure
from
the
religious
right
over
his
interest
in
picking
Joe
Lieberman
and
decided
to
let
them
have
their
way
knowing
he
was
going
to
feed
her
to
the
wolves

Sarah
Palin
abortion
moves
to
the
forefront
When
you
can't
win
on
the
economy
and
you
can't
win
on
national
security
turn
to
the
social
issues
and
try
and
divide
the
country
This
is
right
out
of
Karl
Rove's
playbook
John
McCains
pick
of
the
heretofore
almost
unknown
Sarah
Palin
as
his
pick
for
VP
is
about
one
thing
abortion
As
the
republicans
did
by
making
gay
marriage
the
hot
button
issue
in
2004
they
are
hoping
that
the
pick
of
Palin
will
mobliize
the
religious
right
and
voters
in
ohio
and
other
more
conservative
states
will
vote
for
McCain
on
the
abortion
issue
more
later

Republicans
Aim
to
Blame
Democrats
for
High
Gas
Prices
Talking
Points
Mirror
Public
Opinion
Research
Paid
for
through
Indian
Tribe
Contributions
arranged
by
Jack
Abramoff
During
her
Senate
career
Kay
Bailey
Hutchinson
has
been
little
more
than
paid
shill
to
the
oil
and
gas
industry
and
last
weekend's
performance
was
no
different
She
appeared
on
Fox
News
to
blame
Democrats
for
high
gas
prices
and
call
for
the
expansion
of
oil
drilling
I
would
not
have
expected
anything
else
from
Hutchinson
But
in
the
interest
of
being
Fair
and
Balanced
Fox
news
anchor
Chris
Wallace
might
have
pointed
out
to
his
viewers
that
during
the
2006
election
cycle
Hutchinson
was
the
leading
recipient
of
Oil
and
Gas
Industry
largess
pulling
in
323,186
according
to
the
Center
for
Responsive
Politics
During
her
career
in
the
Senate
she
has
received
more
than
2
million
in
campaign
contributions
from
the
oil
and
gas
industry
making
her
the
top
congressional
recipient
since
1990
No
one
should
be
surprised
by
what
Hutchinson
said
but
it
is
worth
noting
that
her
talking
points
sound
a
lot
like
the
work
of
the
Council
of
Republicans
for
Environmental
Advocacy
CREA
a
now
defunct
Republican
green-scam
group
connected
to
Jack
Abramoff
and
ill-gotten
Indian
tribe
donations
Hutchinson's
comments
on
gas
prices
and
those
of
other
Republicans
mirror
public
opinion
research
from
May
2001
provided
by
CREA
to
then
Interior
Secretary
Gayle
Norton
and
apparently
the
Cheney
energy
taskforce
emphasizing
the
use
of
rising
gas
prices
to
promote
increased
drilling
The
research
concludes
language
that
emphasizes
price
increases
in
gasoline
and
natural
gas
and
the
California
situation
resonates
with
voters
and
makes
the
case
that
Gasoline
price
stability
is
the
single
most
potent
argument
for
opening
up
the
Alaskan
National
Wilderness
Refuge
Clearly
Hutchinson
will
not
be
the
only
one
trying
to
burn
the
Democrats
on
gasoline
prices
The
Republicans
desperate
for
any
advantage
in
what
looks
to
be
a
losing
election
cycle
are
aiming
to
blame
Democrats
for
high
gas
prices
and
do
the
bidding
of
their
suitors
by
pressing
for
increased
drilling
Presumptive
nominee
John
McCain
has
abandoned
what
little
remained
of
his
independent
streak
in
energy
policy
calling
for
increased
drilling
off
the
coast
of
California
in
the
hope
it
will
play
well
with
pick-up
truck
voters
in
Ohio
and
Pennsylvania
Just
for
the
record
McCain
has
received
791,777
in
oil
and
gas
industry
contributions
in
2008
making
him
the
top
recipient
in
the
current
election
cycle
If
the
Democrats
let
the
Republicans
blame
them
for
high
gasoline
prices
they
deserve
to
lose
More
than
75
percent
of
oil
and
gas
industry
contributions
since
1990
have
gone
to
Republicans
totaling
almost
165
million
All
Americans
have
gotten
out
of
the
deal
is
higher
gas
prices
Meanwhile
oil
companies
like
Exxon
Mobile
have
made
record
profits
40.7
billion
last
year
Are
the
American
people
really
going
to
believe
that
the
reason
the
oil
and
gas
industry
is
giving
Republicans
all
this
money
is
so
they
can
lower
gas
prices
Apparently
the
Republicans
think
so
They
are
ramping
up
their
efforts
to
lay
the
blame
right
in
the
lap
of
Democrats
launching
a
new
campaign
on
the
American
Solutions
Web
site
with
the
tagline
Drill
Here
Drill
Now
to
make
their
case
American
Solutions
bills
itself
as
a
non-partisan
527
political
organization
led
by
former
Republican
Speaker
Newt
Gingrich
The
organizations
top
contributor
is
Sheldon
Adelson
the
billionaire
founder
of
Freedom's
Watch
a
conservative
527
organization
that
backs
the
Bush
Administration
position
on
the
war
in
Iraq
and
pays
for
advertising
supporting
Republican
candidates
and
positions
not
to
mention
attacking
Democratic
candidates
The
organization
is
run
by
and
supported
by
former
members
of
the
Bush
administration
If
you
will
believe
American
Solutions
is
non-partisan
you
probably
also
believe
that
oil
companies
want
to
lower
gas
prices
It
is
a
point
of
some
irony
that
I
came
across
the
American
Solutions
drill

while
perusing
the

Post
online
reading
a
1998
article
on
the
celebratory

of
Republicans
for

Back
then
before
its

convicted
of

and
tax
evasion
charges
that
came
to
light
as
part
of
the

the

a

Clinton
The
Happy
Warrior
Fear
and
Loathing
in
Pennsylvania
Dateline
Maui
Once
again
we
are
down
to
dark
rum
and
ice
It
is
nearly
morning
the
rain
is
slamming
into
the
sliding
glass
doors
of
my
ocean
front
suite
and
the
wind
is
bending
the
palms
near
to
snapping
as
whitecaps
scatter
across
the
bay
The
only
things
in
the
water
are
sea
turtles
and
tiger
sharks
so
a
swim
is
out
for
now
Which
is
just
as
well
as
I
have
been
ruminating
on
the
news
that
Mark
Penn
was
shoved
out
from
his
post
last
week
as
chief
mucky
muck
for
the
foundering
Clinton
campaign
Rumor
has
it
that
Penn
with
his
hair
died
black
and
wearing
a
fake
mustache
slipped
out
of
Washington
on
a
chartered
Lear
jet
in
search
of
a
hideout
on
some
small
island
off
the
coast
of
Columbia
Well
he
can
run
but
he
won't
be
able
to
hide
from
Bill
Clinton's
enforcers
who
will
likely
cut
off
his
fingertips
with
pruning
shears
before
they
feed
him
to
the
sharks
He
probably
has
it
coming
Penn
has
gotten
fat
and
rich
by
selling
politics
for
lucre
as
head
of
Burson-Marstellar
for
cigarette
companies
oil
barons
and
foreign
dictators
But
the
Clinton's
could
have
lived
with
that
if
he
could
have
shown
them
how
to
win
Penn's
real
sin
is
that
rather
than
position
Hillary
Clinton
as
a
ground
breaking
history
making
candidate
a
champion
of
women
children
and
working
families
his
advice
was
to
make
her
look
like
in
the
words
of
the
late
Hunter
S
Thompson
that
gutless
ward
heeler
Hubert
Humphrey
in
1972
They
will
break
his
heels
with
small
baseball
bats
for
that
Why
Penn
would
choose
that
ponderous
path
is
a
very
interesting
question
One
school
of
thought
is
that
he
is
a
tone
deaf
sap
that
couldn't
have
gotten
Hillary
elected
to
a
state
water
board
Whatever
the
reason
by
setting
up
Hillary
Clinton
as
the
entitled
establishment
frontrunner
Penn
robbed
her
campaign
of
the
energy
and
excitement
that
she
could
have
generated
by
personalizing
her
quest
to
become
the
first
woman
in
history
to
become
president
The
result
was
to
make
her
look
like
just
another
hack
reinforcing
perceptions
of
her
as
another
dull
overly
ambitious
politician
willing
to
say
or
do
anything
to
get
elected
Why
not
just
put
her
in
a
dumpy
blue
suit
with
a
made
for
TV
tie
and
make
her
look
like
another
boring
fat
white
guy
Frankly
I
have
been
a
little
ambivalent
about
the
Clinton-Obama
battle
I
kind
have
enjoyed
the
show
But
now
I
am
starting
to
worry
because
the
2008
presidential
campaign
is
beginning
to
bear
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
the
1972
presidential
debacle
I
have
been
re-reading
Thompson's
brilliant
Fear
and
Loathing
on
the
Campaign
Trail
72
and
I
am
not
sure
if
we
should
consider
Thompson
as
a
historian
or
visionary
It's
almost
as
if
you
could
cross
out
Humphrey's
name
for
Clinton's
and
McGovern
for
Obama
and
republish
the
book
as
a
narrative
on
the
current
campaign
Bush
of
course
is
Nixon
although
since
he
cannot
run
John
McCain
is
also
a
good
fit
for
that
role
The
similarities
are
more
frightening
than
a
mescaline
flashback
For
those
of
you
to
young
to
know
or
to
old
to
remember
during
the
1972
Democratic
primary
Senator
George
McGovern
came
out
of
nowhere
to
toss
the
establishment
candidates
Edmund
Muskie
and
Hubert
Humphrey
who
were
sorry
for
their
votes
to
support
the
war
in
Vietnam
under
the
train
Running
on
an
anti-war
platform
and
promoting
a
new
politics
that
excited
new
and
younger
voters
McGovern
out
organized
and
out
hustled
the
hacks
to
win
the
nomination
to
at
the
Democratic
National
convention
in
Miami
But
it
was
a
bitter
fight
with
Humphrey
and
Muskie
doing
their
best
to
turn
working
class
blue-collar
voters
against
McGovern
Even
after
McGovern
won
the
nomination
they
refused
to
close
ranks
behind
him
and
thousands
of
Democrats
voted
for
Nixon
in
a
landslide
victory
for
the
soon
to
be
impeached
President
If
that
sounds
familiar
it
should
Holding
Clinton
and
other
Democratic
candidates
to
account
for
their
support
for
the
war
in
Iraq
Obama
has
blended
a
field
operation
right
out
of
McGovern's
campaign
with
cutting
edge
communication
technologies
to
bring
thousands
of
new
voters
to
the
polls
and
raise
millions
of
dollars
in
financial
support
The
Obama
camp
has
out-smarted
and
out-worked
the
Clinton
campaign
to
build
an
insurmountable
delegate
lead
In
a
bitter
and
desperate
attempt
to
overturn
Obama's
edge
among
voters
by
grabbing
the
support
of
super
delegates
Clinton
is
employing
a
scorched
earth
effort
to
turn
blue-collar
voters
in
today's
primary
in
Pennsylvania
against
Obama
in
a
last
minute
bid
for
victory
Mark
Penn
may
have
mismanaged
the
campaign
but
Clinton
cannot
blame
her
metamorphous
into
the
Happy
Warrior
entirely
on
him
Some
would
argue
that
in
the
heat
of
the
campaign
she
is
only
showing
her
true
colors
But
let's
hope
Hillary
Clinton
remembers
how
this
story
turns
out
she
did
after
all
work
for
George
McGovern
The
Humphrey
strategy
did
not
work
in
1972
and
it
will
not
work
for
Clinton
in
2008
It
may
be
too
late
for
her
campaign
but
it's
not
too
late
for
her
to
remember
who
she
is
and
help
the
Democrats
avoid
a
rerun
of
1972

The
Coin
Toss
Solution
When
the
going
gets
weird
the
weird
turn
pro
Hunter
S
Thompson
My
guess
is
that
the
late
Hunter
S
Thompson
would
have
loved
the
current
Democratic
primary
I
mean
when
did
we
ever
have
a
political
race
so
strange
that
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
endorsed
a
black
candidate
for
president
because
as
much
as
they
hate
black
people
they
hate
the
other
candidate
even
more
Thompson
probably
would
have
covered
the
Ohio
primary
from
Klan
headquarters
in
Marion
Ohio
Thompson
loved
the
political
horse
race
once
writing
about
politics
and
journalism
as
worse
for
you
than
heroin
and
twice
as
hard
to
quit
So
as
this
strange
Democratic
primary
with
two
candidates
running
neck
and
neck
seesaws
to
an
unpredictable
and
possibly
explosive
finish
the
RockThrower
blog
is
offering
an
absurd
but
effective
plan
for
resolving
the
battle
between
Hillary
Clinton
and
Barak
Obama
for
the
Democratic
nomination
We're
calling
it
the
Hunter
S
Thompson
Memorial
Coin
Toss
Solution
Thompson
a
lifelong
handicapper
of
politics
surely
would
approve
Here
is
how
it
would
work
Following
the
Pennsylvania
Primary
should
there
be
a
difference
of
less
than
200
delegates
separating
Clinton
and
Obama
in
their
quest
for
the
nomination
the
candidates
would
agree
to
participate
in
a
coin
toss
to
determine
the
outcome
of
the
race
The
winner
of
the
coin
toss
would
be
the
candidate
for
President
the
loser
would
agree
to
serve
as
Vice
President
It
could
be
on
national
TV
Maybe
Al
Gore
could
flip
the
coin
I
know
I
know
its
ridiculous
It's
trivial
It's
absurd
But
it
also
might
be
the
best
way
to
resolve
this
mess
Think
about
it
for
a
minute
First
what
could
be
fairer
a
coin
toss
gives
both
parties
an
equal
chance
to
win
And
its
not
like
we
are
talking
about
a
difference
between
Barak
Obama
and
lets
say
some
Republican
nutcase
like
oh
President
Bush
Obama
and
Clinton
are
very
similar
in
their
approach
to
policy
and
both
are
well
liked
by
Democratic
voters
with
several
polls
showing
that
each
would
be
acceptable
to
the
others
supporters
should
they
win
the
nomination
It
would
also
ensure
that
Clinton
and
Obama
team
up
to
run
against
John
McCain
a
combination
that
many
Democrats
describe
at
their
dream
ticket
The
Coin
Toss
can
also
help
avoid
a
bruising
battle
within
the
Democratic
party
that
may
leave
one
side
feeling
ripped
off
and
result
in
major
voting
blocks
sitting
out
the
election
A
coin
toss
solution
is
not
without
precedent
A
dead
woman
won
re-election
to
a
school
board
in
rural
Alaska
after
her
opponent
lost
a
coin
flip
meant
to
break
an
electoral
tie
In
2006
the
Democratic
Primary
race
for
Congressional
District
37
in
Alaska
between
incumbent
Representative
Carl
Moses
and
challenger
Bryce
Edgmon
was
settled
by
a
coin
toss
And
in
Illinois
citing
state
law
requiring
the
state
election
board
to
break
ties
by
lottery
Judge
Francis
Barth
specifically
ordered
that
the
contest
be
decided
by
lot
in
a
race
for
the
Illinois
state
legislature
And
a
coin
toss
is
considered
legal
under
the
election
laws
of
many
states
Even
in
the
current
presidential
race
a
coin
toss
has
already
been
a
deciding
factor
in
a
state
primary
According
to
the
Austin
American
Statesman
Obama
supporter
Courtney
Enriquez
said
the
Texas
caucus
she
attended
was
split
exactly
between
Clinton
and
Obama
but
the
precinct
had
27
delegates
So
after
consulting
the
campaigns
and
the
Texas
Democratic
Party
caucus
leaders
tossed
a
coin
and
Obama
won
giving
him
14
of
the
precinct's
delegates
to
Clinton's
13
If
it
was
good
enough
for
Obama
in
Texas
it
ought
to
be
good
enough
for
him
in
deciding
the
Democratic
nomination
In
a
normal
election
year
I'd
say
that
a
coin
toss
was
ridiculous
but
this
is
anything
but
a
normal
year
This
is
a
year
so
weird
that
extraordinary
measures
are
required
And
as
Thompson
would
say
when
the
going
gets
weird
the
weird
turn
pro
Support
the
coin
toss
resolution

RockThrower's
Random
thoughts
on
Ohio
Texas
and
other
Primary
Matters
If
you
liked
Bush
your
gonna
love
McCain
If
McCain
wins
it
will
be
four
more
years
of
the
same
old
thing
Geez
if
I
am
going
to
have
to
listen
to
more
speeches
like
that
one
last
night
I
will
have
to
drink
more
a
lot
more
I
think
the
Democratic
Primary
has
been
a
blast
This
is
what
democracy
is
supposed
to
be
about
What's
the
rush
to
pick
a
candidate
Hell
I
can't
even
make
up
my
own
mind
about
who
should
be
the
nominee
I
say
on
to
Pennsylvania
I'm
even
wiling
to
rerun
the
races
in
Florida
and
Michigan
The
Race
between
Barak
and
Hillary
will
dominate
news
coverage
organize
activists
and
generate
enthusiasm
among
voters
All
that
boring
old
white
guy
is
going
to
be
able
to
do
is
talk
about
what
other
boring
sleazy
braindead
Republican
he
is
going
to
pick
as
his
vice
president
Hillary
Clinton
kicked
Barak
Obama's
ass
last
night
in
Ohio
Jerome
Armstrong
of
MyDD
reports
that
Obama
won
a
total
of
5
counties
and
lost
in
82
counties
Even
though
he's
able
to
rack
up
a
large
number
of
urban
black
voters
he
did
terrible
among
white
voters
winning
just
34
percent
Clinton
says
as
Ohio
goes
so
goes
the
nation
Well
she
may
be
right
but
the
reality
is
that
Ohio
is
going
to
hell
in
a
handbasket
Ohio
voters
are
clearly
in
desperate
straights
and
responded
to
Clinton's
economic
message
The
Los
Angeles
Times
reports
that
in
exit
polls
voters
who
were
anxious
about
family
finances
or
the
economy
favored
Clinton
over
Obama
Bill
Clinton
and
Al
Gore
for
Hillary
Apparently
banned
from
any
stage
in
which
his
wife
is
on
Bill
Clinton
looks
a
little
lonely
on
the
campaign
trail
Today
he
is
with
the
cows
in
Wyoming
Maybe
the
Clinton
forces
can
get
Al
Gore
to
join
him
in
the
pick
up
truck
O.K
it
can
be
a
hybrid
pickup
to
keep
him
company
Seriously
about
the
most
important
thing
the
Clinton
team
could
do
right
now
is
to
get
Al
Gore
to
endorse
Hillary
and
hit
the
campaign
trail
The
Coin
Flip
Petition
OK
so
lets
say
that
Clinton
and
Obama
come
out
of
Pennsylvania
with
less
than
100
delegates
separating
them
Rather
than
have
some
big
backroom
battle
that
tears
the
party
apart
I
say
the
candidates
should
agree
to
a
coin
toss
to
decide
the
nomination
The
winner
gets
to
be
president
the
loser
gets
VP
What
could
be
more
fair
Sign

Presidential

RockThrower
Results
II
Clinton
Beats
Obama
in
Texas
and
Ohio
I'll
be
kind
and
just
say
that
the
members
of
the
RockThrower
Index
got
it
wrong
badly
Respondents
said
Obama
would
win
in
Texas
and
Ohio
and
that
Clinton
should
drop
out
My
wife
however
got
it
right
and
she
thinks
Obama
should
drop
out
Congrats
to
Hillary
Clinton
And
kisses
to
my
wife
On
to
Pennsylvania
ps
Bill
Clinton
is
a
genius
He
sets
the
bar
high
saying
she
has
to
win
both
Texas
and
Ohio
and
she
does

Back

There's
nothing
that
cleanses
your
soul
like
getting
the
hell
kicked
out
of

Woody
Hayes
Football
Coach

University
I
really
have
nothing
against
Ohio
It's
just
that
I
find
it
a
little
odd
that
once
again
the
fate
of
the
Democratic
Party
appears
to
be
in
the
hands
of
the
voters
of
the
Buckeye
state
My
guess
is
that
how
Ohio
votes
on
Tuesday
will
go
along
way
toward
determining
just
who
the
Democratic
Presidential
candidate
will
be
Call
me
paranoid
but
that
makes
me
a
little
uneasy
I
mean
this
isn't
exactly
a
state
that
has
made
a
lot
of
good
decisions
lately
Maybe
we
should
just
see
who
they
vote
for
and
then
nominate
the
other
person
It
was
Ohio
you
will
remember
who
re-elected
George
W
Bush
to
a
second
term
Never
mind
that
the
policies
of
the
Bush
administration
were
driving
the
Ohio
economy
into
the
ditch
in
2004
Ohio
voters
came
out
of
the
bushes
to
vote
against
gay
marriage
and
while
they
were
at
it
to
vote
against
John
Kerry
Maybe
they
were
just
seeking
salvation
It
was
after
all
that
Ohio
paragon
Woody
Hayes
who
once
famously
said
There's
nothing
that
cleanses
your
soul
