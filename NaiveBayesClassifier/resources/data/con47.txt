This
poorly
drawn
cartoon
by
Rick
McKee
appeared
in
the
Augusta
Chronicle
eight
days
ago
but
it's
just
making
my
way
around
the
wife's
office
and
it's
still
fairly
amusing
Of
course
had
McCain
followed
my
advice
and
opted
out
of
Federal
funds
he'd
have
more
than
87
million
to
work
with
too

Debit
Cards
Poised
To
Overtake
Credit
Cards
Dodd
Friday
October
31
2008
According
to
Business
Week
money
spent
by
means
of
debit
cards
could
surpass
credit
card
transactions
this
year
as
consumers
seek
to
avoid
the
fees
and
costs
of
credit
not
to
mention
the
increased
difficulty
of
getting
credit
in
the
first
place
This
has
banks
scrambling
to
figure
out
how
to
profit
from
cards
that
don't
pay
interest
and
generally
have
lower
fees
On
the
plus
side
debit
cards
don't
pose
a
threat
to
the
banks
books
like
credit-card
accounts
losses
are
mounting
as
borrowers
fall
behind
on
their
payments
But
the
profits
on
debit
cards
aren't
as
plump
since
banks
don't
collect
interest
on
them
Issuers
largely
make
money
from
fees
which
pale
next
to
those
on
credit
cards
Retailers
for
instance
fork
over
1.6
of
credit
purchases
to
banks
three
times
the
amount
on
debit
transactions
But
don't
shed
a
tear
for
the
banks
just
yet
Time
and
again
they've
shown
an
uncanny
ability
to
adapt
to
a
new
profit
landscape
and
the
debit-card
business
appears
no
different
Consider
the
evolution
of
overdraft
fees
It
used
to
be
that
banks
denied
debit
purchases
when
consumers
didn't
have
enough
money
in
their
accounts
Now
14
of
the
15
largest
banks
approve
transactions
but
hit
customers
with
a
fee
if
they
exceed
the
funds
It's
not
unlike
getting
charged
for
bouncing
a
check
A
recent
study
by
Web
site
Bankrate.com
found
that
overdraft
fees
now
approach
29
up
3
in
the
past
year
Not
that
they
don't
want
the
business
In
fact
they're
actively
promoting
debit
cards
to
both
ends
of
the
income
spectrum
Among
the
groups
that
offer
the
biggest
potential
for
banks
people
who
earn
more
than
75,000
a
year
According
to
MasterCard
they're
the
least
active
debit
users
usually
turning
instead
to
credit
cards
that
offer
frequent-flier
miles
and
other
rewards
To
attract
that
crowd
financial
firms
are
ramping
up
their
loyalty
programs
MasterCard's
Savings
program
launched
in
October
offers
debit
users
discounts
on
luxury
brands
like
Armani
and
7
For
All
Mankind
as
well
as
at
retailers
such
as
Home
Depot
and
Target
San
Antonio's
Frost
Bank
recently
released
its
Momentum
card
which
is
connected
to
customers
checking
or
savings
accounts
The
bank
pays
customers
a
higher
interest
rate
on
the
accounts
up
to
3.5
when
they
make
more
debit
purchases
There's
also
a
land
grab
for
the
so-called
underbanked
the
roughly
80
million
people
who
don't
have
a
bank
or
credit-card
account
Dallas
Comerica
Bank
won
the
right
this
year
to
issue
debit
cards
to
the
estimated
4
million
Social
Security
recipients
who
don't
have
bank
accounts
The
government
deposits
the
money
onto
a
prepaid
card
Comerica
doesn't
charge
overdraft
fees
on
them
Visa
and
MasterCard
offer
prepaid
debit
cards
that
companies
use
to
pay
employees
It
stands
to
reason
that
debit
cards
become
more
popular
in
the
current
environment
That
the
banks
will
find
ways
to
squeeze
more
out
of
them
is
equally
inevitable

The

A
top
general
in
the
Japan
Self-Defense
Force
is
reportedly
facing
discharge
for
remarks
he
made
on
of
all
places
the
web
site
of
a
Japanese
hotel
and
apartment
developer
blaming
Japan's
invasions
of
China
Korea
and
other
neighboring
Asian
countries
on
the
United
States
TOKYO
Reuters
Japan
was
ensnared
into
World
War
Two
by
the
United
States
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
Japanese
air
force
has
written
in
an
essay
denying
the
country
was
ever
the
aggressor
in
China
General
Toshio
Tamogami's
essay
posted
on
the
website
of
a
Japanese
hotel
and
apartment
developer
could
stir
controversy
with
Asian
neighbors
such
as
China
and
South
Korea
where
memories
of
Tokyo's
wartime
acts
and
colonization
run
deep
Spokesmen
for
Japan's
foreign
and
defense
ministries
declined
comment
on
the
air
force
general's
comments
Disputes
over
wartime
history
often
fray
ties
with
Beijing
and
Seoul
although
relations
with
China
especially
have
warmed
in
the
past
two
years
as
both
sides
seek
to
put
priority
on
deepening
trade
and
investment
Even
now
there
are
many
people
who
think
that
our
country's
aggression
caused
unbearable
suffering
to
the
countries
of
Asia
during
the
Greater
East
Asia
War
But
we
need
to
realize
that
many
Asian
countries
take
a
positive
view
of
the
Greater
East
Asia
War
Tamogami
wrote
in
the
essay
It
is
certainly
a
false
accusation
to
say
that
our
country
was
an
aggressor
nation
Don't
bother
going
to
the
URL
for
the
essay
in
the
article
it's
a
bum
one
I
located
the
web
site
but
my
Japanese
isn't
good
enough
for
me
to
locate
the
essay
itself
if
it's
still
posted
I
wouldn't
doubt
that
there's
a
kernel
of
truth
in
the
general's
comments
but
the
notion
that
Japan
didn't
invade
its
neighbors
or
that
the
invasions
were
in
some
way
necessary
for
Japan's
self-defense
are
far-fetched
to
say
the
least
Still
I
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
the
general's
comments
don't
represent
a
view
that's
common
in
Japan
The
Japanese
have
understandably
downplayed
their
actions
during
World
War
II
for
more
than
60
years
After
all
it's
a
shameful
episode
for
them
That's
something
I
think
it's
important
for
us
to
remember
while
World
War
II
may
be
an
object
of
pride
for
the
Yanks
and
Brits
for
practically
everybody
else
it's
an
unbearably
painful
memory
and
frequently
a
shameful
one

Persuadable
James

Friday

A
new
poll
claims
that
a
whopping
14
percent
of
likely
voters
think
they
may
still
change
their
minds
in
the
five
days
remaining
before
the
election
One
in
seven
or
14
percent
can't
decide
or
back
a
candidate
but
might
switch
according
to
an
Associated
Press-Yahoo
News
poll
of
likely
voters
released
Friday
Who
are
they
They
look
a
lot
like
the
voters
who've
already
locked
onto
a
candidate
though
they're
more
likely
to
be
white
and
less
likely
to
be
liberal
And
they
disproportionately
backed
Hillary
Rodham
Clinton's
failed
run
for
the
Democratic
nomination
For
now
their
indecision
remains
intact
despite
the
fortunes
that
have
been
spent
to
tug
people
toward
either
McCain
the
Republican
or
the
Democrat
Obama
Fueling
their
uncertainty
is
a
combination
of
disliking
something
about
both
candidates
and
frustration
with
this
campaign
and
politics
in
general
Ordinarily
I
use
the
term
undecided
voter
interchangably
with
idiots
and
non-voters
In
most
races
even
when
there's
not
a
candidate
I'm
excited
about
it's
simply
astounding
to
me
that
someone
couldn't
decide
given
the
stark
differences
between
the
Republican
and
Democratic
candidates
Not
so
much
this
year
Even
our
own
Dave
Schuler
was
still
as
of
Wednesday
evening's
edition
of
OTB
Radio
not
firmly
decided
although
he's
leaning
ever-so-slightly
towards
Obama
Many
people
who
normally
vote
Democrat
are
truly
worried
about
Obama's
seasoning
Many
people
who
normally
vote
Republican
are
concerned
about
McCain's
temperament
and
the
risk
of
Sarah
Palin
ascending
to
the
presidency
Moderates
seem
to
prefer
McCain
on
foreign
policy
but
would
rather
have
Obama
calling
the
shots
on
the
economy
and
health
care
Obama
has
to
deal
with
the
Clinton
dead-enders
the
so-called
PUMAs
and
McCain
has
to
fire
up
conservatives
who
don't
trust
him
That
said
I
simply
don't
believe
the
numbers
here
My
strong
hunch
is
that
the
overwhelming
preponderance
of
self-identified
persuadables
are
either
trying
to
appear
open-minded
or
are
simply
reluctant
partisans
The
real
number
is
likely
somewhere
around
the
6.5
percent
currently
unaccounted
for
in
the
RealClearPolitics
average
These
people
will
I
believe
break
disproportionately
perhaps
2-to-1
or
even
3-to-1
for
John
McCain
After
all
they're
overwhelmingly
people
who
voted
for
George
W
Bush
the
last
two
cycles
and
who
haven't
yet
jumped
on
the
Obama
bandwagon
Given
that
Obama's
within
a
rounding
error
of
50
percent
both
nationally
and
in
enough
of
the
states
Bush
won
in
2000
and
2004
to
win
in
the
Electoral
College
however
I
don't
think
it'll
be
enough

A
NYT/CBS
poll
shows
that
a
strong
majority
of
voters
believe
Sarah
Palin
is
unqualified
for
the
vice
presidency
and
a
third
saying
this
would
affect
their
vote
Gov
Sarah
Palin
campaigning
Thursday
in
Cape
Girardeau
Mo
as
poll
numbers
flagged
Whitney
Curtis/Getty
Images
All
told
59
percent
of
voters
surveyed
said
Ms
Palin
was
not
prepared
for
the
job
up
nine
percentage
points
since
the
beginning
of
the
month
Nearly
a
third
of
voters
polled
said
the
vice-presidential
selection
would
be
a
major
factor
influencing
their
vote
for
president
and
those
voters
broadly
favor
Senator
Barack
Obama
the
Democratic
nominee
And
in
a
possible
indication
that
the
choice
of
Ms
Palin
has
hurt
Mr
McCain's
image
voters
said
they
had
much
more
confidence
in
Mr
Obama
to
pick
qualified
people
for
his
administration
than
they
did
in
Mr
McCain
The
increase
in
the
number
of
voters
who
said
Ms
Palin
was
not
prepared
was
driven
almost
entirely
by
Republicans
and
independents
Over
all
views
of
Ms
Palin
were
apparently
shaped
more
by
ideology
and
party
than
by
gender
Ms
Palin
was
viewed
as
unprepared
for
the
job
by
about
6
in
10
men
and
women
alike
But
8
in
10
Democrats
viewed
her
as
unprepared
as
well
as
more
than
6
in
10
independents
and
3
in
10
Republicans
The
bold
highlighted
text
is
key
here
A
third
of
self-identified
Republicans
and
two-thirds
of
independents
think
Palin
unprepared
The
former
includes
the
likes
of
former
Secretary
of
State
Larry
Eagleburger
who
said
in
an
NPR
appearance
yesterday
in
which
he
was
making
the
case
for
a
McCain
presidency
that
of
course
she's
not
ready
Asked
by
the
host
whether
Palin
could
step
in
during
a
time
of
crisis
Eagleburger
reverted
to
sarcasm
before
leveling
the
harsh
blow
It
is
a
very
good
question
he
said
pausing
a
few
seconds
then
adding
with
a
chuckle
I'm
being
facetious
here
Look
of
course
not
Eagleburger
explained
I
don't
think
at
the
moment
she
is
prepared
to
take
over
the
reigns
of
the
presidency
I
can
name
for
you
any
number
of
other
vice
presidents
who
were
not
particularly
up
to
it
either
So
the
question
I
think
is
can
she
learn
and
would
she
be
tough
enough
under
the
circumstances
if
she
were
asked
to
become
president
heaven
forbid
that
that
ever
takes
place
Give
her
some
time
in
the
office
and
I
think
the
answer
would
be
she
will
be
pause
adequate
I
can't
say
that
she
would
be
a
genius
in
the
job
But
I
think
she
would
be
enough
to
get
us
through
a
four
year
well
I
hope
not
get
us
through
whatever
period
of
time
was
necessary
And
I
devoutly
hope
that
it
would
never
be
tested
Looking
at
the
polls
I'm
pretty
sure
she
won't
The
conventional
wisdom
has
long
been
that
people
don't
vote
based
on
the
VP
pick
it
would
be
odd
indeed
if
the
trend
were
broken
in
the
wrong
direction
Then
again
given
the
economic
meltdown
Bush's
popularity
and
Obama's
money
it
may
well
have
been
that
McCain
could
have
chosen
a
candidate
who
combined
all
the
virtues
of
Ronald
Reagan
Abe
Lincoln
and
George
Washington
and
not
pulled
it
off

Economic
Growth
Goes
Negative
Updated
Steve
Verdon
Thursday
October
30
2008
The
Bureau
of
Economic
Analysis
is
reporting
that
the
U.S
economy
grew
at
a
0.3
annual
rate
in
the
third
quarter
Real
gross
domestic
product
the
output
of
goods
and
services
produced
by
labor
and
property
located
in
the
United
States
decreased
at
an
annual
rate
of
0.3
percent
in
the
third
quarter
of
2008
that
is
from
the
second
quarter
to
the
third
quarter
according
to
advance
estimates
released
by
the
Bureau
of
Economic
Analysis
In
the
second
quarter
real
GDP
increased
2.8
percent
Not
that
surprising
with
all
that
is
going
on
What
is
driving
the
reduction
in
GDP
Reductions
in
personal
consumption
expenditures
The
decrease
in
real
GDP
in
the
third
quarter
primarily
reflected
negative
contributions
from
personal
consumption
expenditures
PCE
residential
fixed
investment
and
equipment
and
software
that
were
largely
offset
by
positive
contributions
from
federal
government
spending
exports
private
inventory
investment
nonresidential
structures
and
state
and
local
government
spending
Imports
which
are
a
subtraction
in
the
calculation
of
GDP
decreased
Personal
Consumption
Expenditures
PCE
is
the
largest
component
of
GDP
coming
in
at
about
70.6
of
GDP
So
when
consumers
decide
to
stop
spending
money
or
at
least
spend
less
it
can
be
a
problem
in
terms
of
economic
growth
This
article
points
to
a
less
than
stellar
outlook
for
the
labor
markets
as
well
Separately
the
Labor
Department
said
weekly
claims
for
new
unemployment
benefits
were
unchanged
at
a
lofty
479,000
last
week
a
level
that
signals
weak
hiring
prospects
The
U.S
economy
has
shed
jobs
in
each
of
the
last
nine
months
with
about
750,000
lost
so
far
On
Thursday
American
Express
said
it
would
cut
7,000
jobs
while
Motorola
Inc
said
it
would
let
3,000
workers
go
Mass
layoffs
involving
50
or
more
people
hit
their
highest
level
since
September
2001
last
month
I
think
it
is
fair
to
say
it
will
likely
get
worse
before
it
gets
better
Update
Forgot
to
add
these
are
advanced
estimates
and
are
subject
to
revision
over
the
coming
months
It
could
turn
out
that
growth
will
end
up
positive
but
equally
low
It
is
unlikley
however
that
growth
will
be
comparable
to
the
second
quarters
2.8
annual
rate
UPDATE
Dave
Schuler
To
place
this
degree
of
contraction
in
a
little
perspective
here's
a
chart
of
year-to-year
GDP
change
from
roughly
1930
to
2005
Way
over
there
at
the
left
are
the
early
years
of
the
Great
Depression
of
the
1930's
during
which
the
year-to-year
contraction
of
the
economy
was
in
the
vicinity
of
6
to
12
per
year
or
20
to
40
times
the
annualized
decrease
of
which
Steve
appropriately
takes
note
I
don't
mean
by
this
to
disregard
that
some
people
have
lost
their
jobs
or
deny
that
the
economy
has
indeed
contracted
I'd
just
like
to
stave
off
the
comparisons
to
the
1930's
a
bit
Update
Steve
Verdon
Quite
agree
with
Dave's
point
This
is
not
1930
The
economy
is
taking
a
beating
but
anyone
trying
to
argue
we
are
heading
into
a
depression
at
this
juncture
either
has
a
really
nice
crystal
ball
or
is
being
foolhardy

Over
at
New
Atlanticist
I
argue
in
American
Elections
and
UK
Relations
against
the
notion
that
Americans
or
Europeans
should
expect
much
to
change
in
our
international
relationship
simply
because
there
will
soon
be
a
new
occupant
in
the
White
House
Instead
as
always
events
and
the
perceived
interests
of
the
actors
involved
will
dictate
the
outcome
In
Don't
Know
Much
About
Foreign
Policy
I
address
Cernig's
concern
that
Americans
are
largely
uninterested
in
world
affairs
with
a
Seinfeldian
not
that
there's
anything
wrong
with
that

Early
Voting
Breakdowns
Good
For
Obama
Alex
Knapp
Thursday
October
30
2008
Marc
Ambinder
breaks
down
the
early
voting
numbers
and
things
aren't
looking
good
for
McCain
Gallup
and
Pew
data
show
that
Democrats
are
leading
in
the
early
vote
The
equally
reliable
Annenberg
National
Election
Survey's
data
shows
that
across
the
country
Democrats
are
tied
with
Republicans
in
the
early
vote
Obviously
early
voting
matters
by
state
only
but
these
datums
are
worth
noting
because
Republicans
have
historically
held
an
early
vote
advantage
nationwide
Note
Republicans
tend
to
get
their
folks
to
fill
out
absentee
ballots
and
return
them
early
Dems
are
investing
disproportionately
in
getting
people
to
leave
their
homes
and
vote
early
so
Democratic
numbers
will
increase
as
the
election
approaches
In
battleground
states
Obama
is
leading
in
Florida
2.5
million
people
Democrats
have
a
6
advantage
on
ballots
turned
in
up
slightly
in
Colorado
note
that
the
early
vote
is
already
approaching
50
of
the
2004
total
leading
in
Nevada
overperforming
in
North
Carolina
where
Dems
have
historically
had
a
good
program
and
a
few
points
behind
in
Georgia
35.5
of
the
early
voters
there
are
black
Ambinder
also
notes
that
this
is
the
reverse
of
the
2004
trends
which
should
a
larger
Republican
lead
A
note
about
Colorado
an
internal
Republican
spreadsheet
suggests
that
Democrats
have
returned
34.6
of
their
ballots
as
of
Tuesday
and
Republicans
have
returned
32.9
of
their
ballots
for
about
a
15,000
vote
advantage
In
2004
at
about
this
time
Republicans
had
n
advantage
and
won
the
early
vote
by
about
eight
points
1.6
million
people
requested
mail-in
ballots
that's
triple
the
2004
number
and
Obama
has
a
two
to
one
advantage
with
low
turnout
voters
who've
already
turned
in
their
ballots
Read
the
whole
post
which
has
lots
more
data
as
well
as
links
to
the
direct
sources
The
bottom
line
here
is
that
more
people
are
voting
early
this
year
and
the
majority
of
people
voting
early
are
Democrats
This
speaks
not
only
to
the
enthusiasm
gap
that
McCain
has
been
suffering
under
for
this
election
cycle
but
also
to
the
Obama
campaign's
GOTV
efforts
and
ground
game
It's
important
to
realize
that
the
Obama
campaign
hasn't
just
been
channeling
it's
fundraising
efforts
into
more
advertising
it's
been
channeling
a
lot
of
effort
to
its
volunteers
and
voter
information
campaigns
Heck
just
look
at
this
Yes
that's
the
Obama
campaign
organizing
volunteers
in
one
state
to
go
help
with
get
out
the
vote
efforts
in
battleground
states
The
Obama
campaign
pays
for
hotel
and
meal
expenses
That's
the
ground
game
that
the
McCain
campaign
finds
himself
up
against
I
checked
the
McCain
website
and
found
no
similar
program
Frankly
given
the
limitations
of
federal
funding
I
doubt
that
McCain
would
have
the
resources
to
devote
much
to
such
a
program
anyway
Especially
when
he
has
been
diverting
resources
to
states
that
should
be
safe
like
Montana
and
Arizona

Building
a
Rightroots
Movement
James
Joyner
Thursday
October
30
2008
Patrick
Ruffini
takes
up
where
Jon
Henke
and
John
Hawkins
leave
off
offering
a
lament
that
conservative
bloggers
don't
engage
in
activism
to
the
extent
that
their
lefty
counterparts
do
thus
leading
to
the
demise
of
Western
Civilization
as
we
know
it
Righty
Pundits
vs
Lefty
Activists
Ruffini
thinks
the
rightosphere
is
mired
in
2003
and
are
too
shy
or
aloof
to
use
their
blogs
to
raise
money
for
Republicans
content
instead
to
be
mere
pundits
Almost
without
exception
conservative
bloggers
are
hobbyists
and
those
that
aren't
are
usually
employed
by
old
line
conservative
media
A
lack
of
politically
sophisticated
full-time
bloggers
as
well
as
dependence
on
existing
center-right
institutions
is
holding
the
rightroots
back
from
becoming
a
full-fledged
counterpart
to
the
netroots
one
that
is
not
beholden
to
the
Republican
Party
or
the
offline
conservative
movement
Speaking
only
for
myself
and
thus
becoming
part
of
the
problem
I'm
not
in
this
to
raise
money
for
political
candidates
let
alone
rally
the
base
Blogging
is
an
outlet
for
conversation
Regular
readers
know
my
partisan
inclinations
but
drive-by
readers
often
guess
wrong
Constitutionally
I'm
just
not
geared
for
flackery
or
hackery
Hewing
to
the
party
line
in
order
to
advance
The
Cause
comes
at
too
high
a
price
I'm
afraid
A
Soros
for
the
Right
He's
intrigued
by
Hawkins
idea
of
finding
a
conservative
sugar
daddy
to
finance
would-be
activist
hacks
On
the
other
hand
you
could
have
one
conservative
donor
with
deep
pockets
who
could
hand
out
let's
say
twenty
25,000
grants
for
two
years
in
a
row
and
they
could
double
the
size
the
blogosphere
How
Well
there
are
a
number
of
bloggers
who
could
go
full
time
if
they
could
add
25,000
a
year
to
the
money
they're
making
off
of
advertising
There
are
other
bloggers
who
could
use
that
money
to
advertise
their
blogs
Some
other
people
could
use
the
money
to
recruit
talent
and
do
reporting
Given
that
the
traffic
in
the
blogosphere
tends
to
be
heavily
concentrated
in
the
top
blogs
of
which
there
are
a
relatively
small
number
you
could
see
the
size
of
those
blogs
dramatically
increase
with
these
grants
This
strikes
me
as
rather
problematic
For
one
thing
without
conducting
a
formal
census
I'm
pretty
sure
there
are
more
than
twenty
existing
blogs
So
adding
another
twenty
would
not
double
the
size
the
blogosphere
Even
if
the
25k
was
only
a
one-time
deal
adding
another
forty
wouldn't
do
it
either
More
importantly
what
is
it
that
we'd
be
getting
for
this
money
A
gang
of
people
who
couldn't
attract
enough
of
an
audience
with
their
blogs
to
make
a
go
of
it
before
getting
an
infusion
are
suddenly
going
to
be
the
next
Daily
Kos
For
12
an
hour
no
less
Oddly
the
actual
Daily
Kos
a
Lefty
Democrat
with
no
ideological
qualms
about
subsidies
managed
to
make
a
go
of
it
through
sheer
entrepreneurial
zeal
Something
doesn't
smell
right
here
Do
We
Really
Need
a
Rightroots
Beyond
that
I
simply
reject
the
premise
of
this
Movement
to
Create
a
Movement
not
to
be
confused
with
Hank
Williams
Jr.'s
failed
effort
to
create
a
Coalition
to
Ban
Coalitions
First
I
would
submit
that
there
are
a
plethora
of
activist
blogs
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
blogosphere
Red
State
TownHall
The
Next
Right
Right
Wing
News
and
others
already
banging
the
drum
and
rattling
the
can
Second
it's
far
from
clear
to
me
that
it
much
matters
Yes
the
Netroots
are
way
ahead
of
us
in
organizing
They
got
first
mover
advantage
because
1
they
were
galvanized
by
coming
out
on
the
wrong
end
of
the
2000
election
brouhaha
and
then
the
Iraq
War
and
2
they're
younger
and
thus
more
attuned
to
the
latest
technology
But
Republicans
are
quickly
catching
up
simply
copying
what's
worked
for
their
opponents
and
innovating
on
their
own
Sure
it
looks
like
our
side's
down
at
the
moment
The
2006
midterms
were
a
bloodbath
and
it's
looking
like
we'll
go
back-to-back
come
Tuesday
Might
I
suggest
that
this
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
comparative
organization
of
the
two
sides
online
but
rather
the
poor
job
Republican
politicians
did
when
given
the
chance
Yes
Barack
Obama
raised
a
truckload
of
money
partly
through
superb
organization
online
Then
again
so
did
Ron
Paul
Frankly
John
McCain
would
have
too
had
he
heeded
my
advice
and
opted
out
of
federal
funds
for
the
general
election
campaign
In
any
case
it's
the
candidates
not
their
blogging
entourage
that
mostly
matters
