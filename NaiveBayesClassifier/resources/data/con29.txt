More
Democrats
for
McCain
Can't
say
whether
this
report
is
true
or
not
but
it
feels
right
Tonight
we
spoke
with
a
friend
from
Hillary
Clinton's
campaign
who
is
now
working
for
McCain/Palin
and
is
specifically
working
with
Democrats
for
McCain
in
Pennsylvania
We
worked
with
her
in
Texas
Indiana
Ohio
and
Pennsylvania
for
Hillary
and
have
spent
many
LONG
hours
with
her
in
the
trenches
in
all
of
those
states
She's
smart
doesn't
BS
and
never
lies
She
says
the
same
thing
we
do
John
McCain
will
win
Pennsylvania
On
November
4th
the
news
networks
are
going
to
be
spinning
and
sputtering
and
playing
catchup
but
everything
we
see
on
the
ground
in
PA
is
what
we
saw
during
the
primaries
Obama
has
no
shot
of
winning
the
Keystone
State
Here
is
specifically
what
we
talked
about
tonight
never
in
any
of
our
careers
have
any
of
us
ever
seen
members
of
one
party
switching
sides
and
voting
for
the
other
party
as
we
see
in
this
election
with
Democrats
for
McCain
There
has
never
been
anything
like
it
Not
even
the
Reagan
Democrats
who
voted
for
Reagan
over
Carter
for
the
simple
fact
that
these
Reagan
Democrats
weren't
identified
and
labeled
until
AFTER
the
election
No
Democrats
for
McCain
are
real
are
voting
for
McCain
right
now
and
are
open
and
organized
as
well
as
self-identifying
Lynn
Rothschild
might
be
our
poster
gal
as
one
of
the
most
prominent
of
our
ranks
but
it's
telling
that
everyone
from
Team
Hillary
that
we
know
now
works
for
McCain
ALL
OF
US
Whether
they
are
open
about
it
like
we
are
or
are
working
quietly
behind
the
scenes
we
can't
think
of
a
single
person
we
worked
with
on
a
daily
basis
for
Hillary
who
is
now
working
on
behalf
of
Obama
We
all
truly
believe
that
John
McCain
will
work
more
closely
with
Hillary
Clinton
in
the
Senate
and
make
it
a
priority
to
team
up
with
her
on
legislation
than
Obama
ever
would
We
also
believe
Obama
winning
this
election
means
his
supporters
would
actively
seek
to
eliminate
all
Clinton
loyalists
from
the
Democratic
Party
to
consolidate
his
power
base
and
purge
anyone
who
is
not
100
loyal
to
him
For
obvious
reasons
those
of
us
loyal
to
the
Clintons
will
not
let
that
happen
without
a
fight
But
this
is
all
talking
about
leadership
and
those
of
us
who
have
invested
two
years
of
our
lives
in
all
of
this
and
have
in
all
honesty
spent
every
cent
we
had
on
this
campaign
What
about
the
regular
voters
Union
members
repeatedly
tell
all
of
us
that
they
are
lying
to
pollsters
because
the
unions
have
been
polling
these
people
and
the
unions
will
threaten
people's
jobs
if
they
don't
tow
the
union
line
So
the
people
lie
when
asked
whom
they
are
supporting
But
the
unions
can't
control
who
they
vote
for
on
Election
Day
And
that's
when
things
are
going
to
get
interesting
We
do
not
believe
Obama
will
carry
Pittsburgh
or
Harrisburg
in
PA
He'll
win
Philly
but
not
by
the
large
margin
he
needs
to
take
the
state
You've
heard
Governor
Ed
Rendell
is
worried
about
Obama's
chances
in
Pennsylvania
That
is
an
understatement
Obama
will
lose
a
state
that
hasn't
gone
red
in
generations
What's
happening
here
that's
not
being
reported
is
that
Reagan
Democrats
who
vote
Republican
whenever
they
feel
that
Democrats
are
out
of
touch
socialist
or
too
liberal
are
voting
for
McCain…and
these
people
are
being
joined
by
PUMAs
DeMcCrats
for
McCain
Hillocrats
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
who
don't
like
or
trust
Obama
and
who
believe
McCain/Palin
would
address
the
wants
and
needs
of
centrist
Democrats
much
better
than
Obama
ever
would
We
personally
believe
this
here
at
HillBuzz
That's
why
we
are
doing
this
We
do
not
believe
Obama
will
put
the
best
interests
of
Americans
first
instead
Obama
will
do
what
is
best
for
Obama
the
way
he
has
always
done
We
do
not
trust
this
man
or
his
socialist
Kool-Aid
and
want
no
part
of
him
In
Pennsylvania
we
are
not
alone
The
same
people
who
ran
the
board
for
us
in
the
primary
who
assured
us
daily
that
the
polls
the
media
was
pushing
were
wrong
in
claiming
Obama
would
beat
Clinton
in
PA
tell
us
on
a
daily
basis
that
McCain
is
going
to
win
Pennsylvania
There's
a
damn
good
chance
this
won't
even
be
close
if
what
people
are
seeing
on
the
ground
right
now
holds
and
is
indicative
of
the
whole
state
DEMOCRATS
are
staffing
McCain
offices
across
the
state
DEMOCRATS
are
phone
banking
and
canvassing
for
McCain
DEMOCRATS
are
raising
large
sums
to
fund
this
last
week
of
campaigning
DEMOCRATS
This
has
NEVER
happened
before
and
the
media
is
ignoring
it
The
media
consistently
claims
that
Obama
enjoys
the
support
of
85
of
Democrats
versus
only
80
of
Republicans
who
supposedly
are
supporting
McCain
We
call
BS
on
all
of
this
we'd
say
90
of
Republicans
are
supporting
McCain
and
65-70
of
Democrats
are
actually
supporting
Obama
At
least
that's
the
case
in
Pennsylvania
and
in
Ohio
too
Our
mission
this
next
week
is
to
reach
out
to
every
Democrat
we
can
and
let
them
know
it's
okay
to
vote
Republican
this
year
because
the
Republican
is
the
better
choice
There
are
two
things
Hillary
Clinton
and
John
McCain
have
in
common
that
we're
thinking
about
right
now
1
both
love
America
more
than
anything
and
truly
want
what's
best
for
the
country
and
not
themselves
and
2
Clinton
has
a
framed
photo
of
McCain
in
her
office
while
McCain
has
a
similar
photo
of
Clinton
in
his
Clinton
and
McCain
are
friends
for
a
reason
and
we
know
they
will
work
well
together
these
next
four
years
We're
going
to
face
some
tough
challenges
in
McCain's
administration
and
we
sincerely
do
pledge
to
all
Republicans
reading
this
that
the
bipartisan
spirit
we've
fostered
during
this
campaign
working
together
with
Republicans
to
elect
McCain
will
continue
in
these
next
4
years
because
America
needs
us
working
together
We
are
all
Americans
right
now
working
together
to
stop
a
socialist
from
becoming
president
and
taking
all
of
us
down
a
very
dangerous
path
Hillary's
Army
is
strong
and
mobilized
and
is
working
its
hard
out
for
McCain/Palin
If
you
Republicans
can
match
our
enthusiasm
and
dedication
we
will
win
this
and
not
just
in
Ohio
and
Pennsylvania
but
all
across
the
country
We
have
the
potential
to
make
this
a
crippling
loss
not
just
for
Obama
but
for
the
far-left
liberal
wing
of
the
Democratic
party
and
the
liberal
elite
media
itself
We
have
the
potential
to
wipe
all
of
these
kooks
and
loons
off
the
political
landscape
with
a
loud
resounding
loss
for
all
of
them
on
November
4th
What
we
have
learned
about
the
state
of
Pennsylvania
tells
us
our
continued
efforts
are
paying
off
and
that
we
just
need
to
stay
focused
and
keep
working
hard
the
next
7
days
to
win
this
for
McCain/Palin
and
in
all
honesty
win
this
for
AMERICA
too
It's
an
honor
to
be
in
this
fight
with
all
of
you
if
we
work
hard
we
will
indeed
win

Redistribution
Comments
Gone
Viral
The
Obama
audio
comments
about
redistributing
wealth
from
a
2001
Chicago
Public
Radio
program
have
gone
viral
Posted
on
YouTube
on
Sunday
in
less
than
48
hours
it
has
received
over
1.7
million
views
and
garnered
over
17,000

UPDATE
Now
over
2
million

and
25,000
comments
It
was
the
most-viewed
video
on
YouTube
yesterday
by
far
and
8
for
the
week
Dick
Morris
just
said
on
Hannity

he's
hemorrhaging

over

As
lefties
are
suggesting
idiotic
interpretations
and
even
some
on
the
right
are
getting
it
wrong
here's
what
he's
saying
1
The
Supreme
Court
never
considered
redistribution
of
wealth
or
economic
justice
among
the
guarantees
provided
to
citizens
2
Even
the
Warren
Court
was
not
radical
enough
to
do
so
to
impose
real
redistributive
change
on
the
nation
3
The
courts
have
generally
provided
negative
constraints
on
the
government
rather
than
positive
obligations
the
government
owes
to
its
citizens
specifically
here
such
as
economic
justice
and
redistribution
of
wealth
4
Therefore
it
is
a
tragedy
that
the
civil
rights
movement
became
so
courts-focused
because
it
limited
what
redress
they
could
actually
obtain
and
it
took
attention
away
from
the
community
organizing
efforts
which
could
assemble
coalitions
of
power
political
power
that
is
to
actually
achieve
redistributive
change
Such
change
simply
could
not
be
had
in
the
courts
still
laboring
under
the
constraints
imposed
by
the
Founding
Fathers
5
And
in
some
ways
we
still
suffer
from
that
And
do
note
that
Obama
is
currently
on
the
brink
of
achieving
the
ultimate
community
organizing
position
the
ultimate
assembler
of
coalitions
of
power
and
the
current
top
legislative
position
and
yes
the
President
is
the
most
important
legislator
in
the
country
through
proposing/advocating
legislation
and
signing
it
into
law
that
will
allow
him
to
pursue
the
redistributive
change
the
Warren
Court
was
tragically
insufficiently
radical
to
contemplate

Obama's
SS
Here
is
Obama
calling
for
a
Civilian
National
Security
Force
as
a
parallel
army
just
as
well
funded
and
just
as
powerful
as
our
current
military
Because
we
cannot
continue
to
rely
only
on
our
military
to
achieve
his
goals
Obama
needs
a
more
reliable
and
pliant
National
Security
Force
Did
he
just
suggest
that
What
in
the
world
would
somebody
need
a
whole
new
parallel
National
Security
Force
for
What
could
possibly
be
its
purpose
This
is
exactly
what
Hitler
did
in
creating
the
SS
as
it
would
be
more
loyal
than
the
regular
army
This
is
patently
insane
UPDATE
This
clip
is
from
a
July
2
2008
speech
Apparently
Obama
deviated
from
his
prepared
remarks
to
deliver
these
lines
Bloggers
but
not
the
MSM
picked
it
up
at
the
time
affirming
that
it
needed
further
explanation

apologists

Obama's
Evil
Communist
Tactics
Report
your
parents
for
ThoughtCrimes
kids
Use
emotional
blackmail
These
are
the
tactics
described
at
Obama
Campaign
Headquarters
for
kids
to
use
which
cross
the
line
into
sheer
evil
The
one
thing
most

have

is
that
they
have
the
most
wonderful
grandchildren
in
the
world
so
clever
so

so
pretty
ever
so
precious
Even
if

are

even
if
your
parents
and
friends
occasionally
wonder
about
you
your
grandma
and
grandpa
love
you
and
have
faith
in
you
That
is
your
weapon
Precious
needs
to
get
on
the
phone
and
say
Grandpa
Grandma
I
am
asking
you
to
vote
for
Barack
Obama
This
is
really
important
to
me
It's
about
my

It's
about
the
world
I
will

in
It's
about
the
world
I
want
for
my
future
children
They
will
love
that
one
Please
Do
it
for
me
The
really
great
part
of
this
strategy
is
that
everything
you
could
possibly
say
to
your
grandparents
about
how
important
Barack's
election
is
for
you
is
one
hundred
percent
true
When
it
comes
to
your
family
you
are
Barack's
most
effective
advocate
There
are
less
than
two
weeks
left
in
this
election
If
you
haven't
already
talked
to
your

now
is
the
time
If

at

let

how
it
went
and
what
advice
you

offer
fellow
supporters
who
are
thinking
about
having
the
talk
themselves.Using
children
as
emotional
political
weapons
against
their
parents
and
grandparents
And
then
REPORT
BACK
on
how
your
parents
will
vote
No
this
isn't
a
different
kind
of
politics
This
is
old-school
communism
This
is
how
the
Maoist
Cultural
Revolution
started
One
great
irony
of
the
Socialist
Education
Movement
is
that
it
called
for
grassroots
action
yet
was
directed
by
Mao
himself
This
movement
aimed
primarily
at
schoolchildren
did
not
have
any
immediate
effect
on

politics
but
it
did
influence
a
generation
of

a

Obama
2001
Bombshell
on
Redistributing
Wealth
Here
is
a
shocking
audio
interview
with
Barack
Obama
from
2001
on
WBEZ-FM
Chicago
Public
Radio
in
which
Obama
laments
that
in
spite
of
the
progress
of
the
Civil
Rights
Movement
the
Supreme
Court
never
ventured
into
the
issues
of
redistribution
of
wealth
and
sort
of
more
basic
issues
of
political
and
economic
justice
in
this
society.He
goes
on
to
state
the
Warren
Court
was
not
radical
enough
in
that
it
adhered
to
the
notion
of
the
Constitution
restricting
government
power
instead
of
decreeing
what
government
must
provide
to
you
He
also
says
one
of
the
tragedies
of
the
Civil
Rights
Movement
was
it
was
too
court-focused
and
did
not
succeed
in
creating
the
coalitions
of
power
to
legislatively
seek
what
he
then
calls
twice
redistributive...change
But
he
doesn't
think
it's
too
late
to
make
the
administrative
changes
to
do
so
legislatively
He
also
says
Any
three
of
us
sitting
here
could
come
up
with
a
rationale
for
bringing
about
economic
change
through
the
courts.Is
is
clear
Obama
is
a
radical
Marxist
His
policies
will
ruin
us
all
When
he
calls
for
Change
I'm
sure
many
of
his
duped
supporters
don't
realize
he
means
Redistributive
Change
As
in
taking
your
money
UPDATE

MODERATOR
Good
morning
and
welcome
to
Odyssey
on
WBEZ
Chicago
91.5
FM
and
we're
joined
by
Barack
Obama
who
is
Illinois
State
Senator
from
the
13th
district
and
senior
lecturer
in
the
law
school
at
the
University
of
Chicago
OBAMA
If
you
look
at
the
victories
and
failures
of
the
civil
rights
movement
and
its
litigation
strategy
in
the
court
I
think
where
it
succeeded
was
to
vest
formal
rights
in
previously
dispossessed
peoples
So
that
I
would
now
have
the
right
to
vote
I
would
now
be
able
to
sit
at
the
lunch
counter
and
order
and
as
long
as
I
could
pay
for
it
I'd
be
okay
But
the
Supreme
Court
never
ventured
into
the
issues
of
redistribution
of
wealth
and
sort
of
more
basic
issues
of
political
and
economic
justice
in
this
society
And
to
that
extent
as
radical
as
people
tried
to
characterize
the
Warren
court
it
wasn't
that
radical
It
didn't
break
free
from
the
essential
constraints
that
were
placed
by
the
founding
fathers
in
the
Constitution
at
least
as
it's
been
interpreted
and
the
Warren
court
interpreted
it
in
the
same
way
that
generally
the
Constitution
is
a
charter
of
negative
liberties
It
says
what
the
states
can't
do
to
you
it
says
what
the
federal
government
can't
do
to
you
but
it
doesn't
say
what
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government
must
do
on
your
behalf
And
that
hasn't
shifted
One
of
the
I
think
tragedies
of
the
civil
rights
movement
was
because
the
civil
rights
movement
became
so
court
focused
I
think
that
there
was
a
tendency
to
lose
track
of
the
political
and
community
organizing
and
activities
on
the
ground
that
are
able
to
put
together
the
actual
coalitions
of
power
through
which
you
bring
about
redistributed
change
and
in
some
ways
we
still
suffer
from
that
MODERATOR
Let's
talk
with
Karen
Good
morning
Karen
you're
on
Chicago
Public
Radio
KAREN
Hi
The
gentleman
made
the
point
that
the
Warren
court
wasn't
terribly
radical
with
economic
changes
My
question
is
is
it
too
late
for
that
kind
of
reparative
work
economically
and
is
that
that
the
appropriate
place
for
reparative
economic
work
to
take
place
the
court
or
would
it
be
legislation
at
this
point
OBAMA
Maybe
I'm
showing
my
bias
here
as
a
legislator
as
well
as
a
law
professor
but
I'm
not
optimistic
about
bringing
about
major
redistributive
change
through
the
courts
The
institution
just
isn't
structured
that
way
You
just
look
at
very
rare
examples
during
the
desegregation
era
the
court
was
willing
to
for
example
order
changes
that
cost
money
to
a
local
school
district
The
court
was
very
uncomfortable
with
it
It
was
very
hard
to
manage
it
was
hard
to
figure
out
You
start
getting
into
all
sorts
of
separation
of
powers
issues
in
terms
of
the
court
monitoring
or
engaging
in
a
process
that
essentially
is
administrative
and
takes
a
lot
of
time
The
court's
just
not
very
good
at
it
and
politically
it's
very
hard
to
legitimize
opinions
from
the
court
in
that
regard
So
I
think
that
although
you
can
craft
theoretical
justifications
for
it
legally
Any
three
of
us
sitting
here
could
come
up
with
a
rationale
for
bringing
about
economic
change
through
the
courts

At
the
U.N
Many
Hope
for
an
Obama
Win
An
informal
survey
of
more
than
two
dozen
U.N
staff
members
and
foreign
delegates
showed
that
the
overwhelming
majority
would
prefer
that
Sen
Barack
Obama
win
the
presidency
saying
they
think
that
the
Democrat
would
usher
in
a
new
agenda
of
multilateralism
after
an
era
marked
by
Republican
disdain
for
the
world
body
Many
U.N
rank
and
file
are
less
circumspect
saying
they
see
in
Obama's
multicultural
background
a
Kenyan
father
an
Indonesian
stepfather
and
a
mother
and
grandparents
from
Kansas
a
reflection
of
themselves
We
do
not
consider
him
an
African
American
said
Congo's
U.N
ambassador
Atoki
Ileka
We
consider
him
an
African."U.S
Presidents
should
be
natural-born
Americans
not
only
in
the
technical
sense
required
by
the
Constitution
but
also
in
spirit
Clearly
that
is
the
intent
of
the
requirement
as
it
would
be
meaningless
otherwise
As
an
aside
those
left-leaning
Obama-apologists
at
Snopes.com
the
supposedly
definitive
source
for
urban
legend
debunking/verification
confidently
declare
the
claims
that
Obama
is
not
even
technically
qualified
to
be
Presdident
are
false
But

technical
qualification

I
Must

Racist
Just
got
a
charming
comment
from
an
Obama
supporter
Erica
has
left
a
new
comment
on
your
post
Just
Spreading
the
Wealth
Do
you
seriously
listen
to
yourself
Anti-Christ???Actually
I
said
I
didn't
know
But
Obama's
comments
about
building
a
Kingdom
on
Earth
are...interesting...and
those
votive
candles
with
his
likeness
sure
are
cute
Hey
Bush
has
destroyed
this
country
along
with
his
cronies...how
are
people
overlooking
the
last
8
years
AT
LEAST!!!Even
if
true
that
Bush
destroyed
the
country
which
is
ridiculous
he
and
his
administration
are
not
up
for
re-election
In
regards
to
your
stupid
act
against
that
hard
working
waitress
that
SERVED
you
YOU
ARE
DISGUSTING!To
anyone
who
can
read
it
would
be
clear
I
was
relating
a
story
from
someone
else
And
a
moment's
thought
would
reveal
it
is
likely
an
apocryphal
story
meant
as
a
metaphor
Of
course
it's
unfair
That's
the
point
of
showing
how
unfair
Obama's
plan
of
spreading
the
wealth
is
Obama
may
give
that
homeless
man
more
job
opportunities
so
he
can
provide
for
himself
but
Obama
is
not
going
to
redistribute
anyone's
wealth
to
give
someone
who
is
not
working
a
free
checkGiving
further
tax
breaks
to
people
already
paying
no
income
tax
sounds
like
a
free
check
to
me
Do
you
have
a
personal
issue
with
an
African-American
as
President
Be
honest
with
yourself...maybe
that
explains
why
you
will
believe
ANYTHING
negative
about
him
And
there
it
is
I
must
oppose
Obama
because
I'm
a
racist
rather
than
because
he's
a
Marxist

But
the

this
the

I
worry
GREENVILLE
South
Carolina
CNN
Republicans
no
longer
have
a
firm
grip
on
religion
in
political
discourse
Democratic
presidential
candidate
Sen
Barack
Obama
told
Sunday
worshippers
He
finished
his
brief
remarks
by
saying
We're
going
to
keep
on
praising
together
I
am
confident
that
we
can
create
a
Kingdom
right
here
on
Earth."Whoa
isn't
that
what
Jesus
is
supposed
to
do
From
the
mouth
of
Obama
himself
In
Christian
eschatology
the
Antichrist
or
anti-Christ
means
a
person
office
or
group
recognized
as
fulfilling
the
Biblical
prophecies
about
one
who
will
oppose
Christ
and
substitute
himself
in
Christ's
place
Antichrist
is
translated
from
the
combination
of
two
ancient
Greek
words
anti
Christos
In
Greek
means
anointed
one
and
Christians
apply
it
to
Jesus
of
Nazareth.[1
means
not
only
anti
in
the
sense
of
against
and
opposite
of
but
also
in
place
of".[2
Therefore
an
antichrist
opposes
Christ
by
substituting
himself
for
Christ.Interesting
Paul
writes
that
this
Man
of
Sin
sometimes
translated
son
of
perdition
will
possess
a
number
of
characteristics
These
include
sitting
in
the
temple
opposing
himself
against
anything
that
is
worshiped
claiming
divine
authority,[11
working
all
kinds
of
counterfeit
miracles
and
signs,[12
and
doing
all
kinds
of
evil.[13
Paul
notes
that
the
mystery
of
lawlessness"[14
though
not
the
Man
of
Sin
himself
was
working
in
secret
already
during
his
day
and
will
continue
to
function
until
being
destroyed
on
the
Last
Day.[15
His
identity
is
to
be
revealed
after
that
which
is
restraining
him
is
removed.[9][15
The
term
is
also
often
applied
to
prophecies
regarding
a
Little
horn
power
in
Daniel
7,[16
Daniel
9:27
mentions
an
abomination
that
causes
desolations
setting
itself
up
in
a
wing
or
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple.[17
A
wing
The
West
Wing
perhaps
Some
Futurists
hold
that
sometime
prior
to
the
expected
return
of
Jesus
there
will
be
a
period
of
great
tribulation"[40
during
which
the
Antichrist
indwelt
and
controlled
by
Satan
will
attempt
to
win
supporters
with
false
peace
supernatural
signs.This
is
not
an
original
observation
of
course
The
London
Sunday
Times
Online
ran
a
brilliant
satire
piece
called
He
ventured
forth
to
bring
light
into
the
world
A
sample
paragraph
When
he
was
12
years
old
they
found
him
in
the
temple
in
the
City
of
Chicago
arguing
the
finer
points
of
community
organization
with
the
Prophet
Jeremiah
and
the
Elders
And
the
Elders
were
astonished
at
what
they

and
said
among
themselves
Verily
who
is
this
Child
that
he
opens
our
hearts
and
minds
to
the
audacity
of

Just
Spreading
the
Wealth
Obama
says
he
wants
to
spread
the
wealth
around
for
fairness
reasons
whether
or
not
it
results
in
greater
revenue
for
the
government
lower
taxes
tend
to
promote
growth
and
hence
actually
increase
tax
revenue
An
interesting
experiment
found
on
a
comment
page
attributed
to
a
reader
of
the
Eagle
Tribune
Today
on
my
way
to
lunch
I
passed
a
homeless
guy
with
a
sign
the
read
Vote
Obama
I
need
the
money
I
laughed
Once
in
the
restaurant
my
server
had
on
a
Obama
08
tie
again
I
laughed--just
imagine
the
coincidence
When
the
bill
came
I
decided
not
to
tip
the
server
and
explained
to
him
that
I
was
exploring
the
Obama
redistribution
of
wealth
concept
He
stood
there
in
disbelief
while
I
told
him
that
I
was
going
to
redistribute
his
tip
to
someone
who
I
deemed
more
in
need--the
homeless
guy
outside
The
server
angrily
stormed
from
my
sight
I
went
outside
gave
the
homeless
guy
10
and
told
him
to
thank
the
server
inside
as
I
decided
he
could
use
the
money
more
The
homeless
guy
was
grateful
At
the
end
of
my
rather
unscientific
redistribution
experiment
I
realized
the
homeless
guy
was
grateful
for
the
money
he
did
not
earn
but
the
waiter
was
pretty
angry
that
I
gave
away
the
money
he
did
earn
even
though
the
actual
recipient
deserved
money
more
I
guess
redistribution
of
wealth
is
an
easier
thing
to
swallow
in
concept
than
in
practical
application.Interestingly
Obama
claims
he'll
give
a
tax
break
to
95
of
Americans
when
only
about
60
pay
income
taxes
That
means
the
40
who
already
pay
no
income
taxes
are
going
to
be
just
handed
cash
Your
cash
That's
welfare
not
a
tax
cut
Indeed
that
5
that
would
not
get
a
tax
cut
is
already
paying
HALF
of
all
taxes
collected
Imagine
suddenly
everyone
were
given
twice
as
much
money
as
they
had
before
but
no
actual
productive
increase
in
goods
or
services
had
taken
place
that's
what
handing
money
to
people
is
like
Because
the
cash
did
not
come
from
generating
wealth
in
the
form
of
new
goods
or
services
prices
of
everything
will
quickly
double
to
absorb
the
extra
money
because
things
are
just
as
scarce
as
they
were
before
and
nobody
gets
ahead
Indeed
the
disincentive
to
work
will
cause
a
contraction
of
living
standards
for
all
That's
Obama's
socialism
They
argue
people
pay
other
taxes
however
as
the
Wall
Street
Journal
points
out
giving
someone
a
Social
Security
tax
refund
out
of
Income
Tax
revenue
is
a
shell
game
Another
complaint
is
tax
cuts
benefit
the
rich
well
if
they
benefit
you
too
why
not
The
rich
are
paying
much
more
to
start
with
anyway
This
explanation
of
unknown
origin
is
actually
close
to
correct
numerically
Suppose
that
every
day
ten
men
go
out
for
beer
and
the
bill
for
all
ten
comes
to
100
If
they
paid
their
bill
the
way
we
pay
our
taxes
it
would
go
something
like
this
The
first
four
men
the
poorest
would
pay
nothing
The
fifth
would
pay
1
The
sixth
would
pay
3
The
seventh
would
pay
7
The
eighth
would
pay
12
The
ninth
would
pay
18
The
tenth
man
the
richest
would
pay
59
So
that's
what
they
decided
to
do
The
ten
men
drank
in
the
bar
every
day
and
seemed
quite
happy
with
the
arrangement
until
one
day
the
owner
threw
them
a
curve
Since
you
are
all
such
good
customers
he
said
I'm
going
to
reduce
the
cost
of
your
daily
beer
by
20
Drinks
for
the
ten
now
cost
just
80
The
group
still
wanted
to
pay
their
bill
the
way
we
pay
our
taxes
so
the
first
four
men
were
unaffected
They
would
still
drink
for
free
But
what
about
the
other
six
men
the
paying
customers
How
could
they
divide
the
20
windfall
so
that
everyone
would
get
his
fair
share
They
realized
that
20
divided
by
six
is
3.33
But
if
they
subtracted
that
from
everybody's
share
then
the
fifth
man
and
the
sixth
man
would
each
end
up
being
paid
to
drink
his
beer
So
the
bar
owner
suggested
that
it
would
be
fair
to
reduce
each
man's
bill
by
roughly
the
same
amount
and
he
proceeded
to
work
out
the
amounts
each
should
pay
And
so
The
fifth
man
like
the
first
four
now
paid
nothing
100
savings
The
sixth
now
paid
2
instead
of
3
33%savings
The
seventh
now
paid
5
instead
of
7
28%savings
The
eighth
now
paid
9
instead
of
12
25
savings
The
ninth
now
paid
14
instead
of
18
22
savings
The
tenth
now
paid
49
instead
of
59
16
savings
Each
of
the
six
was
better
off
than
before
and
the
first
four
continued
to
drink
for
free
But
once
outside
the
restaurant
the
men
began
to
compare
their
savings
I
only
got
a
dollar
out
of
the
20
declared
the
sixth
man
He
pointed
to
the
tenth
man
but
he
got
10
Yeah
that's
right
exclaimed
the
fifth
man
I
only
saved
a
dollar
too
It's
unfair
that
he
got
ten
times
more
than
I
That's
true
shouted
the
seventh
man
Why
should
he
get
10
back
when
I
got
only
two
The
wealthy
get
all
the
breaks
Wait
a
minute
yelled
the
first
four
men
in
unison
We
didn't
get
anything
at
all
The
system
exploits
the
poor
The
nine
men
surrounded
the
tenth
and
beat
him
up
The
next
night
the
tenth
man
didn't
show
up
for
drinks
so
the
nine
sat
down
and
had
beers
without
him
But
when
it
came
time
to
pay
the
bill
they
discovered
something
important
They
didn't
have
enough
money
between
all
of
them
for
even
half
of
the
bill
And
that
boys
and
girls
journalists
and
college
professors
is
how
our
tax
system
works
The
people
who
pay
the
highest
taxes
get
the
most
benefit
from
a
tax
reduction
Tax
them
too
much
attack
them
for
being
wealthy
and
they
just
may
not
show
up
anymore
In
fact
they
might
start
drinking
overseas
where
the
atmosphere
is
somewhat
friendlier

this
presidential
campaign
one
in
which
some
people
don't
mind
calling
Barack
Obama
a
dangerous
Muslim
a
terrorist
and
worse
Experts
agree
on
the
reasons
Obama
the
Democratic
nominee
is
different
from
any
other
major
presidential
candidate
in
history
in
many
ways
and
people
often
don't
accept
such
change
gracefully.The
implication
is
this
rejection
is
because
he's
black
No
it's
because
he's
socialist
A
great
many
people
think
they're
about
to
lose
power
The
world
is
changing
around
them
and
they
can't
stop
that
change
So
their
anger
is
boiling
over
said
Mark
Potok
the
director
of
the
intelligence
project
at
the
Southern
Poverty
Law
Center
which
tracks
hate
groups
The
nonstop
bile
flowing
toward
Obama
has
been
expressed
in
many
ways
Racism
People
for
the
American
Way
has
found
that
since
the
McCain
campaign
very
publicly
has
accused
ACORN
a
grass-roots
community
group
with
strong
ties
to
liberal
politicians
of
widespread
voter-registration
fraud
ACORN
offices
across
the
nation
have
been
subjected
to
an
onslaught
of
racist
and
threatening
voice
mails
and
e-mails."The
fraud
is
pretty
clear-cut
notice
how
ACORN's
illegal
activities
and
Obama's
ties
to
ACORN
are
deflected
by
charging
the
critics
are
racists
In
addition
Pier
said
many
older
voters
grew
up
when
racial
segregation
was
still
legal
haven't
necessarily
accepted
blacks
in
positions
of
power
and
are
afraid
of
having
a
black
president
Everything
these
people
have
stood
for
is
sort
of
being
questioned
and
to
some
degree
eliminated
by
Obama
said
David
Bositis
a
senior
research
associate
at
Washington's
Joint
Center
for
Political
and
Economic
Studies
which
studies
African-American
voting
trends
The
angry
voters
have
a
21st-century
way
to
come
together
instantly
and
share
misinformation
No
longer
do
most
people
get
news
from
newspapers
or
major
television
networks
instead
they
can
access
talk
shows
or
Internet
sites
that
are
sympathetic
to
their
own
views.So
being
against
Obama
is
a
priori
racism
And
the
internet
will
have
to
be
regulated
for
hate
speech
to
correct
the
misinformation
by
the
Ministry
of
Truth
This
is
the
last
straw
in
a
rapid
series
of
ever-more
outrageous
partisanship
by
the
media
Orson
Scott
Card
lays
out
a
laundry
list
of
one-sided
reporting
including
the
role
of
Democrats
in
the
Mortgage
Crisis
in
an
open
letter
to
the
media
If
you
do
not
tell
the
truth
about
the
Democrats
including
Barack
Obama
and
do
so
with
the
same
energy
you
would
use
if
the
miscreants
were
Republicans
then
you
are
not
journalists
by
any
standard
You're
just
the
public
relations
machine
of
the
Democratic
Party
and
it's
time
you
were
all
fired
and
real
journalists
brought
in
so
that
we
can
actually
have
a
news
paper
in
our
city.A
vile
non-newsworthy
attack
piece
on
Cindy
McCain
makes
the
front
page
of
the
New
York
Times...but
where
is
any
such
scrutiny
of
Michelle
Obama
Numerous
questions
about
Obama
go
unasked
by
the
media
such
as
Obama's
apparently
illegal
acceptance
of
speaking
fees
while
in
state
government
or
his
associations
with
self-proclaimed
anti-Americans
like
Rev
God
damn
Amerikkka
Wright
and
William
We
set
bombs
Ayers
or
shady
characters
like
slumlord
Tony
Rezko
and
Saddam
Hussein's
financier
and
international
criminal
Nadhmi
Auchi
or
his
membership
in
the
socialist
New
Party
yet
Joe
the
Plumber
gets
reamed
with
an
in-depth
media
probe
for
the
audacity
of
asking
Obama
a
question
when
picked
out
at
random
for
a
photo-op
Which
resulted
in
the
unguarded
comment
that
Obama
wished
to
spread
the
wealth
around
So
Obama
then
had
to
mock
the
plumber
Mocking
an
average
working
American
at
a
public
campaign
rally
Not
to
mention
the
disproportionate
scrutiny
e-mail-hacking
and
social
savaging
of
Sarah
Palin
But
no
it's
poor
Obama
who
is
the
victim
And
yet
all
the
real
violence
and
thuggery
is
coming
from
the
Left

Obama's
Terrorist
Pal
Obama
says
unrepentant
terrorist
William
Ayers
was
just
a
guy
in
the
neighborhood
Seems
there's
more
to
their
associations
Ayers
also
mentions
Obama
by
name
in
his
book
page
82
And
a
few
weeks
before
Obama's
review
was
published
on
Nov
20
1997
Obama
and
Ayers
were
both
on
a
panel
organized
by
Michelle
Obama
Children
who
kill
are
called
super
predators
people
with
no
conscience
feral
pre-social
beings
and
adults
William
Ayers
author
of
A
Kind
and
Just
Parent
The
Children
of
Juvenile
Court
Beacon
Press
1997
says
We
should
call
a
child
a
child
A
13-year-old
who
picks
up
a
gun
isn't
suddenly
an
adult
We
have
to
ask
other
questions
How
did
he
get
the
gun
Where
did
it
come
from
Ayers
who
spent
a
year
observing
the
Cook
County
Temporary
Juvenile
Detention
Center
in
Chicago
is
one
of
four
panelists
who
will
speak
on
juvenile
justice
at
6
p.m
Thursday
Nov
20
in
the
C-Shop
The
panel
which
marks
the
100th
anniversary
of
the
juvenile
justice
system
in
the
United
States
is
part
of
the
Community
Service
Center's
monthly
discussion
series
on
issues
affecting
the
city
of
Chicago
The
event
is
free
and
open
to
the
public
Ayers
will
be
joined
by
Sen
Barack
Obama
Senior
Lecturer
in
the
Law
School
who
is
working
to
combat
legislation
that
would
put
more
juvenile
offenders
into
the
adult
system
the
system
is
overcrowded
under-funded
over-centralized
and
racist
Ayers
said
Michelle
Obama
Associate
Dean
of
Student
Services
and
Director
of
the
University
Community
Service
Center
hopes
bringing
issues
like
this
to
campus
will
open
a
dialogue
between
members
of
the
University
community
and
the
broader
community.Not
to
mention
the
fundraiser
for
Obama
in
the
living
room
of
Ayers
and
the
even
more
loathesome
terrorist
Bernardine
Dohrn
which
during
the
last
debate
Obama
simply
dismissed
as
untrue
which
can
only
be
accurate
if
he's
splitting
hairs
over
the
claim
it
launched
his
political
career
or
not
as
the
event
surely
happened
And
not
to
mention
Ayers
getting
Obama
a
position
on
the
Chicago
Annenberg
Challenge
board
where
they
gave
out
money
to
support
educational
reform
Reform
as
viewed
by
an
unrepentant
Marxist-Leninist
domestic
bomber
who
likes
to
say
guilty
as
hell
free
as
a
bird
Educational
reform
from
this
person
The
Weatherman
leadership
including
Bill
Ayers
pushed
for
a
radical
reformulation
of
sexual
relations
under
the
slogan
Smash
Monogamy"Why
does
Obama
not
only
associate
with
such
terrorists
but
then
tries
to
deny
it
Why
the
ridiculous
counter-claim
that
Obama
was
only
8
years
old
when
the
Weathermen
were
bombing
things
That's
not
the
point
The
point
is
lefties
see
Ayers
as
an
acceptable
member
of
society
but
not
Sarah
Palin
Note
the
odious
defense
of
Ayers
by
the
token
leftie
at
the
Wall
Street
Journal
in
which
the
author
expresses
astonishment
at
the
vilification
of
Ayers
because
he
himself
is
a
friend
of
Ayers
just
like
Obama
and
Ayers
is
some
kind
of
inspiring
humanitarian
and
a
model
citizen
He
volunteers
for
everything
He
may
once
have
been
wanted
by
the
FBI
but
in
the
intervening
years
the
man
has
become
such
a
good
citizen
he
ought
to
be
an
honorary
Eagle
Scout.No
he
ought
to
be
in
prison
Now
factcheck.org
makes
light
of
the
Obama-Ayers
associations
Interestingly
factcheck.org
is
funded
by
the
Annenberg
Foundation
yeah
the
same
foundation
that
funded
Ayers
and
Obama
to
give
out
money
for
the
Chicago
Annenberg
Challenge

Hubris
Nation
could
face
short
Election
Night
Network
news
executives
said
they
are
preparing
for
an
unusual
Election
Night
challenge
How
to
be
honest
with
the
audience
and
still
keep
them
tuned
in
if
the
race
between
John
McCain
and
Barack
Obama
is
effectively
decided
before
most
Americans
have
finished
dinner
After
two
elections
in
which
the
suspense
went
far
into
the
evening
and
in
the
case
of
2000
for
36
days
afterward
the
executives
said
they
are
contemplating
how
to
manage
their
newscasts
in
the
event
of
an
Obama
blowout
in
which
the
Democrat's
victory
would
be
obvious
while
polls
are
still
open
in
most
of
the
country.Effectively
decided
They
mean
as
the
article
makes
clear
that
if
they
can
call
Virginia
for
Obama
the
moment
the
polls
close
at
7
pm
the
race
is
effectively
over
If
it
is
clear
on
Nov
4
that
Obama
has
won
in
Virginia
by
the
time
polls
there
close
at
7
p.m
it
will
still
be
daylight
west
of
the
Mississippi
the
obvious
conclusion
will
be
that
Obama
is
headed
to
the
White
House.Of
course
calling
a
state
the
moment
polls
close
relies
on
unreliable
exit
polling
data
Or
so
we're
told
In
effect
it
relies
on
simply
the
media's
declaration
of
an
Obama
victory
the
moment
polls
close
which
the
2004
election
showed
us
can
be
in
error
What
they
will
in
effect
be
doing
is
attempting
to
influence
voting
in
western
states
where
polls
are
still
open
to
discourage
turnout
by
McCain
supporters
by
declaring
an
early
7
pm
victory
for
Senator
Government
whether
it's
true
or
not
That's
the
cynical
way
of
looking
at
it
At
the
very
least
this
eagerness
to
view
the
outcome
as
simply
a
question
of
the
size
of
Obama's
victory
is
a
sign
of
uncontrolled
hubris
One
wonders
why
they're
even
waiting

Silver
Lining
Economic
woes
chill
effort
to
stop
global
warming
Only
months
ago
the
prospect
of
climate
legislation
passing
in
the
next
Congress
and
becoming
law
looked
promising
Both
presidential
candidates
Barack
Obama
and
John
McCain
support
mandatory
emission
cuts
and
a
Democratic
majority
vowed
to
act
on
the
problem
early
in
the
new
year
But
the
most
popular
remedy
for
slowing
global
warming
a
mechanism
known
as
cap-and-trade
could
put
further
stress
on
a
teetering
economy
by
raising
energy
prices
Democrats
in
both
the
House
and
Senate
have
unveiled
draft
climate
bills
But
their
supporters
acknowledge
that
the
bills
may
have
to
be
changed
given
the
economic
situation
For
example
a
proposal
to
auction
off
emission
permits
a
source
of
money
to
help
refocus
the
nation's
use
of
energy
away
from
fossil
fuels
may
have
to
be
abandoned
with
permits
distributed
for
free
But
some
Republicans
argue
the
whole
idea
of
a
climate
bill
ought
to
be
scrapped
for
the
time
being
Limits
of
carbon
dioxide
would
increase
energy
costs
and
lead
the
country
off
the
economic
cliff

Who
Created
the
Subprime
Credit
Crisis
Over-leveraged
banks
are
at
the
core
of
the
problem
But
why
did
they
make
so
many
loans
to
people
who
couldn't
afford
them
Simple
greed
Or
were
class
and
race-based
politics
involved
See
this
well-documented
revealing
video
The
villains
are
Democrats
Chris
Dodd
Barack
Obama
and
Barney
Frank
using
the
government-sponsored
agencies
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
to
direct
patronage
in
the
form
of
govt-backed
mortgages
to
their
non-credit-worthy
constituents
Banks
that
balked
were
threatened
with
lawsuits
for
being
racist
by
lawyers
like
Barack
Obama
Who
along
with
other
dirty
Congressmen
mostly
Democrats
then
received
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
campaign
contributions
from
those
government
agencies
And
who
then
turned
around
and
employed
the
same
corrupt
officers
of
those
institutions
in
their
campaigns
John
McCain
and
President
Bush
tried
to
reform
the
agencies
at
various
times
but
were
rebuffed
And
the
Democrats
have
the
gall
to
accuse
the
Republicans
of
causing
the
crisis

Iraq
Now
A
Success
Well
what
do
you
know
the
public
is
now
seeing
the
Iraq
War
as
a
success
For
the
first
time
since
Rasmussen
Reports
began
polling
on
the
issue
a
plurality
of
voters
in
September
say
the
U.S
mission
in
Iraq
will
be
viewed
as
a
success
in
the
long
term
In
a
national
telephone
survey
Monday
night
41
said
history
will
rate
the
war
in
Iraq
a
success
versus
39
who
said
it
will
be
seen
as
a
failure
with
20
undecided
see
crosstabs
These
findings
echo
those
of
the
previous
two
weeks
see
trends
By
contrast
in
August
of
last
year
57
believed
history
would
judge
the
U.S
mission
in
Iraq
a
failure
and
only
29
disagreed
Similarly
46
say
the
United
States
is
safer
today
than
before
the
terrorist
attacks
on
September
11
2001
but
34
disagree.Funny
how
this
breaks
down
The
partisan
gap
on
these
questions
is
enormous
Seventy-three
percent
73
of
Republicans
say
the
U.S
mission
in
Iraq
will
be
viewed
as
a
success
in
the
long-term
but
only
16
of
Democrats
agree
Unaffiliated
voters
are
evenly
divided
Seventy-six
percent
76
of
Republicans
say
the
situation
in
Iraq
will

Who
Supports
Obama
One
wonders
just
who
in
the
world
would
support
Obama
What
could
they
possibly
be
thinking
Now
we
know
In
this
eye-opening
Rasmussen
poll
on
the
Supreme
Court
While
82
of
voters
who
support
McCain
believe
the
justices
should
rule
on
what
is
in
the
Constitution
just
29
of
Barack
Obama's
supporters
agree
Just
11
of
McCain
supporters
say
judges
should
rule
based
on
the
judge's
sense
of
fairness
while
nearly
half
49
of
Obama
supporters
agree.That
sums
it
up
McCain
supporters
ovewhelming
respect
the
Constitution
Obama's
tend
not
to
They
expect
he'll
ram
through
their
notions
of
fairness
for
their
concept
of
the
greater
good
regardless
of
carefully
crafted
Constitutional
procedures
checks
and
balances
the
classic
set-up
for
revolutionary
dictatorship
And
all
with
the
best
of
intentions
Also
shocking
is
that
of
all
American
voters
fully
30
don't
understand
the
importance
of
the
Constitution
and
they
are
almost
all
Obama
supporters
During
his
acceptance
speech
last
night
at
the
Republican
National
Convention
in
Minnesota
John
McCain
told
the
audience
We
believe
in
a
strong
defense
work
faith
service
a
culture
of
life
personal
responsibility
the
rule
of
law
and
judges
who
dispense
justice
impartially
and
don't
legislate
from
the
bench
Most
American
voters
60
agree
and
say
the
Supreme
Court
should
make
decisions
based
on
what
is
written
in
the
constitution
while
30
say
rulings
should
be
guided
on
the
judge's
sense
of
fairness
and
justice
The
number
who
agree
with
McCain
is
up
from
55
in
August.The
educational
system
has
failed

Thirty
Years
War
And
I
don't
mean
the
war
from
1618-1648
but
rather
the
one
with
Iran
that's
been
going
on
since
1979
Though
both
are
religious
wars
Is
a
counterstrike
finally
coming
The
Secret
War
With
Iran
In
August
2007
because
certain
intelligence
agencies
were
not
convinced
of
Israeli
claims
that
President
Bashar
Assad
was
engaged
in
the
construction
of
a
nuclear
weapons
facility
Israel
sent
sent
12
members
of
the
Sayeret
Matkal
commando
unit
into
Syria
in
two
helicopters
to
collect
soil
samples
outside
the
site
in
question
The
results
provided
clear-cut
proof
of
the
nuclear
project
investigative
journalist
Ronen
Bergman
writes
in
his
new
book
The
Secret
War
with
Iran
A
month
later
Israel
bombed
the
site
and
in
so
doing
reemphasized
the
Begin
Doctrine
Israel's
insistence
that
for
the
sake
of
its
own
survival
it
will
not
allow
the
deployment
by
hostile
neighbors
of
weapons
that
might
be
used
to
destroy
it
Bergman's
book
which
will
be
published
next
week
in
the
United
States
is
an
expanded
updated
version
of
his
Hebrew-language
The
Point
of
No
Return
which
was
Israel's
best-selling
non-fiction
work
in
2007
Plainly
the
author
has
been
allowed
access
to
a
range
of
material
hitherto
kept
classified
by
various
intelligence
services
Plainly
too
what
he
is
publishing
is
material
that
Israel
is
content
to
have
widely
disseminated
and
some
of
which
cannot
be
independently
verified
The
book
was
submitted
to
censorship
and
not
all
of
its
content
was
approved
he
told
me
when
he
dropped
off
a
copy
a
few
days
ago
though
it
did
sometimes
seem
as
though
he
had
run
into
the
censor
on
a
relatively
benign
day
Most
notable
perhaps
in
this
context
is
the
fact
that
the
guardians
of
Israel's
military
secrets
have
allowed
Bergman
to
provide
a
fairly
extensive
account
of
that
September
6
2007
raid
on
Syria's
nuclear
facility
whose
purpose
he
states
unambiguously
was
the
production
of
plutonium
for
the
manufacture
of
atomic
bombs
and
whose
construction
he
reports
was
a
tripartite
endeavor
At
a
series
of
secret
meetings
between
representatives
of
the
three
sides
held
mainly
in
Teheran
it
was
decided
that
Syria
would
supply
the
territory
Iran
the
money
1
billion-$2b
and
North
Korea
the
expertise
Last
year's
raid
was
the
subject
of
some
of
the
heaviest
military
censorship
that
I
have
encountered
in
the
past
25
years
Israel
was
desperate
to
take
no
official
responsibility
for
the
attack
and
in
this
way
to
allow
Damascus
plausible
deniability
to
avoid
a
deterioration
into
war
There
was
no
official
confirmation
of
the
raid
and
for
a
long
time
after
it
all
references
in
the
Israeli
media
had
to
include
conditioning
phrases
such
as
the
reported
Israeli
strike
Apparently
such
concerns
no
longer
apply
Bergman
has
been
freed
to
describe
without
the
censor's
usual
required
attribution
to
foreign
sources
the
entire
process
by
which
the
Syrian
facility
was
built
with
details
of
the
shipments
of
material
from
North
Korea
and
the
dispatch
of
Korean
scientists
He
sets
out
the
circumstances
of
that
high-risk
August
fact-finding
mission
by
Sayeret
Matkal
And
he
is
allowed
to
note
that
a
number
of
North
Koreans
were
killed
in
the
Israeli
attack
Although
destroying
the
site
was
an
Israeli
operation
Bergman
makes
clear
further
that
the
Israelis
and
the
Americans
decided
to
act
and
that
the
two
countries
coordinated
on
the
official
silence
policy
after
the
raid
was
successfully
completed
Prime
Minister
Olmert
and
President
Bush
decided
that
both
countries
would
maintain
a
policy
of
total
nonreaction
without
exceptions
and
without
winks
or
nods
If
the
Syrians
had
not
been
in
a
hurry
to
issue
their
own
statements
the
whole
matter
might
not
have
been
disclosed
at
all
A
few
weeks
ago
the
White
House
took
the
unusual
step
of
issuing
a
specific
denial
of
a
report
on
Army
Radio
picked
up
by
the
Post
which
claimed
that
a
Bush
official
recently
told
his
Israeli
counterparts
that
the
president
is
planning
to
strike
Iran's
nuclear
facilities
before
leaving
office
Only
this
week
a
newspaper
in
The
Netherlands
claimed
that
Dutch
intelligence
has
abruptly
halted
an
extremely
successful
ongoing
operation
to
sabotage
Iran's
nuclear
program
because
of
an
assessment
that
such
an
American
strike
is
indeed
just
weeks
away
A]s
of
May
2008
the
Mossad's
estimate
is
that
Bush
out
of
religious
and
ideological
motives
will
order
a
strike
But
the
real
threat
the
player
that
gave
Iran
the
vital
resources
to
stride
forward
was
Pakistan
via
its
notorious
nuclear
salesman
Dr
Abdul
Qadeer
Khan.Plenty
more
so
