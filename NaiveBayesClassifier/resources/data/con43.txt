To

providing

preventing
disruption

amend

provide

conservation
to
extend

provisions

provide

Yes...emphases
added
by
me
About
50
of
the
bill
is
for
other
purposes
and
about
5
of
it
deals
with
troubled
assets
This
bill
is
a
mistake
It
simply
demonstrates
how
non-serious
Congress
really
is
about
the
whole
thing
If
we
really
need
an
emergency
act
to
correct
this
problem
then
spend
a
week
discussing

debating
provisions
put
them
together
in

clean

without
any
cling-ons

And
they
have
to
have
a
diameter

be

If
they
aren't
suitable

are
they
really
arrows
Wouldn't
it
just
be
a
sharp
stick
made

wood
with
no

This
is
a
stellar
example
of
why
there
needs
to
be
a
law
that
requires
every

every

to
identify

The

Government
Emergency
Bill
I've
browsed
the
bill
and
I'm
really
not
very
impressed
First
it
is
a
whopping
451
pages
long
It
starts
with
the
rationale
behind
the
bill
pending
economic
disaster
and
then
goes
into
the
provisions
of
the
bailout
Pretty
dull
stuff
to
be
honest
Then
on
Page
97
I
found
this
little
gem
18
SEC
204
EMERGENCY
TREATMENT
19
All
provisions
of
this
Act
are
designated
as
an
emer
20
gency
requirement
and
necessary
to
meet
emergency
needs
21
pursuant
to
section
204(a

concurrent
resolution
on
the
budget
for

23

2008
and
rescissions
of
any
amounts
provided
in
this
24
Act
shall
not
be
counted
for
purposes
of
budget
enforce
25
ment
This
tells
me
two
things
First
the
spending
in
this
bill
comes
from
this
year
but
doesn't
count
against
this
year's
budget
The
other
thing
is
that
this
should
indicate
that
everything
in
this
bill
is
a
critical
measure
that
will
help
deal
with
this
financial
crisis
Thus
the
bill
should
be
very
lean
and
non-related
items
should
have
been
left
out
at
least
according
to
Section
204
right
Wrong
It
looks
like
the
vast
majority
of
the
bill
consists
of
a
laundry
lists
of
special
new
or
increased
tax
breaks
for
certain
groups
as
well
as
a
few
negative
tax
breaks
for
others
A
section
which
addresses
a
plethora
of
energy
related
tax
breaks
ends
with
the
following

The

of

shall

REPORT
Not
later
than
2
years
after
the
date
21
of

of
this
Act
the
National

shall
submit
to

a
report

AUTHORIZATION
OF
APPROPRIATIONS
There
is
25
authorized
to
be
appropriated
to
carry
out
this
section
26
1,500,000
for
the
period
of
fiscal
years
2009
and
2010
So
in
an
effort
to
solve
the
emergency
financial
crisis
Congress
has
decided
it
was
prudent
to
spend
1.5
million
dollars
examining
the
tax
code
in
an
effort
to
find
a
way
to
tweak
it
to
prevent
global
warming
It
is
unfortunate
that
it
would
cost
so
much
to
simply
review
the
existing
tax
code
but
it
does
since
the
code
is
overly
complicated
and
no
thanks
to
Congress
for
that
Of
course
this
number
doesn't
count
toward
this
year's
budget
so
it
is
actually
a
free
accounting
or
at
least
free
from
budgetary
review
All
in
the
name
of
global
warming
impending
financial
doom
More
to
come
if
my
blood
pressure
can
handle
further
examination
of
this
bill
You
know
why
it
is
called
a
bill
right
Because
you
and
I
will
be
paying
for
it
for
decades

After

years

How
We
Got
There
Fred/Fann
This
is
a
very
nice
and
concise
explanation
of
how
we
got
into
the
current
financial
mess
Sometimes
the
greatest
blame
comes
from
great
praise
when
viewed
in
hindsight
The
Los
Angeles
Times
proves
that
with
an
article
from
1999
heaping
praise
on
the
very
people
most
responsible
for
the
credit-market
meltdown
Ronald
Brownstein
lauded
the
Clinton
administration
for
boosting
minority
ownership
by
forcing
lenders
to
offer
better
terms
to
marginally-qualified
borrowers
and
noted
the
financial
creativity
from
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
as
a
crucial
component
of
Bill
Clinton's
efforts
It
also
demonstrates
why
Congress
mandated
the
failure
of
the
lending
system
and
why
it
has
to
act
to
fix
it
via
Hot
Air
reader
abinitoadinfinitum
Obviously
you
will
have
to
go
read
the
whole
thing
for
the
full
explanation
And
no
I'm
not
of
the
opinion
that
this
problem
is
the
fault
of
one
party
or
the
other
It
is
a
bi-partisan
problem
and
there
were
voices
of
caution
and
reason
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
