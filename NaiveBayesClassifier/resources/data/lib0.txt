Story

Bush
Hank
Paulson
and
Ben
Bernanke
by

Story
for
George
Bush
Hank
Paulson
and
Ben
Bernanke
My
wife
and
I
are
renters
we
figured
we
never
could
justify
paying
the
crazy
prices
we
saw
people
charging
for
houses
But
now
the
bubble
burst
and
we
figured
OK
now's
our
time
So
there's
this
house
my
wife
likes
A
lot
So
much
so
that
we've
had
our
eye
on
it
for
the
past
six
months
Here's
the
story
We
were
driving
through
a
neighborhood
she
likes
and
saw
a
For
Sale
sign
We
made
an
appointment
and
saw
the
house
A
week
later
my
wife
called
the
woman
who
owned
the
place
to
discuss
making
an
offer
We
had
a
figure
in
mind
that
worked
out
to
precisely
the
price
you
see
on
Zillow
and
which
if
you
work
backward
from
her
property
tax
bill
tells
you
was
the
about
the
figure
the
property
tax
assessor
had
come
up
with
at
the
last
assessment
Put
another
way
given
the
bubble
burst
the
bid
we
made
was
higher
than
I
was
comfortable
with
but
my
wife
really
really
liked
the
house
and
in
its
defense
there
had
been
some
nice
work
done
inside
The
woman
turned
down
our
offer
She
claimed
she
needed
to
get
40
more
just
to
pay
what
she
owed
on
the
house
We
offered
to
try
to
deal
with
Countrywide
to
arrange
a
short
sale
but
she
simply
stopped
responding
to
us
It
turns
out
the
home
had
been
up
for
sale
for
well
over
a
year
there's
no
chance
she
could
have
gotten
that
price
even
before
the
bubble
burst
We
then
learned
the
property
was
in
the
foreclosure
process
The
sheriff's
assessment
of
the
house
was
actually
more
than
10
below
the
price
we
had
offered
And
I
might
add
within
a
few
thousand
dollars
of
the
price
I
told
my
wife
the
house
was
worth
when
we
first
contacted
the
woman
who
owned
it
So
we
showed
up
on
the
day
of
the
sheriff's
auction
when
the
home
was
going
to
be
up
for
bid
but
she
had
declared
bankruptcy
that
morning
which
apparently
removes
the
home
from
the
to
be
auctioned
list
Since
my
wife
was
still
interested
in
the
home
and
bankruptcy
filings
are
public
records
we
took
a
look
Here's
what
we
learned
the
amount
owed
to
Countrywide
is
140
of
the
sheriff's
assessed
value
and
of
course
the
odds
of
it
fetching
the
sheriff's
assessed
value
is
quite
low
even
in
good
times
Plus
it
seems
the
woman's
other
debts
mean
her
total
debt
is
more
than
twice
what
she
owes
on
her
mortgage
and
she
has
no
job
I'm
not
sure
what
the
woman
or
Countrywide
were
thinking
but
hey
this
is
why
I
didn't
buy
a
house
before
So
we've
contacted
Countrywide
to
make
another
offer
taking
into
account
the
current
circumstances
Our
offer
is
equal
to
what
we
think
that
house
would
fetch
at
the
auction
No
yes
no
no
no
nothing
We
contacted
them
repeatedly
According
to
the
bankruptcy
filing
the
woman
intends
to
surrender
the
home
to
Countrywide
I
can't
imagine
she
has
much
of
a
choice
in
the
circumstances
So
in
a
few
weeks
they
will
take
possession
of
the
house
I
don't
see
any
way
that
a
deal
can
be
worked
out
with
the
woman
who
borrowed
the
money
to
buy
it
in
the
first
place
Remember
debts
equal
to
twice
the
outstanding
mortgage
plus
no
income
So
they
either
sell
the
house
or
pay
for
its
maintenance
and
property
taxes
You'd
think
in
this
environment
Countrywide
would
have
some
interest
in
talking
to
eager
potential
buyers
You'd
be
wrong
Its
one
thing
to
bail
out
companies
that
got
themselves
in
trouble
doing
stupid
things
as
we're
doing
to
Countrywide's
now
parent-company
Its
another
to
bail
them
out
when
they
go
out
of
their
way
to
avoid
developing
a
viable
business
model
And
its
not
just
that
the
plan
is
rewarding
companies
that
made
insane
decisions
and
encouraging
them
to
make
new
insane
decisions
It
also
impedes
the
market
and
ties
up
capital
by
preventing
willing
responsible
buyers
with
money
in
their
pockets
from
buying
homes
This
is
the
very
predictable
result
of
the
bail-out
Mission
Accomplished

Two
Wings
of
the
Republican
Party
by
cactus
Two
Wings
of
the
Republican
Party
A
few
facts
labeled
with
F"s
and
a
few
questions
labeled
with
Q"s
F1
Sarah
Palin
has
stated
that
if
McCain
loses
she
will
stay
on
the
national
stage
and
perhaps
seek
the
top
spot
herself
in
2012
F2
Sarah
Palin's
presence
on
the
ticket
has
energized
much
of
what
one
might
term
the
Moral
Majority
wing
of
the
Republican
Party
F3
Sarah
Palin's
presence
on
the
ticket
has
horrified
much
of
what
one
might
term
the
intellectual
wing
of
the
Republican
Party
and
has
been
cited
as
a
reason
for
several
prominent
members
of
this
wing
endorsing
Obama
Q1
Why
are
the
intellectuals
so
horrified
by
Palin
She
doesn't
seem
so
different
from
Dan
Quayle
or
GW
Bush
for
that
matter
She
also
doesn't
seem
all
that
different
from
Mike
Huckabee
sure
he
was
not
the
intellectual"'s
first
choice
but
I
can't
imagine
if
Huckabee
had
pulled
off
the
nomination
the
intellectuals
would
be
in
this
much
of
a
snit
What
am
I
missing
here
Q2
A
follow-up
to
Q1
Given
that
the
intellectuals
worship
at
the
altar
of
Reagan
and
Reagan
was
essentially
the
one
who
created
the
Moral
Majority
wing
of
the
Republican
Party
as
it
now
stands
is
it
inconsistent
of
the
intellectuals
to
get
this
incensed
by
the
Moral
Majority
wing's
champion
Q3
If
F2
and
F3
remain
as
they
are
would
the
Republican
party
be
fractured
by
a
Palin
nomination
in
2012

Election
Story
Interlude
In
contrast
to
Mankiw's
attitude
see
cactus's
post
below
my
favorite
election
story
of
the
year
comes
from
Ms
Mochi_tsuki
So
they
started
explaining
to
me
what
an
absentee
ballot
is
and
how
to
fill
one
out
I
pointed
out
that
I'd
spent
11
years
of
my
adult
life
overseas
and
was
very
familiar
with
the
process
One
of
them
pointed
to
the
other
and
said
He's
been
overseas
as
well
He's
a
retired
Admiral
WTF
You
may
know
this
but
by
law
there
are
never
more
than
about
200
Admirals
in
service
Really
rare
creatures
those
This
one
Retired
last
month
And
he's
spending
his
weekends
working
on
the
GOTV
effort
in
rural
Virginia
But
I
guess
retired
Admirals
don't
need
the
motivations
that
economics
professors
do
In
fairness
to
Mankiw
he
knows
his
numbers
are
b.s
The
giveaway
In
a
sense
putting
the
various
pieces
of
the
tax
system
together
I
would
be
facing
a
marginal
tax
rate
of
93
percent

mine
Not
to
mention
the

tax

finesse
and

Mankiw's
Incentives
I
know
this
has
received
comment
here
at
Angry
Bear
a
few
weeks
back
sorry
I'm
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
find
the
link
right
now
but
a
post
by
Greg
Mankiw
looking
at
his
own
incentive
structure
under
the
proposed
Obama
and
McCain
tax
systems
sticks
in
my
craw
He
writes
That
is
Obama's
proposed
tax
hikes
reduce
my
incentive
to
work
by
62
percent
compared
to
the
McCain
plan
and
by
93
percent
compared
to
the
no-tax
scenario
In
a
sense
putting
the
various
pieces
of
the
tax
system
together
I
would
be
facing
a
marginal
tax
rate
of
93
percent
The
bottom
line
If
you
are
one
of
those
people
out
there
trying
to
induce
me
to
do
some
work
for
you
there
is
a
good
chance
I
will
turn
you
down
And
the
likelihood
will
go
up
after
President
Obama
puts
his
tax
plan
in
place
I
expect
to
spend
more
time
playing
with
my
kids
They
will
be
poorer
when
they
grow
up
but
perhaps
they
will
have
a
few
more
happy
memories.Wonderful
Someone
should
inform
him
that
the
employment
to
population
ratio
is
lower
now
than
it
was
when
the
President
he
advised
took
office
lower
than
when
that
President
began
following
policies
Mr
Mankiw
promoted
and
supported
and
lower
than
it
was
than
when
he
officially
became
his
President's
chief
economic
advisor
Most
of
these
extra
unemployed
not
to
mention
the
extra
underemployed
folks
are
not
there
because
they
chose
to
spend
more
time
with
their
kids
Their
kids
will
grow
up
poorer
and
with
memories
of
seeing
their
parents
worry
about
paying
the
bills
and
putting
food
on
the
table
See
very
very
little
of
what
Mankiw's
President
and
Mankiw
said
when
it
comes
to
the
economy
came
to
pass
Their
policies
have
not
worked
And
now
Mankiw
tells
us
about
his
own
work
incentives
Its
a
pity
they
can't
be
applied
retroactively
maybe
millions
of
people
didn't
have
to
be
made
poorer
if
folks
like
Mankiw
and
his
President
could
have
been
induced
to
leave
the
rest
of
us
alone

by

professor

analysis
at
The
New
School
for
Social
Research
in

Committee
on
her
proposal
George
Miller
Looking
at
redirecting
tax
breaks
to
a
new
system
of
guaranteed
retirement
accounts
At
that
hearing
the
director
of
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
Peter
Orszag
testified
that
some
2
trillion
in
retirement
savings
has
been
lost
over
the
past
15
months
Under
Ms
Ghilarducci's
plan
all
workers
would
receive
a
600
annual
inflation-adjusted
subsidy
from
the
U.S
government
but
would
be
required
to
invest
5
of
their
pay
into
a
guaranteed
retirement
account
administered
by
the
Social
Security
Administration
The
money
in
turn
would
be
invested
in
special
government
bonds
that
would
pay
3
a
year
adjusted
for
inflation
The
current
system
of
providing
tax
breaks
on
401(k
contributions
and
earnings
would
be
eliminated
I
have
not
read
anything
from

it

I
Don't
Do
Market
Timing
Starting
in
September
my

such
as
it
were
is
basically
in
C
Stephen
Gordon
explains
with
graphics
why
that
has
been
such
a
bad
trade
The
scariest
part
The
2002-2008
expansion
provided
significant
real
income
gains
and
more
than
half
of
those
gains
were
due
to
the
improvement
in
Canada's
terms
of
trade
So
there
really
isn't
an
infrastructure
in
place
to
benefit
from
autonomy

Harper

Is
Douglas
Holtz-Eakin
still
an
economist
Via
Dr
Black
we
get
CNN
reporting
Younger
healthier
workers
likely
wouldn't
abandon
their
company-sponsored
plans
said
Douglas
Holtz-Eakin
McCain's
senior
economic
policy
adviser
Why
would
they
leave
said
Holtz-Eakin
What
they
are
getting
from
their
employer
is
way
better
than
what
they
could
get
with
the
credit
And
why
is
it
better
Because
of
the
tax
credit
that
is
going
away
But
let's
be
nice
to
a
man
who
has
in
the
past
few
months
eliminated
his
credibility
to
ensure
that
no
ex-GWBush
Administration
official
retains
his
or
her
reputation
after
leaving
office
Let's
assume
he's
telling
the
truth
So
the
young
healthy
workers
stay
with
the
employer
plan
that
miraculously
doesn't
go
away
in
a
miasma
of
Moral
Hazard
This
leaves
the
older
workers
who
no
longer
get
a
decent
deal
from
their
employer
to
find
something
in
the
marketplace
Gosh
guess
what
happens
when
your
selection
group
becomes
more
Adverse
Costs
go
up
So
let's
review
what
Holtz-Eakin
has
actually
declared
explicitly
and
by
implication
Younger
workers
will
keep
the
employer-provided
health
insurance
since
it
would
cost
them
more
to
buy
on
their
own
Older
workers
won't
be
provided
with
insurance
and
it
will
cost
them
Even
More
than
More
to
buy
health
insurance
on
their
own
Even
if
we
were
ignoring
that
Health
Insurance
is
NOT
HEALTH
CARE
John
McCain's
proposal
by
the
admission
of
his
own
Economic
Advisor
makes
the
current
situation
appear
Pareto-optimal
Which
leaves
us
only
one
question
Why
would
any
economist
support
it
I
should
probably
stipulate
positive
here
For
instance
anyone
who
followed
Condi
I
was
National
Security
Advisor
on
11
Sep
2001
Rice's
prior
career
wouldn't
have
expected
much
from
her
Using
the
actual
Health
Economics
definition
here
not
the
generic
phrase
to
describe
why
we
need
to
give
Goldman
Sachs
and
Jamie
Dimon
700
Billion
Yes
I'm
shouting
Claiming
to
address
health
care
when
all
you
address
is
health
insurance
is

a
watershed
moment
or
not
by
rdan
An
opinion
at
Salon
caught
my
attention....here
is
part
of
the
main
point
As
his
campaign
manager
has
described
it
John
McCain
is
now
looking
at
a
narrow-victory
scenario
The
fact
that
we're
in
the
race
at
all
added
Steve
Schmidt
is
a
miracle
Because
the
environment
is
so
bad
and
the
head
wind
is
so
strong
But
talk
of
miracles
and
head
winds
aside
I
think
John
McCain
really
does
have
a
decent
shot
at
winning
and
that's
not
just
because
I'm
a
longtime
Republican
political
operative
Despite
what
the
polls
seem
to
be
saying
a
closer
look
at
the
numbers
shows
that
a
Democratic
victory
is
not
a
foregone
conclusion
Why
Because
if
history
is
any
guide
Barack
Obama
as
an
African-American
candidate
for
political
office
needs
to
be
polling
consistently
above
50
percent
to
win
And
in
crucial
battleground
states
he
isn't
I
do
not
care
about
the
Bradley
effect
chatter
I
will
be
watching
how
the
votes
are
counted
in
different
states
either
by
per
centages
provisional
votes
and
possible
challenges
and
exit
polling
versus
reported
counts

a
race

meets
the
eye

Notice
anything
about
these
3
groups
of
income
tax
rates
No
I'm
not
suggesting
that
the
lower
rates
are
the
smoking
gun
of
today's
economic
crap
Don't
want
to
run
afoul
of
those
scoldings
of
association
is
not
causation
critiques
But
do
you
not
find
it
just
a
bit
curious
that
approximately
8
years
prior
to
an
economic
troubling
time
we
get
talked
into
reducing
that
tax
rates
Three
periods
in
history
all
preceding
an
economy
of
crap
Varying
degrees
of
crap
but
crap
just
the
same
We
even
had
a
housing
bubble
for
2
of
them
None
of
these
tax
changes
can
happen
without
convincing
A
dialog
has
to
have
happened
to
convince
the
people
that
it
is
a
good
idea
And
I
bet
that
the
rhetoric
of
tax
reduction
is
only
part
of
a
package
regarding
the
overall
idea
of
what
is
best
to
grow
the
economy
I
bet
that
tax
reduction
presentations
have
never
been
presented
as
a
stand
alone
single
issue
unrelated
to
accomplishing
a
larger
money
shift
Being
that
we
are
relating
today
to
the
Big
One
while
at
the
same
time
hearing
muttering
that
we
are
in
new
territory
my
Angry
Bear
side
asked
What
else
is
similarly
presented
in
the
20's
as
part
of
a
sales
job
of
an
over
all
ideology
that
preceded
today's
and
yesterday's
crap
Installment
Sell
Manufacturers
realized
they
could
expand
their
profits
if
they
could
grow
their
markets
and
so
installment
selling
was
introduced
The
increased
production
volumes
reduced
the
unit
cost
of
items
making
them
more
affordable
and
easy
terms
made
for
easy
sales
There
is
a
reprint
of
an
article
specifically
looking
at
the
pros
and
cons
of
credit
purchasing
Rather
fascinating
reading
PAYING
FOR
THINGS
ON
EASY
TERMS
has
become
such
a
conspicuous
element
in
American
life
and
so
large
a
factor
in
our
prosperity
that
the
economists
have
been
doing
a
great
deal
of
worrying
about
it

Sub-prime
anyone
Oh
did
you
notice
that
it
was
a
concerted
effort
to
sell
the
consumer
that
installment
purchasing
was
good
I
wonder
if
blaming
the
consumer
for
spending
what
they
did
not
have
was
part
of
the
discussion
when
the
economy
turned
to
crap
then
THE
CHRISTMAS
CHEER
IN
WALL
STREET
1926
Christmas
distribution
of
bonuses
in
Wall
Street
when
finally
added
up
is
expected
to
prove
the
most
generous
ever
made
except
during
some
of
the
flush
World
War
years
No
accurate
account
of
sums
paid
out
can
be
made
according
to
the
New
York
Times
because
many
firms
do
not
announce
their
benefactions
but
last
year's
total
was
estimated
at
50,000,000
and
it
is
expected
that
the
Wall
Street
firms
paying
bonuses
are
being
no
less
generous
this
year
In
fact
some
firms
which
have
never
paid
bonuses
will
start
the
custom
this
Christmas
Probably
the
largest
distribution
we
read
is
being
made
by
banks
which
have
been
exceptionally
prosperous.Converting
that
50
million
we
get
various
amounts
586
million
via
CPI
494
million
via
GDP
deflator
and
drum
roll
please
1.999
million
via
unskilled
wage
factor
There
was
one
perspective
that
was
not
accurate
in
their
prophecies
for
America
America
has
played
square
in
China
and
will
have
an
inside
track
in
China
against
the
commerce
of
other
nations
China
buys
one
billion
dollars
worth
of
outside
goods
every
year
But
that's
only
a
drop
in
the
bucket
compared
with
what
this
customer
may
buy
some
day
When
the
per
capita
foreign
trade
of
China
runs
one
government
report
is
equal
to
that
of
Australia
the
total
will
be
sixty-five
billion
dollars
a
year
which
China
will
pay
to
the
outside
world
for
her
imports
You
can't
help
seeing
American
business
grow
in
China
a
business
man
from
China
told
me
Why
it
has
multiplied
itself
by
four
within
the
past
dozen
years
It's
eight
times
bigger
than
it
was
thirty
years
ago
The
inaccuracy
The
quotes
are
from
a
perspective
of
the
American
selling
to
China
not
from
China
And
you
thought
Nixon
opened
up
China
Getting
back
specifically
to
the
tax
reductions
this
web
site
offers
a
lot
The
Tax
History
Museum
From
reading
the
site
it
appears
a
progressive
tax
system
was
put
in
place
for
the
WW
I
war
effort
They
even
put
in
a
munitions
tax
to
appease
opponents
of
American
involvement
in
the
war
levied
on
manufacturers
of
military
equipment
it
was
designed
to
prevent
war
profiteering
There
was
an
excess
profits
tax
put
in
place
which
appears
to
be
what
the
later
progressive
income
tax
became
Arguments
for
it
were
as
today
equality
Against
it
It
attracted
bitter
opposition
from
business
groups
who
considered
the
tax
a
threat
to
managerial
prerogatives
They
were
certainly
justified
in
their
suspicion
since
both
Wilson
and
his
allies
in
Congress
considered
the
levy
a
legitimate
means
of
business
regulation
Well
slap
me
silly
A
tax
used
to
curb
the
excess
of
business
I
hear
some
of
you
saying
Excessive
CEO
compensation
regulation
please
After
the
war
the
argument
was
that
such
high
rates
were
unsustainable
It
was
the
party
of
today's
tax
cuts
who
yesterday
cut
the
taxes
Republican
lawmakers
joined
with
a
series
of
GOP
presidents
to
engineer
tax
cuts
in
1921
1924
1926
and
1928
Andrew
Mellon
who
moved
into
his
Treasury
office
in
1921
and
stayed
their
until
1932
was
the
principal
architect
of
these
reforms
Certainly
some
Democratic
elected
joined
in
early
Blue
Dogs
DLC's
of
their
time
In
1980
we
got
schooled
in
the
Stockman
trickle
down
theory
of
economic
growth
which
included
lower
taxes
will
raise
collections
and
bolsters
economic
growth
It
was
all
about
cutting
taxes
by
his
confession
though
So
as
I
look
to
find
evidence
of
selling
tax
cuts
as
a
part
of
an
ideology
sell
job
regarding
how
an
economy
should
run
such
being
clues
that
in
the
near
future
we
will
have
economic
crap
the
following
regarding
Mr
Mellon's
position
just
confirms
how
ignorant
we
have
been
in
our
recent
times
post
1981
to
have
followed
those
who
suggest
tax
cuts
as
part
of
their
economic
program
Any
man
of
energy
and
initiative
in
this
country
can
get
what
he
wants
out
of
life
he
wrote
But
when
initiative
is
crippled
by
legislation
or
by
a
tax
system
which
denies
him
the
right
to
receive
a
reasonable
share
of
his
earnings
then
he
will
no
longer
exert
himself
and
the
country
will
be
deprived
of
the
energy
on
which
its
continued
greatness
depends
Worse
yet
Mellon
argued
high
rates
didn't
even
raise
money
By
encouraging
both
legal
tax
avoidance
and
illegal
tax
evasion
they
eroded
the
tax
base
and
reduced
overall
revenue
Lower
rates
he
said
would
actually
raise
money
by
spurring
economic
growth
and
reducing
the
incentive
for
tax
avoidance
It
seems
difficult
for
some
to
understand
he
complained
that
high
rates
of
taxation
do
not
necessarily
mean
large
revenue
to
the
government
and
that
more
revenue
may
actually
be
obtained
by
lower
rates
Can
we
have
been
any
more
stupid
shown
our
ignorance
more
than
to
have
taken
as
a
new
idea
language
regarding
taxation's
need
to
be
reduced
and
it's
effect
on
filling
the
government
coffers
that
is
as
old
as
almost
the
day
progressive
taxation
came
into
existence
Unfortunately
our
stupidity
has
been
worse
than
accepting
Mr
Mellon's
similar
arguments
to
those
used
by
Reagan
et
al
suggests
That
is
because
back
in
Mr
Mellon's
day
he
at
least
understood
what
Mr
Buffet
of
today
understands
but
congress
and
by
extension
US
do
not
Of
particular
note
he
suggested
taxing
earned
income
from
wages
and
salaries
more
lightly
that
unearned
income
from
investments
As
he
argued
The
fairness
of
taxing
more
lightly
income
from
wages
salaries
or
from
investments
is
beyond
question
In
the
first
case
the
income
is
uncertain
and
limited
in
duration
sickness
or
death
destroys
it
and
old
age
diminishes
it
in
the
other
the
source
of
income
continues
the
income
may
be
disposed
of
during
a
man's
life
and
it
descends
to
his
heirs
Surely
we
can
afford
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
people
whose
only
capital
is
their
metal
and
physical
energy
and
the
people
whose
income
is
derived
from
investments
Such
a
distinction
would
mean
much
to
millions
of
American
workers
and
would
be
an
added
inspiration
to
the
man
who
must
provide
a
competence
during
his
few
productive
years
to
care
for
himself
and
his
family
when
his
earnings
capacity
is
at
an
end
Again
I
ask
HOW
MANY
TIMES
DO
WE
HAVE
TO
DO
THIS
HOW
MANY
FREAKIN
TIMES
DO
WE
HAVE
TO
LEARN
THE
LESSON

Bank
Lending
growth
is
not
evidence
that
there
is
no
crises
By
Spencer
I
just
posted
this
in
the
comments
at
Marginal
Revolution
to
explain
why
the
view
that
expanding
bank
lending
demonstrates
that
their
is
no
crises
is
incorrect
By
looking
at
bank
lending
you
are
looking
at
the
wrong
side
of
the
bank's
balance
sheet
The
point
that
bank
lending
is
expanding
is
not
a
sign
that
their
is
no
credit
crunch
Rather
it
is
an
indicator
that
the
Fed
actions
over
the
last
year
to
provide
large
scale
financing
to
the
banking
system
is
working
The
crises
is
not
on
the
asset
side
of
the
banks
balance
sheet
Rather
it
is
in
the
liability
side
of
the
balance
sheet
where
they
raise
the
funds
to
finance
their
loans
and/or
investment
To
keep
it
simple
this
consist
of
three
items.One
is
deposits
Two
is
borrowing
in
the
money
markets
Three
is
borrowing
from
the
Fed
The
crises
has
been
the
contraction
in
the
banks
ability
to
borrow
in
the
money
markets
as
evidence
by
the
drop
in
financial
commercial
paper
and
other
short
term
instruments
Everything
the
Fed
has
done
over
the
last
year
to
provide
special
financing
to
the
banks
has
been
to
offset
or
counterbalance
the
banks
inability
to
funds
their
operations
in
the
money
markets
The
fact
that
bank
lending
is
still
rising
demonstrates
the
success
of
the
Fed
undertaking
its
lender
of
last
resort
So
again
the
growth
in
bank
lending
does
not
demonstrate
that
their
has
been
no
crises
Rather
it
demonstrates
the
Fed
success
in
dealing
with
the
crises
Why
are
firms
borrowing
One
of
course
is
to
draw
on
lines
of
credit
to
offset
their
inability
to
raise
funds
in
the
money
market
The
second
goes
to
the
point
that
bank
credit
is
a
lagging
indicator
In
the
early
stages
of
a
business
downturn
business
credit
demands
typically
surges
This
stems
from
the
point
that
their
normal
source
of
a
positive
cash
flow
sales
are
drying
up
as
demand
contracts
But
because
sales
are
contracting
they
have
to
finance
an
unusual
surge
in
unwanted
inventories
and
their
normal
day
to
day
expenses
such
as
payroll
Until
firms
can
dispose
of
their
unwanted
inventories
and
cut
expenses
they
have
to
expand
their
use
of
credit
This
is
why
credit
demand
normally
expand
sharply
in
the
early
stages
of
a
business
downturn
and
why
bank
lending
is
typically
a
lagging
indicator
This
typical
early
business
cycle
behavior
is
exactly
what
we
are
now
seeing
This
did
not
happen
in
the
last
cycle
because
it
was
not
a
typical
cycle
It
was
caused
by
a
collapse
in
capital
spending
not
by
a
contraction
of
consumer
spending
as
we
are
now
seeing

Draining
the
401k
pool
of
money

A
quick
search
on
401ks
in
response
to
reader
Noni
Mausa
Via
Money
Central
Financially
stretched
workers
are
increasingly
breaking
into
their
retirement
accounts
to
get
cash
Over
the
past
couple
of
decades
the
401(k
account
and
its
brethren
have
become
the
main
retirement
savings
vehicles
for
millions
of
Americans
But
as
the
credit
crunch
and
declining
home
values
limit
many
types
of
consumer
loans
a
growing
number
of
workers
are
tapping
into
these
accounts
as
if
they
were
piggy
banks
Eighteen
percent
of
workers
had
loans
outstanding
from
their
retirement
plans
in
2007
up
from
11
in
2006
according
to
a
survey
by
the
Transamerica
Center
for
Retirement
Studies
a
nonprofit
corporation
funded
by
Transamerica
Life
Insurance
Major
retirement
plan
providers
are
reporting
a
similar
trend
The
number
of
participants
taking
loans
from
their
401(k
plans
rose
by
7
at
the
end
of
last
year
from
six
months
earlier
according
to
a
JPMorgan
Chase
analysis
of
350
plans
nationwide
that
cover
1.3
million
people
Those
results
followed
a
period
from
January
2005
through
June
2007
when
loans
from
these
401(k
plans
fell
by
15
Similarly
in
2007
401(k
plans
administered
by
Fidelity
Investments
and
T
Rowe
Price
Group
posted
increases
in
loans
and
so-called
hardship
withdrawals
for
people
who
demonstrated
immediate
financial
needs
such
as
medical
expenses
over
the
prior
year
In
all
there
was
roughly
49
billion
of
401(k
loans
outstanding
at
the
end
of
2006
according
to
an
estimate
by
the
Employee
Benefit
Research
Institute
a
nonprofit
research
group
in
Washington
D.C
Trend
is
alarming
For
workers
a
retirement
plan
loan
may
seem
like
a
quick
and
easy
solution
to
a
cash
crunch
Borrowers
don't
need
good
credit
ratings
interest
rates
are
generally
relatively
low
and
interest
is
paid
to
the
borrowers
accounts
not
to
banks
But
the
rise
in
retirement
plan
loans
is
an
alarming
trend
says
Catherine
Collinson
the
president
of
the
Transamerica
Center
for
Retirement
Studies
The
real
secret
of
building
a
retirement
nest
egg
is
saving
over
the
long
term
on
a
consistent
basis
she
says
Hitting
up
your
retirement
account
for
cash
throws
a
wrench
into
this
process
There
are
other
reasons
why
borrowing
from
your
401(k
can
wreak
havoc
on
your
finances
A
worker
who
leaves
a
job
before
a
loan
is
paid
off
will
have
to
pay
the
remaining
balance
in
full
or
else
face
taxes
and
potential
penalties
What's
more
given
the
stock
market's
recent
declines
participants
now
borrowing
from
plans
may
be
selling
assets
at
depressed
values
to
fund
the
withdrawals
Link
to
foreclosures
seen
Why
the
surge
in
401(k
loans
Until
recently
soaring
home
prices
made
it
easy
for
consumers
to
tap
their
home
equity
for
funds
But
now
that
home
prices
are
dropping
rapidly
in
many
markets
more
workers
loaded
with
debt
and
struggling
to
make
mortgage
payments
are
turning
to
their
retirement
plans
Talk
back
What
is
your
retirement
target
number
In
the
Transamerica
study
which
surveyed
more
than
2,000
full-time
employees
at
for-profit
companies
49
of
those
who
borrowed
from
their
retirement
savings
said
they
had
taken
the
loans
to
pay
off
debts
up
from
27
in
2006
In
some
instances
workers
in
fear
of
home
foreclosure
may
be
tapping
retirement
funds
as
a
last-ditch
measure

You
Can
Lead

Water
but
You
can't
make
him
think
or
own
to
loan
Krugman
notes
L]ast
week
Joe
Nocera
of
The
Times
pointed
out
a
key
weakness
in
the
U.S
Treasury's
bank
rescue
plan
it
contains
no
safeguards
against
the
possibility
that
banks
will
simply
sit
on
the
money
Unlike
the
British
government
which
is
mandating
lending
requirements
in
return
for
capital
injections
our
government
seems
afraid
to
do
anything
except
plead
And
sure
enough
the
banks
seem
to
be
hoarding
the
cash
Events
have
forced
Mr
Paulson
into
a
partial
nationalization
of
the
financial
system
but
he
refuses
to
use
the
power
that
comes
with
ownership
link
added
So
that
700
billion
was
the
kleptocratic
c.f
Main
Street
suspected
it
was
and
which
Wall
Street
has
known
at
least
since
Ms
Smith
Listened
in
on
Washington
And
that
just
means
it
will
be
longer
and
worse
But
Jamie
Dimon
will
be
richer
at
the
end
so
all
is
well
in
Paulsonland
UPDATE
Peter
Dorman
at
Econospeak
was
all
over
the
Nocera
piece
the
day
before
I
saw
it
And
his
reading
naturally
is
classier
than
mine
You
can
lead
a
bank
to
liquidity
but
you
can't
make
it
loan
but
the
description
is
pretty
much
the
same
It
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
Paulson
has
a
plan
for
his
friends
in
the
financial
world
but
there
is
no
plan
for
the
economy
The
United
States
can't
wait
