Kurds
being
sucker-punched
again
As
an
American
as
a
Muslim
and
as
a
wife
and
mother
of
a
Kurd...This
war
is
affecting
me
more
and
more
each
day
Recently
there
were
some
beheadings
that
troubled
me
more
than
others...not
really
because
of
who
was
beheaded
but
rather
our
media's
and
our
administrations
reaction
to
them
While
the
beheading
of
Americans
and
of
other
westerners
are
top
news
stories...the
beheading
of
members
of
one
of
our
greatest
allies
in
that
region
the
Kurdish
Democratic
Party
didn't
even
make
the
headlines
I
will
explain
to
you
why
this
bothers
me
so
much
We
suppossedly
are
trying
to
send
out
the
message
that
we
are
trying
to
help
establish
and
guide
the
establishment
of
a
democatic
government
to
that
region
Well
one
of
our
most
key
allies
in
Iraq
have
been
the
Kurds
who
supported
us
before
during
and
after
the
Saddam
regime
This
support
dispite
us
several
times
not
fulfilling
promises
to
them
Are
they
suckers
We
have
not
stood
by
this
ally
in
my
opinion
as
much
as
we
should
Instead
we
use
their
cause
and
their
misfortunes
for
our
political
advantage
For
example
when
the
idea
of
a
war
with
Iraq
was
first
being
propogated
our
President
and
its
administration
had
the
audacity
to
use
Saddam's
gassing
of
the
Kurds
as
a
proof
of
the
threat
Saddam
was
to
the
world
Well
where
was
Bush
Sr
and
his
administration
when
my
husband's
village
was
gassed
resulting
in
the
deaths
of
his
parents
and
his
older
brother
Sipping
tea
with
Saddam
in
Baghdad
no
doubt
And
where
is
the
current
Bush
administration
when
members
of
the
KDP
are
being
beheaded
for
no
other
reason
than
their
standing
up
for
democracy
and
their
alliance
with
us
We
are
heading
down
a
dangerous
road
right
now
where
turning
back
may
not
be
an
option
Is
it
really
wise
for
us
to
alienate
those
who
have
supported
us
even
after
we
have
repeatedly
sucker-punched
them
I
have
no
doubt
that
ridding
Iraq
of
Saddam
was
a
good
thing
He
was
the
cause
of
my
kids
having
no
grandparents
so
you
see
it
is
personal
for
me
But
make
no
mistake
our
administration
had
better
own
up
to
its
mistakes
in
this
war
going
under
false
pretenses
not
pulling
out
when
we
should
have
not
having
a
well-thought
out
and
insightful
policy
on
Iraq...If
they
don't
they
will
lose
all
allies
lose
more
troops
and
sooner
or
later
the
people
of
America
will
wise
up
and
demand
that
the
administration
be
held
accountable
with
what
history
could
record
as
a
grave
political
blunder
if
policies
do
not
change
soon

Option
Four
Even
after
the
elections
we
maintain
a
presence
in
Iraq
from
which
we
interject
ourselves
into
the
Middle
Eastern
equation
A
modified
but
active
base
is
established
and
supported
by
the
35
reduction
of
foreign
bases
elsewhere
in
the
world
recently
announced
From
this
particular
base
military
options
are
available
to
us
and
there
is
a
local
area
into
which
intelligence
can
be
brought
Any
actions
that
need
to
be
taken
on
al
Qaida
or
regimes
that
support
it
would
be
facilitated
by
it's
proximity
to
them
If
the
war
is
against
al
Qaida
as
we
say
it
is
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
have
a
central
location
from
which
to
strike
at
a
moment's
notice
established
within
the
milieu
of
the
Middle
East
itself
The
reasoning
could
go
Afghanistan
was
more
of
a
success
than
it
is
given
credit
for
being
A
constitutional
convention
was
convened
and
a
new
constitution
and
electoral
procedure
is
not
only
in
place
but
looks
to
be
progessing
toward
the
declared
send-off
dates
Al
Qaida
and
the
Taliban
are
truly
marginalized
there
and
in
fact
the
main
security
concern
are
the
warlords
still
in
place
more
than
anything
else
If
nothing
else
the
action
in
Iraq
removed
a
state
that
still
considered
itself
at
war
with
the
United
States
and
was
in
the
process
of
training
it's
own
terrorists
whether
or
not
they
were
officially
linked
to
al
Qaida
beyond
the
already
documented
non-aggression
pact
they
shared
The
removal
of
a
government
that
had
previously
showed
no
qualms
about
using
weapons
to
directly
target
civilians
was
a
positive
factor
in
the
entire
region
and
the
presence
of
American
force
and
potential
in
this
region
can
only
act
as
a
sobering
factor
on
regimes
that
have
supported
terrorists
in
the
past
and
regimes
that
have
the
potential
for
the
Islamic
bomb
That
this
base
may
be
a
target
of
the
anti-American
jihadists
is
actually
a
benefit
as
it
actually
makes
the
front
line
against
terror
thousands
of
miles
away
from
American
soil
and
forces
those
who
would
do
harm
to
America
to
focus
on
something
that
is
near
to
them
Why
is
this
or
is
this
not
a
viable
outline

Pax
Americana
Nick
The
extent
of
our
military
might
is
so
obvious
a
fact
that
it
need
not
be
re-emphasized
America
is
often
referred
to
us
as
The
American
Empire
a
metaphor
which
deserves
neither
nationalistic
embrace
nor
rejection
by
denial
Rather
we
are
warranted
to
draw
historical
parallels
with
the
fallen
empires
of
past
and
the
Pax
Americana
of
today
America's
current
situation
is
most
commonly
paralleled
to
that
of
the
Roman
empire
However
the
parallel
is
insufficient
The
Roman
empire
was
built
by
legions
who
slaughtered
their
way
to
world
power
In
the
process
they
suffered
catastrophic
defeats
at
the
hands
of
the
Gauls
Persians
Carthaginians
and
numerous
other
Germanic
tribes
The
grand
legions
fell
in
clashes
with
rival
dictators
and
massive
revolts
the
humiliated
citizens
of
their
occupations
The
United
States
hasn't
suffered
comparable
defeats
since
the
Korean
War
It
also
bears
mentioning
that
the
Legions
owned
their
allegiance
not
to
Rome
or
the
Emperor
but
to
their
leaders
and
fellow
troops
Thus
while
Rome
did
dominate
the
world
it
did
so
without
the
military
superiority
or
discipline
of
the
United
States
at
present
The
other
common
parallel
is
that
of
the
British
Empire
during
the
late
19th
century
Unlike
the
Romans
the
British
had
a
relatively
small
army
Bismarck
once
joked
that
if
the
British
army
landed
on
the
Baltic
coast
he'd
send
the
Berlin
Police
to
arrest
them
The
British
Empire
was
mostly
sustained
by
their
legendary
navy
However
the
huge
mass
of
ships
in
the
royal
navy
became
increasingly
obsolete
The
Ironclad
was
introduced
into
the
French
Navy
well
before
the
British
caught
up
Even
when
the
British
introduced
the
revolutionary
Dreadnought
battleships
the
superior
industrial
power
of
the
Americans
and
Germans
closed
the
gap
of
sea
power
within
a
blink
of
an
eye
Historically
the
strength
of
the
United
States
military
is
without
parallel
Our
military
budget
accounts
for
50
of
the
overall
international
expenditures
on
defense
Within
the
annals
of
military
history
the
US
is
the
only
country
to
enjoy
superiority
in
all
spheres
of
warfare
land
sea
air
and
space
No
other
country's
military
can
compare
to
our
technological
sophistication
Not
a
single
country
can
compete
with
the
US's
capability
to
move
large
forces
within
short
periods
of
time
to
any
part
of
the
globe
In
short
the
legions
of
the
United
States
have
no
match
and
the
gap
between
them
and
other
militarize
is
only
growing
Perhaps
the
biggest
military
blunder
in
recent
history
was
Vietnam
However
the
damage
of
Vietnam
is
not
comparable
to
that
of
Disraeli's
regiments
at
Isandhlwana
or
Augustus's
legions
in
the
Teutoburger
Wald
In
the
end
its
not
the
terminology
of
Empire
that
matters
rather
its
America's
overwhelming
military
dominance
For
now
no
international
coalition
could
be
capable
of
blocking
it
let
alone
willing
to
replace
it
Our
strength
lies
in
our
remarkably
stable
economy
and
political
system
and
our
growing
and
extraordinarily
productive
workforce
The
fact
is
that
no
president
will
call
for
a
major
reduction
in
defense
spending
in
the
next
decade
or
deny
that
we
must
have
the
strongest
military
in
the
world
ready
to
exert
its
power
at
any
point
the
world
unilaterally
The
United
States
has
much
less
choice
in
world
affairs
than
the
pacifists
or
foreign
critics
would
like
to
believe
Despite
the
wishes
of
the
French
no
coalition
is
likely
to
form
that
will
counter-weight
US
strength
and
restore
a
military
balance
similar
to
post-Napoleonic
Europe
Contrary
to
the
wishes
of
idealists
the
UN
has
proven
incapable
of
maintaining
global
order
without
the
military
diplomatic
and
financial
support
of
the
US
Lastly
if
the
pacifists
had
their
way
and
we
became
isolationists
with
a
mediocre
military
the
result
would
be
International
anarchy
rampant
totalitarianism
and
mass-bloodshed
all
of
which
is
too
horrifying
to
contemplate
In
the
end
our
real
choice
is
to
exercise
our
power
foolishly
or
prudently
safely
or
dangerously
In
the
case
of
Iraq
we
excercised
our
power
foolishly
and
dangerously
Our
military
is
a
mighty
machine
but
even
now
is
showing
signs
of
fatigue
and
ware
Had
we
not
invaded
Iraq
we
would
have
ended
a
genocide
in
Sudan
by
now
which
would
have
been
an
example
of
wise
use
of
military
force
However
we've
over-stretched
ourselves
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
and
our
European
allies
have
shown
complete
denial
and
apathy
towards
the
situation
If
anything
is
clear
regarding
the
future
international
order
its
that
Europe
will
continue
to
behave
much
as
they
did
at
the
Munich
Conference
of
1938
and
delude
themselves
into
thinking
that
the
temporary
lack
of
war
is
peace
As
for
America
it
rests
in
the
hands
of
the
people
to
elect
a
president
who
will
continue
to
make
the
world
safer
Judging
from
Bush's
first
term
he
will
not
be
that
man
