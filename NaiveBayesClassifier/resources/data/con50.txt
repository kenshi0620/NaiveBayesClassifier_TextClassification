John
and
I
have
a
column
supporting
John
McCain
for
president
that
is
forthcoming
in
Monday's
Christian
Science
Monitor
Working
on
the
column
it
occurred
to
me
that
McCain
would
fit
relatively
comfortably
in
the
Democratic
Party
of
JFK
which
lives
on
today
if
at
all
in
the
lonely
personage
of
Senator
McCain's
friend
and
suporter
Joe
Lieberman
McCain
himself
seems
to
me
beautifully
captured
in
the
almost
Churchillian
quote
from
JFK's
inaugural
with
which
we
conclude
our
column
JFK
described
himself
as
the
representative
of
a
generation
tempered
by
war
disciplined
by
a
hard
and
bitter
peace
proud
of
our
ancient
heritage--and
unwilling
to
witness
or
permit
the
slow
undoing
of
those
human
rights
to
which
this
Nation
has
always
been
committed

which
we
are
committed

Zeituni
Onyango
the

so
affectionately
described
in
Mr

best-selling
memoir
Dreams

My

lives
in
a

on
a

Boston
A

was
beaten
by
armed
robbers
with
a
sawed-off
rifle
while
working
in
a
corner
shop
in
the

of

city
He
was
later
evicted
from
his
one-bedroom
flat
for
failing
to
pay
2,324.20
1,488
arrears
according
to
the
Boston
Housing

Funny
how
you
have
to
go
to
the
British
papers
in
this
case
the
London
Times
for
this
kind
of
story
Bob
Krumm
emails
The
most
damning
part
of
the
Obama
aunt
story
is
that
once
his
campaign
found
her
living
in
squalor
they
told
her
to
not
talk
to
the
press
until
after
the
election
but
they
didn't
try
to
help
her
He
has
a
post
here
to
that
effect
Some
thoughts
from
TigerHawk
I
have
finally
figured
out
why
somebody
who
has
been
as
successful
as
Barack
Obama
believes
that
the
government
must
help
people
who
cannot
or
do
not
help
themselves
He
simply
does
not
understand
that
helping
the
poor
unlucky
or
incompetent
is
first
the
responsibility
of
family
Plus
this
He
has
used
these
people
his
grandmother
his
aunt
and
uncle
and
so
forth
as
props
in
his
political
narrative
He
wants
us
to
measure
him
in
part
by
his
relationship
to
these
Kenyans
but
and
here
is
the
harsh
part
only
as
that
relationship
is
described
by
him
What
if
his
characterization
of
that
relationship
is
misleading
What
if
it
turns
out
that
while
he
is
delighted
to
cite
these
people
as
evidence
of
his
humble
beginnings
that
is
what
I
mean
by
using
them
as
props
he
is
not
so
delighted
to
consider
them
as
part
of
his
family
Is
that
not
at
least
a
potentially
useful
insight
into
the
character
of
this
man
about
whom
we
know
so
little
Ann
Althouse
defends
Obama
and
quotes
the
Bible
At
NRO's
Corner
Mark
Steyn
opened
yet
another
window
on
the
story
a
window
with
a
view
to
Obama's
dubious
donations
The
London
Times
story
of
Barack
Obama's
Aunt
Zeituni
like
that
of
his
penniless
brother
and
the
Kenyan
grade
school
he
promised
to
help
is
interesting
not
only
as
a
reflection
on
the
candidate's
belief
that
spreading
the
wealth
around
is
a
centralized
government
mandate
to
be
imposed
on
Joe
the
Plumber
rather
than
a
personal
act
by
say
a
wealthy
memoirist
whose
books
repackage
colorful
relatives
to
highly
lucrative
effect
But
aside
from
all
that
this
detail
is
lovely
The
Times
could
not
determine
their
immigration
status
and
an
official
at
Boston
City
Hall
said
that
Ms
Onyango
was
a
resident
of
Flaherty
Way
but
not
registered
to
vote
on
the
electoral
roll
However
that
Ms
Onyango
made
a
contribution
to
the
Obama
campaign
would
indicate
that
she
is
a
US
citizen
Of
course
By
definition
if
you
donate
to
Barack
the
Good
you
must
be
one
of
his
loyal
subjects
They
should
make
it
a
requirement
of
the
citizenship
test
By
the
way
the
argument
that
giving
money
to
Obama
is
ipso
facto
proof
of
citizenship
also
clears
up
any
question
marks
over
those
donations
by
A
Hitler
and
S
Hussein
Congratulations
Mark
adds

closing
thought
Oh
and
if
you
want
to
know
why
The
Boston
Globe's
parent
company
The
New
York
Times
has
been
downgraded
by
Moody's
to
junk
status
ask
yourself
why
this

is

a
foreign

three
thousand
miles
away
rather
than
the
local

UDPATE

After
Barack
Obama
clinched
the
Democratic
presidential
nomination
this
past
June
I
set
out
a
comparison
between
Minnesota
Fifth
District
Rep
Keith
Ellison
and
Barack
Obama
Minnesota's
Fifth
District
covers
Minneapolis
and
its
inner-ring
suburbs
I
think
the
comparison
remains
both
valid
and
illuminating
I
am
taking
the
liberty
of
revisiting
my
argument
this
morning
Watching
the
emergence
of
Barack
Obama
this
year
I
have
experienced
at
least
a
slight
sense
of
déj
vu
With
modifications
and
variations
the
Obama
phenomenon
was
anticipated
by
the
rise
of
Keith
Ellison
in
2006
I
didn't
know
anything
about
Ellison
when
he
won
the
endorsement
of
the
DFL
Democratic
Fifth
District
convention
in
May
2006
The
endorsement
kicked
off
a
competitive
four-way
primary
battle
that
Ellison
won
with
a
plurality
of
the
vote
in
September
2006
Minneapolis
and
the
Fifth
District
being
one-party
territory
Ellison's
primary
win
guaranteed
Ellison's
election
to
Congress
in
November
2006
After
I
first
posted
an
item
or
two
about
Ellison
in
June
on
Power
Line
writing
about
him
as
carefully
as
I
could
I
started
getting
calls
from
prominent
Democrats
and
other
knowledgeable
sources
with
first-hand
knowledge
of
Ellison
They
were
unhappy
at
the
thought
that
Keith
Ellison
might
become
the
face
of
the
Democratic
Party
in
Minnesota's
largest
city
With
a
competitive
Democratic
primary
for
the
Fifth
District
endorsement
the
information
provided
by
these
sources
proved
to
be
of
interest
to
many
Fifth
District
Democrats
Given
Ellison's
status
as
the
first
black
congressional
nominee
in
Minnesota
and
first
Muslim
congressional
nominee
in
the
United
States
the
constraints
of
political
correctness
drastically
inhibited
the
Minneapolis
Star
Tribune's
coverage
of
Ellison
Indeed
it
was
frustration
with
the
Star
Tribune's
coverage
of
the
race
and
noncoverage
of
Ellison's
past
that
provided
the
impetus
for
prominent
local
Democrats
and
others
who
approached
me
with
information
about
Ellison
They
helped
me
kick
off
a
series
of
Power
Line
posts
on
Ellison
that
I
summarized
in
the
October
2006
Weekly
Standard
article
Louis
Farrakhan's
first
Congressman
and
the
companion
Power
Line
post
Keith
Ellison
for
dummies
Here
I
want
to
draw
a
few
comparisons
between
Ellison
and
Obama
in
somewhat
summary
but
I
hope
suggestive
fashion
From
the
time
of
Ellison's
first
published
article
in
the
University
of
Minnesota
Daily
in
1989
under
the
name
Keith
Hakim
through
the
time
he
first
ran
for
public
office
ten
years
later
under
the
name
Keith
Ellison-Muhammad
unsuccessfully
seeking
the
Democratic
endorsement
for
a
state
legislative
seat
Ellison
was
a
self-avowed
advocate
of
the
Nation
of
Islam
Ellison's
self-identification
as
a
member
and
leader
of
the
Nation
of
Islam
remained
one
of
the
deep
secrets
of
his
2006
campaign
Both
Ellison
and
Obama
attended
Louis
Farrakhan's
1995
Million
Man
March
In
Ellison's
case
attendance
came
in
the
heyday
of
his
involvement
with
the
Nation
of
Islam
For
Obama
attendance
appears
to
have
been
an
act
of
racial
solidarity
In
Obama's
eyes
Farrakhan
himself
was
retrograde
In
Dreams
From
My
Father
Obama
meditates
on
Farrakhan
finding
If
black
nationalism
could
create
a
strong
and
effective
insularity
deliver
on
its
promise
of
self-respect
then
the
hurt
it
might
cause
well-meaning
whites
or
the
inner
turmoil
it
caused
people
like
me
would
be
of
little
consequence
As
Steve
Sailer
notes
Obama
dispassionately
rejected
Black
Nationalism
as
economically
and
politically
impractical
In
Sailer's
words
Obama
concluded
that
the
Black
Muslims
are
losers
and
Obama
with
his
two
Ivy
League
degrees
and
boundless
ambition
is
a
winner
Obama
nevertheless
found
the
functional
equivalent
of
Farrakhan
in
Jeremiah
Wright
Wright
had
no
such
reservations
regarding
Farrakhan
He
has
an
enduring
relationship
with
Farrakhan
that
goes
back
at
least
as
far
as
their
joint
trip
to
visit
Col
Gadaffi
in
1984
In
casting
his
lot
with
Wright's
Trinity
United
Church
of
Christ
Obama
found
the
useful
Christian
analogue
of
the
Nation
of
Islam
Ellison
abandoned
his
affiliation
with
the
Nation
of
Islam
after
he
unsuccessfully
sought
the
Democratic
endorsement
for
a
state
legislative
seat
as
a
self-identified
member
of
the
Nation
of
Islam
running
under
the
name
Keith
Ellison-Muhammad
in
1998
In
2002
as
a
Muslim
Ellison
won
the
Democratic
endorsement
for
the
legislative
seat
minus
the
Muhammad
This
year
after
avowing
his
allegiance
to
Wright
in
a
celebrated
speech
Obama
famously
cast
aside
Wright
and
Trinity
United
Church
under
pressure
late
in
the
primary
season
In
seeking
their
respective
nominations
both
Ellison
and
Obama
found
support
among
Hamas
and
friends
The
Hamas-related
support
for
Ellison
and
Obama
is
indicative
of
the
melding
of
the
left
with
Islamist
forces
at
home
and
abroad
It
is
an
alliance
that
Ellison
embodies
As
Joel
Mowbray
reported
on
Power
Line
in
Ellison's
case
the
support
came
in
bundled
contributions
from
CAIR
executive
director
Nihad
Awad
Awad
headlined
an
August
2006
fundraiser
for
Ellison
that
netted
15,000
to
20,000
Awad
also
bundled
contributions
totaling
just
over
10,000
CAIR
is
the
Hamas
front
group
that
was
named
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
in
the
government's
prosecution
of
the
Holy
Land
Foundation
The
Ellison
campaign
issued
a
terse
denial
regarding
Awad's
bundling
of
contributions
to
Ellison
though
it
refused
to
explain
away
overwhelming
evidence
to
the
contrary
The
Minneapolis
Star
Tribune
did
not
get
around
to
reporting
on
the
Ellison
fundraiser
featuring
Awad
until
after
the
Democratic
primary
the
following
month
Hamas
itself
has
expressed
support
for
Obama
Hamas
spokesman
Ahmed
Yousef
expressed
Hamas's
support
for
Obama
in
April
of
this
year
Al
Jazeera
reported
an
even
more
striking
expression
of
support
for
Obama
from
the
Hamas-controlled
Gaza
Strip
According
to
Al
Jazeera
Obama
supporters
operated
a
phone
bank
supporting
Obama
in
the
primaries
out
of
an
Internet
cafe
in
the
Gaza
Strip
Like
Ellison's
relationship
with
CAIR
Hamas's
support
for
Obama
has
received
little
interest
from
the
mainstream
media
Both
Ellison
and
Obama
have
friends
among
home-grown
terrorists
Ellison
was
a
vocal
supporter
of
Kathleen
Soliah/Sara
Jane
Olson
the
former
Symbionese
Liberation
member
who
was
apprehended
in
St
Paul
in
June
1999
We
reported
Ellison's
support
for
Olson
here
and
here
Olson
ultimately
pled
guilty
to
two
counts
of
possessing
explosives
with
intent
to
murder
Los
Angeles
police
officers
in
1975
and
to
the
murder
of
Myrna
Opsahl
in
the
Crocker
National
Bank
robbery
the
same
year
By
the
same
token
Obama's
friends
in
Chicago
include
former
Weather
Underground
terrorists
William
Ayers
and
Bernardine
Dohrn
We
discussed
Obama's
friendship
with
Ayers
and
Dohrn
here
and
here
Ayers
and
Dohrn
spent
10
years
in
the
terrorist
group
that
bombed
the
Pentagon
the
Capitol
and
other
government
buildings
in
the
1970's
Finally
both
Ellison
and
Obama
were
the
leftward-most
viable
candidates
running
for
the
Democratic
Party
endorsement
and
both
won
endorsement
against
heirs
apparent
In
Ellison's
case
the
presumptive
nominee
was
Mike
Erlandson
Erlandson
was
the
chief
of
staff
of
14-term
incumbent
Martin
Sabo
and
he
was
Sabo's
handpicked
successor
At
the
Fifth
District
convention
in
May
2006
Ellison
presented
himself
as
the
serious
radical
alternative
to
Erlandson
Dennis
Kucinich's
counterpart
at
the
Fifth
District
convention
was
peace
activist
Jack
Nelson-Pallmeyer
Fifth
District
delegates
rejected
Erlandson
instead
choosing
to
take
the
plunge
with
Ellison
In
the
multicandidate
primary
that
followed
in
September
Ellison
won
with
41
percent
of
the
vote
Similar
dynamics
propelled
Obama
over
Hillary
Clinton
in
the
Democratic
primary
contest
Until
the
Iowa
caucus
she
was
the
prohibitive
frontrunner
and
heir
apparent
to
Bill
Clinton
Opting
for
a
candidate
untainted

Obama

on

proposition
that
he
was
the

on
the
issue
of

His

to

was

than
that
of
the
other

candidates
among
the

Democratic

His

at

of

proved
to
be
a
powerful
asset
against
Hillary

Despite
the
natural

that

between

scrupulously
avoided
Ellison
The
New

Times
reported
in

article
by
Andrea
Elliott
for
example
that
Ellison
had
volunteered
to
speak
on
Obama's
behalf
at
a
mosque
rally
in
Cedar
Rapids
presumably
before
the
Iowa
caucus
in
January
Prior
to
the
event
aides
to
Obama
asked
Ellison
to
cancel
the
trip
An
Obama
aide
appeared
at
Ellison's
Washington
office
to
explain
that
Obama
has
a
very
tightly
wrapped
message
The
clue
that
Keith

provides
to
the

of

Obama's
emergence
in
the
2008
campaign
is
akin

We've
been
writing
for
some
years
about
the
fact
that
America's
income
tax
system
has
increasingly
concentrated
tax
liability
among
the
highest
income
earners
Currently
the
top
ten
percent
of
American
income
earners
pay
71
percent
of
all
income
taxes
Our
excessively
progressive
tax
system
has
created
a
dangerous
situation
in
which
anyone
can
vote
for
politicians
who
promise
to
deliver
goodies
by
spreading
the
wealth
but
only
a
handful
are
responsible
for
paying
the
bills
Whether
a
democracy
can
survive
indefinitely
under
these
circumstances
is
an
open
question
A
new
report
by
the
Organization
for
Economic
Cooperation
and
Development
OECD
shows
how
extreme
the
progressivity
of
our
tax
system
has
become
The
U.S
has
the
most
progressive
tax
system
and
collects
the
largest
share
of
taxes
from
the
richest
10
of
the
population
That's
right
our
tax
system
is
more
progressive
than
Sweden's
More
The
table
also
shows
that
the
U.S
collects
more
household
tax
revenue
income
plus
social
security
taxes
from
the
top
10
percent
of
households
than
any
other
country
and
extracts
the
most
from
that
income
group
relative
to
their
share
of
the
nation's
income
Barack
Obama
and
the
Democratic
Congress
now
promise
to
exacerbate
the
unfairness
of
our
tax
system
by
concentrating
tax
liabilities
even
more
exclusively
among
high
income
earners
Apart
from
the
long-term
economic
consequences
of
such
a
policy
it
is
simply
unjust

David
Broder
writes
Because
McCain
could
not
create
a
coherent
philosophy
or
vision
of
his
own
he
allowed
Obama
and
the
Democrats
to
convince
voters
of
a
falsehood
that
electing
McCain
would
in
effect
reward
Bush
with
a
third
term
To
the
extent
that
Obama
convinced
voters
that
a
McCain
administration
would
approximate
a
third
term
of
President
Bush
he
succeeded
for
three
reasons
1
McCain
is
more
like
Bush
than
Obama
is
2
Obama
had
virtually
unlimited
resources
with
which
to
exaggerate
the
similarities
between
Bush
and
McCain
and
3
the
mainstream
media
assisted
Obama
by
playing
up
the
bogus
theme
that
McCain
had
changed
and
was
no
longer
a
maverick
What
philosophy
or
vision
was
McCain
supposed
to
forge
that
would
have
overcome
these
factors
Broder
doesn't
say
Calling
on
politicians
to
create
a
vision
without
suggesting
what
that
vision
might
be
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
gives
pundits
a
bad
name
Broder
thinks
McCain
was
hurt
by
his
one
from
column
A
one
from
column
B
my
phrase
approach
to
policy
making
He
finds
that
McCain's
Teddy
Roosevelt
era
progressivism
and
his
Reagan
era
conservatism
don't
co-exist
easily
But
one
could
more
plausibly
argue
that
the
combination
of
these
elements
is
what
has
kept
McCain
within
shouting
distance
of
Obama
Without
the
Reagan
element
McCain
would
have
lost
the
base
without
the
TR
element
he
would
be
doing
much
worse
among
moderates
and
independents
At
root
Obama
and
McCain
said
the
same
thing
this
year
which
isn't
surprising
inasmuch
as
good
politicians
are
good
because
they
figure
out
the
thing
that
needs
to
be
said
Both
argued
that
our
situation
has
gotten
worse
in
recent
years
and
both
argued
that
they
could
transcend
business-as-usual
partisan
politics
and
get
the
country
on
course
Obama
based
his
argument
on
his
personal
freshness
and
on
meaningless
claims
of
being
post-partisan
McCain
based
his
argument
on
his
past
history
of
reaching
across
the
aisle
and
of
taking
on
special
interests
McCain
had
the
better
case
but
as
a
Republican
and
under
constant
attack
from
the
mainstream
media
he
was
less
convincing
than
Obama
as
a
critic
of
the
status
quo
and
an
agent
of
change
There
probably
wasn't
anything
McCain
could
have
done
about
this
But
it's
in
the
interest
of
members
of
the
mainstream
to
develop
a
narrative
that
blames
McCain
if
he
loses
in
the
hope
that
disaffected
voters
won't
blame
the
MSM

Ed
Whelan
takes
a
look
at
the
consequences
of
an
Obama
victory
for
the
Supreme
Court
The
consequences
aren't
pretty
Some
conservatives
downplay
the
likely
impact
of
an
Obama
victory
noting
that
the
judges
he
is
most
likely
to
replace
are
liberal
devotees
of
a
living
Constitution
Whelan
has
several
responses
First
the
Court
needs
to
improve
and
can't
unless
McCain
wins
In
Whelan's
view
with
the
Court
as
it
is
now
constituted
there
may
very
well
be
five
votes
for
say
the
imposition
of
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
same-sex
marriage
five
votes
for
stripping
under
God
out
of
the
Pledge
of
Allegiance
and
for
complete
secularization
of
the
public
square
five
votes
for
continuing
to
abolish
the
death
penalty
on
the
installment
plan
five
votes
for
selectively
importing
into
the
Court's
interpretation
of
the
American
Constitution
the
favored
policies
of
Europe's
leftist
elites
five
votes
for
further
judicial
micromanagement
of
the
government's
war
powers
and
five
votes
for
the
invention
of
a
constitutional
right
to
human
cloning
Second
Obama
would
likely
nominate
and
the
Senate
confirm
Justices
well
to
the
left
of
the
current
crop
of
liberals
The
Left
sees
even
President
Clinton's
appointees
Ginsburg
and
Breyer
as
too
mild
and
moderate
Obama's
supporters
are
clamoring
for
liberal
lions
who
will
redefine
the
Constitution
as
a
left-wing
goodies
bag
and
a
look
at
some
of
their
leading
contenders
like
Yale
law
school
dean
Harold
Koh
champion
of
judicial
transnationalism
and
transgenderism
Massaschusetts
governor
Deval
Patrick
a
racialist
extremist
and
judicial
supremacist
and
law
professor
Cass
Sunstein
advocate
of
judicial
invention
of
a
second
Bill
of
Rights
on
welfare
employment
and
other
Nanny
State
mandates
shows
that
there
is
lots
of
room
for
Obama's
nominees
to
be
even
worse
than
Ginsburg
and
Breyer
Third
life
is
too
unpredictable
to
assume
that
Obama
won't
have
the
opportunity
in
his
first
term
to
replace
one
or
more
of
the
four
Justices
who
are
committed
to
judicial
restraint
Moreover
most
presidents
are
elected
to
serve
a
second
term
Ed
concludes
The
Court
urgently
needs
to
be
transformed
into
an
institution
that
practices
judicial
restraint
If
Barack
Obama
is
elected
president
he
will
drive
the
Court
further
in
the
wrong
direction
and
the
liberal
judicial
activists
that
he
appoints
will
likely
serve
for
two
or
three
decades
Our
system
of
representative
government
already
under
siege
would
be
lucky
to
survive
an
Obama
presidency
Some
may
think
that
the
last
sentence
goes
too
far
indeed
I
found
it
jarring
when
I
first
read
it
But
jarring
isn't
the
same
thing
as
wrong
and
I
think
Whelan
has
it
right
When
the
Supreme
Court
replaces
the
policies
enacted
by
elected
representatives
with
the
policies
they
prefer
and
this
is
done
without
a
serious
regard
for
the
language
of
the
Constitution
on
the
theory
that
the
Constitution
is
a
living
document
representative
government
is
by
definition
undermined
We've
already
started
down
that
path
Obama
might
well
take
us
the
rest
of
the
way

In
response
to
criticism
of
the
Washington
Post's
Anne
Applebaum
following
her
endorsement
of
Barack
Obama
David
Frum
asks
How
small
has
the
house
of
conservatism
shrunk
when
it
can
find
no
room
for
Anne
Applebaum
this
generation's
greatest
living
expert
on
the
crimes
of
communism
One
can
be
a
conservative
and
sit
this
election
out
though
that
would
be
a
bad
decision
One
can
also
be
a
conservative
and
vote
for
Bob
Barr
also
a
bad
decision
But
I
don't
see
how
one
can
be
a
conservative
as
that
term
is
currently
understood
in
common
political
discourse
and
vote
for
a
candidate
who
according
to
the
non-partisan
National
Journal
has
the
most
liberal
voting
record
in
the
Senate
An
Obama
administration
would
almost
certainly
be
to
the
left
of
the
Clinton
administration
It
might
well
be
to
the
left
of
any
U.S
administration
ever
A
person
who
votes
to
bring
on
that
administration
may
be
admirable
in
many
respects
He
or
she
may
have
been
a
conservative
recently
He
or
she
may
become
a
conservative
soon
and
should
be
welcome
in
that
event
But
if
the
term
conservative
is
given
its
ordinary
contemporary
meaning
how
can
he
or

be
considered
a

now

Diana
West
reports
on
the
harrowing
case
of
Bart
Debie
who
has
just
begun
serving
a
one-year
prison
sentence
for
racism
in
what
Diana
describes
as
fascistic
little
Belgium
If
her
account
of
Debie's
case
is
accurate
then
her
characterization
of
Belgium
is
not
far
wide
of
the
mark
Debie
was
a
senior
police
officer
in
Antwerp
in
2003
when
according
to
Diana's
account
he
and
several
other
officers
responded
to
a
report
of
drunk
and
disorderly
conduct
They
were
attacked
by
five
Turkish
men
wielding
a
baseball
bat
and
a
knife
two
witnesses
testified
in
court
that
this
attack
occurred
After
helping
to
subdue
and
arrest
the
attackers
Debie
was
called
away
to
supervise
a
SWAT
team
elsewhere
in
Antwerp
and
his
men
returned
to
the
station
with
the
Turkish
prisoners
The
prisoners
later
claimed
they
had
been
beaten
and
subjected
to
racism
while
at
the
station
Debie
believes
that
the
prisoners
were
in
fact
beaten
But
it
is
undisputed
that
he
was
not
involved
in
any
beating
or
racist
utterances
Nonetheless
Debie
was
charged
and
convicted
of
creating
an
atmosphere
in
which
the
offensive
statements
were
uttered
and
was
given
a
suspended
sentence
Meanwhile
the
policeman
who
admitted
to
making
the
racist
comments
went
unpunished
and
now
serves
according
to
Debie
on
a
team
for
managing
diversity
in
Antwerp
The
Turks
were
never
charged
for
their
assault
on
police
Debie
then
committed
his
real
offense
He
decided
to
decided
to
run
for
a
seat
on
the
Antwerp
city
council
as
a
member
of
the
Vlaams
Belang
party
To
make
matters
he
was
elected
Vlaams
Belang
seeks
Flemish
independence
from
Belgium
through
the
political
process
and
it
opposes
the
Islamization
of
European
culture
Consequently
it
is
hated
by
Belgium's
left-wing
establishment
which
as
Diana
observes
encourages
such
Islamization
in
part
to
help
increase
their
own
constituencies
After
Debie
became
a
political
force
the
prosecution
appealed
his
case
This
time
it
secured
a
racism
conviction
for
remarks
Debie
didn't
make
during
an
incident
at
which
he
was
not
present
In
addition
to
a
stiff
fine
and
a
prison
sentence
of
one
year
the
government
of
Belgium
has
stripped
him
of
his
political
and
civil
rights
for
12
years
locally
and
five
years
nationally
Debie
is
not
even
certain
if
he
can
proceed
with
his
marriage
plans
Debie
is
not
the
only
member
of
Vlaams
Belang
to
have
experienced
persecution
by
the
Belgian
government
Diana
reports
that
two
of
the
leading
members
of
the
party
Filip
Dewinter
and
Frank
Vanhecke
are
facing
legal
battles
of
their
own
to
retain
their
political
rights
and
viability
against
other
completely
bogus
charges
of
racism'--the
favored
bludgeon
of
PC
Belgians
desperate
to
retain
centralized
power
Democracy
and
political
freedom
are
fragile
things
though
we
in
the
United
States
have
not
yet
had
much
occasion
to
appreciate
this
reality
Based
on
my
understanding
of
the
situation
in
Belgium
which
is
based
in
part
on
conversations
with
members
of
Vlaams
Belang
though
not
Debie
Dewinter
or
Vanhecke
democracy
is
broken
in
there
and
quite
possibly
on
its
way
to
extinction
UPDATE
Diana
West
has
informed
me
that
Debie
was
released
from
jail
after
his
first
day
He
is
now
under
under
some
kind
of
an
electronic
surevillance/home
arrest
arrangement
Debie
remains
stripped
of
his
civil
and
political
rights
his
council
seat
and
his
police
career
But
at
least
he
doesn't
face
the
prospect
of
being
confronted
in
jail
by
what
he
calls
his
former
clients

Washington
Post
reporter
Matthew
Mosk
returned
to
the
subject
of
Barack
Obama's
online
campaign
fundraising
yesterday
in
Obama
campaign
using
untraceable
donations
The
story
was
published
on
page
2
Mosk
reported
in
the
second
and
third
paragraphs
of
the
story
Sen
Barack
Obama's
presidential
campaign
is
allowing
donors
to
use
largely
untraceable
prepaid
credit
cards
that
could
potentially
be
used
to
evade
limits
on
how
much
an
individual
is
legally
allowed
to
give
or
to
mask
a
contributor's
identity
campaign
officials
confirmed
Faced
with
a
huge
influx
of
donations
over
the
Internet
the
campaign
has
also
chosen
not
to
use
basic
security
measures
to
prevent
potentially
illegal
or
anonymous
contributions
from
flowing
into
its
accounts
aides
acknowledged
Instead
the
campaign
is
scrutinizing
its
books
for
improper
donations
after
the
money
has
been
deposited
The
Obama
organization
said
its
extensive
review
has
ensured
that
the
campaign
has
refunded
any
improper
contributions
and
noted
that
Federal
Election
Commission
rules
do
not
require
front-end
screening
of
donations
In
recent
weeks
questionable
contributions
have
created
headaches
for
Obama's
accounting
team
as
it
has
tried
to
explain
why
campaign
finance
filings
have
included
itemized
donations
from
individuals
using
fake
names
such
as
Es
Esh
or
Doodad
Pro
Those
revelations
prompted
conservative
bloggers
to
further
test
Obama's
finance
vetting
by
giving
money
using
the
kind
of
prepaid
cards
that
can
be
bought
at
a
drugstore
and
cannot
be
traced
to
a
donor
Mosk
is
to
be
congratulated
on
getting
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
heart
of
the
story
after
his
earlier
The
story
is
an
improvement
over
his
unbelievably
obtuse
page-one
story
Campaign
finance
gets
new
scrutiny
this
past
Sunday
Yet
Mosk's
story
yesterday
is
still
lacking
It
fails
to
observe
that
the
McCain
campaign's
online
donation
screen
contributors
through
the
use
of
the
basic
Address
Verification
System
On
the
contary
it
creates
the
false
impression
that
the
McCain
campaign
is
party
to
the
same
modus
operandi
Moreover
despite
the
implication
of
the
Obama
campaign's
statement
that
it
provides
extensive
review
to
donations
received
online
Mosk
fails
to
note
that
Obama
contributors
using
a
valid
credit
card
but
a
fictitious
name
and
address
cannot
be
effectively
screened
once
they
have
been
accepted
That's
why
the
McCain
campaign
is
using
AVS
security
and
the
Obama
campaign
is
not
but
Mosk's
story
blurs
the
difference
between
the
campaigns
Mosk's
regurgitation
of
the
statement
that
the
Obama
campaign
has
ensured
that
it
has
refunded
any
improper
contributions
is
ludicrous
We
know
for
example
that
John
Galt
Osama
bin
Laden
Bill
Ayers
Saddam
Hussein
Della
Ware
and
Adolfe
Hitler
among
many
others
are
still
waiting
for
their
refunds
Again
one
wonders
if
Mosk
means
to
be
obtuse
Mosk
also
relates
the
Obama
campaign's
comment
that
Federal
Election
Commission
rules
do
not
require
front-end
screening
of
donations
But
failing
to
screen
donors
at
the
front
end
coincidentally
facilitates
the
violation
of
basic
federal
campaign
finance
law
Federal
campaign
finance
law
requires
donors
contributing
over
200
to
be
identified
limits
donations
to
a
total
of
2,300
and
prohibits
foreigners
from
contributing
The
Obama
campaign's
intentional
disabling
of
basic
AVS
credit
card
security
knowingly
facilitates
criminal
fraud
and
illegal
contributions
Is
this
too
difficult
a
concept
to
grasp
John
Ronning
for
example
provides
a
step-by-step
set
of
instructions
for
foreigners
seeking
to
contribute
to
the
Obama
campaign
One
might
think
this
story
is
something
of
a
scandal
but
Mosk
doesn't
get
it
He
sees
no
causal
connection
between
the
Obama
campaign's
deliberate
disabling
of
AVS
credit
card
security
with
a
with
a
huge
influx
of
donations
over
the
Internet
With
two-thirds
of
Obama's
150
million
September
haul
having
come
over
the
Internet
you'd
think
it
might
dawn
on
a
dogged
reporter
that
the
end
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
means
Mosk
might
have
asked
the
Obama
campaign
why
it
has
chosen
to
continue
in
this
manner
knowing
it
is
accepting
contributions
that
violate
federal
law
Yesterday
for
example
Crazy
Eight
from
Swindler
Lane
made
a
25
dollar
donation
to
the
Obama
campaign
It
went
right
through
to
my
credit
card
after
a
two-day
delay
writes
Mr
Eight
No
security
code
No
address
check
No
name
verification
Nothing
Unbelievable
Mr
Eight
was
in
good
company
yesterday
He
was
joined
by
Karl
Marx
Our
man
John
Galt
writes
with
questions
and
comments
that
seem
to
have
eluded
Matthew
Mosk
Given
the
bad
PR
and
the
additional
cost
for
all
their
CC
transactions
why
is
the
AVS
still
turned
off
This
story
first
broke
in
the
blogs
in
a
big
way
last
Wednesday
and
the
MSM
starting
asking
the
Obama
campaign
about
it
by
the
end
of
the
week
So
the
Obama
campaign
surely
knows
the
basic
facts
of
the
story
and
its
potential
liability
that
they
don't
have
even
the
most
basic
security
measures
initiated
at
their
website
Just
to
cover
their
butts
don't
you
think
they
would
have
turned
those
features
back
on
So
they
can
claim
Yes
we
discovered
the
issue
and
have
rectified
it
several
days
ago...blah
blah
blah
So
I
tested
the
system
yet
again
this
morning
with
the
same
credit
card
this
time
with
Karl
Marx
as
the
donor
and
sure
enough
it
went
through
But
why
Why
would
they
continue
to
expose
themselves
to
this
potential
scandal
My
bet
is
in
spite
of
their
claims
that
it's
too
difficult
to
make
the
info
available
they
know
down
to
the
penny
the
exact
details
of
all
their
under
200
donors
and
the
serial-CC-fraudsters
and
the
simply
can't
afford
to
give
up
the
money
Also
as
reported
here
it's
actually
costing
them
more
per
transaction
to
process
all
their
online
donations
Even
the
ones
that
aren't
fraudulent
So
they
know
this
is
a
PR
issue
and
it's
more
expensive
on
a
per
transaction
basis
yet
the
AVS
remains
disabled
I
can
only
conclude
that
they
know
this
is
such
a
significant
percentage
of
their
overall
revenue
that
in
spite
of
the
publicity
they
have
to
continue
to
allow
the
fraud
in
order
to
meet
their
budget
goals
They
must
know
just
how
many
of
those
small
donations
are
coming
from
fraudulent
sources
and
if
they
turn
the
security
on
it
could
drastically
impact
those
150
million
donation
months
If
they
did
publicly
announce
that
they
restored
the
security
features
and
a
big
drop
in
the
fundraising
figures
ensued
it
would
only
confirm
all
the
fraud
up
to
that
point
Meaning
if
the
fundraising
reports
were
to
show
a
big
drop
in
CC
transactions
after
they
turned
the
AVS
back
on
it
would
be
evidence
of
the
crime
The
sophisticated
gentlemen
running
the
Obama
campaign
know
exactly
what
they
are
doing
John
Galt
has
caught
on
Matthew
Mosk
doesn't
quite
get
it
but
at
least
he's
making
a
show
of
trying
It's
more
than
can
be
said
of
his
illustrious
colleagues
in
the
MSM
UPDATE
You
can
see

importance
of
the

The
Philadelphia
Phillies
won
the
World
Series
tonight
by
taking
Monday's
suspended
game
4-3
The
winning
run
scored
thanks
in
large
part
to
a
to
lead-off
double
in
the
seventh
inning
by
Pat
Burrell
The
Phillies
bunted
Burrell's
pinch
runner
to
third
correction-the
runner
actually
move
to
third
on
a
ground
out
and
he
scored
on
a
single
by
Pedro
Feliz
The
main
talking
point
of
the
game
will
be
the
decision
of
Tampa
Bay
manager
Joe
Maddon
to
let
left-handed
pitcher
J.P
Howell
bat
in
the
top
of
the
inning
with
the
right-handed
hitting
Burrell
due
to
lead
off
the
bottom
The
Fox
broadcasting
crew
informed
us
that
Madden
liked
this
match-up
but
it's
not
clear
why
Burrell
hits
lefties
better
than
righties
951
on-base
percentage
plus
slugging
percentage
compared
to
843
And
right-hander
Chad
Bradford
who
eventually
came
on
in
relief
is
more
effective
against
righty
hitters
than
Howell
though
not
by
much
581
compared
to
604
Nor
could
Maddon
have
been
relying
on
Howell's
past
history
against
Burrell
the
two
have
always
played
in
different
leagues
These
numbers
don't
necessarily
tell
the
whole
story
Maddon
may
have
had
valid
reasons
for
liking
the
Howell-Burrell
match-up
But
Tampa
Bay's
fans
will
probably
want
to
know
what
they
were
By
the
way
baseball
may
be
on
to
something
with
the
three
and
a
half

game

The
Los
Angeles
Times
is
sitting
on
a
video
tape
of
a
notorious
farewell
party
for
Barack
Obama's
good
friend
Rashid
Khalidi
Khalidi
is
a
former
spokesman
albeit
perhaps
an
informal
one
for
Yaser
Arafat's
PLO
and
a
long-time
apologist
for
terrorists
who
advocates
a
one-state
solution
for
the
Middle
East
i.e
the
eradication
of
Israel
The
L.A
Times
has
reported
that
Obama
attended
the
party
for
his
friend
as
did
Bill
Ayers
The
paper
says
it
has
a
video
of
the
event
and
that
Obama
gave
some
kind
of
a
talk
But
it
refuses
to
release
the
video
claiming--perhaps
belatedly--that
it
promised
its
source
to
keep
the
video
confidential
Today
both
John
McCain
and
Sarah
Palin
went
after
the
Times
If
there
was
a
tape
of
John
McCain
in
a
neo-Nazi
outfit
I
think
the
treatment
of
the
issue
would
be
slightly
different
McCain
said
in
an
interview
with
Hispanic
radio
stations
Palin
said
the
Times
should
win
a
Pulitzer
Prize
for
kowtowing
It
must
be
nice
for
a
candidate
to
have
major
news
organizations
looking
out
for
their
best
interests
like
that
Politicians
would
love
to
have
a
pet
newspaper
of
their
very
own
she
said
The
Times
claim
that
it
can't
release
the
video
because
of
a
promise
made
to
its
source
raises
a
number
of
questions
First
is
there
any
support
for
the
claim
that
such
a
promise
was
given
Is
it
documented
in
any
way
Or
is
it
something
that
a
Times
reporter
made
up
just
this
week
to
protect
Obama
Second
why
would
the
paper's
source
have
extracted
such
a
commitment
The
source
evidently
thought
the
event
was
newsworthy
and
wanted
it
reported
upon
He
or
she
gave
the
video
to
the
Times
What
sense
would
it
make
to
give
the
paper
the
video
so
as
to
enable
a
news
story
to
be
written
but
demand
that
the
video
itself
remain
secret
Perhaps
the
video
would
in
some
fashion
compromise
the
identity
of
the
source
But
couldn't
footage
of
the
speeches
given
by
Obama
and
others
be
made
public
while
editing
out
any
personal
material
that
might
identify
the
source
Or
couldn't
an
audio
tape
be
made
from
the
video
There
is
no
way
that
an
audio
tape
could
give
away
the
identity
of
the
person
who
made
the
video
Third
has
the
Times
tried
to
persuade
its
source
to
allow
the
video
to
be
made
public
even
in
edited
form
as
suggested
above
I
have
seen
no
representation
by
the
Times
that
it
has
made
any
such
effort
even
though
it
is
routine
for
newspapers
to
pressure
sources
not
to
insist
on
pledges
of
confidentiality
In
this
case
the
promise--even
if
we
assume
it
was
actually
given--conveniently
coincides
with
the
political
preferences
of
the
Los
Angeles
Times
Finally
as
many
others
have
noted
the
Times
was
willing
to
abandon
all
known
standards
of
journalism
when
it
was
a
matter
of
smearing
Republican
Arnold
Schwarzenegger
with
sensational
but
uncorroborated
allegations
on
the
eve
of
the
2003
recall
election
The
paper's
rationale
at
the
time
was
that
the
public's
need
to
know
the
details
of
the
scurrilous
but
irrelevant
claims
was
so
vast
that
it
just
had
to
publish
them
So
what
has
changed
since
2003
Or
are
we
just
seeing
the
difference
between
how
the
Times
treats
Republicans
and
how
it
treats
Democrats

The
World
Series
resumes
tonight
where
it
left
off
on
Monday
with
Philadelphia
batting
at
the
start
of
the
bottom
of
the
sixth
inning
and
the
score
tied
at
2-2
If
the
Phillies
win
the
Series
is
over
If
not
it
will
return
to
Tampa
and
we
could
have
something
memorable
on
our
hands
The
odds
favor
the
Phillies
tonight
First
they
have
an
extra
half
inning
in
which
to
bat
Second
both
teams
presumably
will
rely
on
their
relief
pitchers
and
the
Phils
have
a
better
bullpen
Third
the
game
is
in
Philadelphia
But
a
rain
delay
in
Boston
in
Game
2
of
the
1975
World
Series
with
Boston
up
by
a
game
and
a
run
seemed
to
turn
the
tide
in
favor
of
Cincinnati
And
that
delay
lasted
only
half
an
hour
If
the
Series
returns
to
Tampa
Philadelphia
being
a
game
up
will
still
be
favored
But
Tampa
Bay
is
very
tough
at
home
and
the
pitching
match-ups
will
slightly
favor
the
Rays
In
addition
there
are
finally
signs
of
life
from
Tampa
Bay
sluggers
Carlos
Pena
and
Evan
Longoria
This
World
Series
has
reminded
me
both
of
why
I
used
to
love
baseball
and
why
I
am
now
just
a
casual
fan
Game
3
had
it
all
a
blown
call
that
probably
gifted
Tampa
Bay
two
runs
the
Phillies
and
the
Rays
both
scoring
key
runs
without
the
benefit
of
a
ball
hit
out
of
the
infield
and
the
wheels-within-wheels
you
typically
see
in
a
game
that's
decided
in
the
bottom
of
the
ninth
especially
when
there
is
no
designated
hitter
Yet
I
find
it
impossible
to
be
head-over-heels
for
a
sport
that
determines
its
champion
in
the
kind
of
conditions
that
are
almost
inevitable
in
late
October
I
also
struggle
with
the
length
of
the
games
particularly
given
their
starting
times
My
view
hasn't
changed
much
since
1994
when
baseball
cancelled
its
World
Series
if
baseball
can't
show
more
respect
for
its
product
why
should

I
mentioned
last
night
that
intuitively
the
momentum
in
Minnesota's
Senate
race
seems
to
be
shifting
toward
Norm
Coleman
As
well
it
should--Norm
is
one
of
the
ablest
members
of
the
Senate
and
his
opponent
Al
Franken
is
a
bitter
former
comedian
with
a
violent
temper
who
moved
from
New
York
to
Minnesota
to
enter
the
Senate
race
In
a
normal
year
it
wouldn't
even
be
a
contest
But
this
year
with
voters
feeling
insecure
and
the
Democratic
Party
awash
in
cash
Franken
has
been
able
to
make
a
race
of
it
Coleman
has
campaigned
non-stop
lately
with
the
help
of
Governor
Tim
Pawlenty
and
has
gained
from
simultaneous
endorsements
by
the
Minneapolis
Star
Tribune
and
the
St
Paul
Pioneer
Press
The
polls
have
been
all
over
the
lot
but
Scott
Rasmussen
has
found
Franken
in
the
lead
through
the
month
of
October
In
a
survey
released
today
however
Rasmussen
has
Coleman
surging
to
a
four
point
lead
I'm
pretty
confident
that
Coleman
will
continue
to
pull
away
as
voters
get
serious
about
the
idea
of
sending
a
vulgar
hateful
former
comedian
to
the
Senate
But

not
take
any

staffer
for
Project
Vote
which
she
described
as
a
sister
organization
of
ACORN
said
her
supervisor
told
her
the
list
of
campaign
contributors
came
from
the
Obama
campaign
Moncrief
said
she
has
a
copy
of
a
development
plan
that
outlines
how
Obama
contributors
who
had
maxed
out
under
federal
contribution
limits
would
be
targeted
to
give
to
Project
Vote
and
that
it
was
her
job
to
identify
such
contributors
Moncrief
testified
that
ACORN
and
Project
Vote
were
virtually
identical
So
the
Obama
campaign
gave
ACORN
a
list
of
donors
who
had
given
the
maximum
allowable
contributions
to
Obama
and
urged
ACORN
to
contact
those
donors
to
get
them
to
help
Obama
some
more
by
contributing
to
ACORN
There's
nothing
wrong
with
that
except
that
1
ACORN
is
the
country's
number
one
source
of
voter
registration
fraud
and
2
the
relationship
between
the
Obama
campaign
and
ACORN
which
Obama
insists
is
non-existent
is
in
fact
symbiotic
at
a
minimum
Of
course
no
story
of
this
sort
would
be
complete
without
thuggish
behavior
by
the
Left
Moncrief
said
she
had
received
repeated
warnings
to
back
off
from
testifying
today
by
people
she
knows
at
ACORN
Hey
don't
worry
In
a
few
months
these
people
will
be
running
the
Justice
Department
UPDATE
A
little
while
ago
McCain
campaign
manager
Rick
Davis
released
this
statement
Today's
testimony
by
a
former
employee
of
an
ACORN
affiliate
proves
Barack
Obama
is
guilty
of
lying
to
the
American
people
about
his
relationship
with
ACORN
At
the
last
presidential
debate
in
front
of
sixty
million
people
Barack
Obama
said
his
campaign
was
not
involved
with
ACORN
We
now
know
that
Barack
Obama's
campaign
was
working
hand-in-glove
with
an
organization
reportedly
under
investigation
by
the
F.B.I
and
in
more
than
a
dozen
states
In
addition
to
funneling
832,000
to
ACORN
for
get-out-the-vote
efforts
the
Obama
campaign
and
ACORN
have
been
sharing
donor
lists
encouraging
maxed-out
Obama
donors
to
contribute
to
this
unethical
organization

brilliantly
sums
up
the
Obama
campaign's--and
for
the
most
part
the
mainstream
media's--position
that
the
only
honorable
thing
Republicans
can
do
is
concede
the
Presidential
election
