Since
our
launch
yesterday
I've
been
spending
a
lot
of
my
time
getting
The
Next
Right
off
the
ground
We're
really
jazzed
about
the
reaction
so
far
9,000
uniques
and
over
20,000
pageviews
on
the
first
alone
and
on
track
for
another
big
day
As
I've
mentioned
before
I'll
be
moving
most
of
my
political
blogging
over
to
the
new
platform
There
will
be
some
tech/personal
stuff
that
pops
up
here
from
time
to
time
but
most
of
my
energies
on
the
blogging
front
will
be
devoted
to
The
Next
Right
community
The
easiest
way
to
keep
in
touch
is
to
subscribe
to
my
RSS
feed
Through
the
magic
of
Yahoo
Pipes
my
blogs
from
The
Next
Right
will
show
up
automagically
in
the
feed
along
with
stuff
from
here
I
hope
all
regular
readers
will
join
me
in
making
The
Next
Right
a
daily
pit
stop

Unifying
Narratives
Work
Microtrends
Fail
by

May

David
All
argues
that
the
proliferation
of
competing
agendas
now
emanating
from
individual
Republican
House
members
misses
the
point
I
agree
but
for
very
different
reasons
than
David
His
essential
argument
is
that
Republicans
should
ditch
any
hope
for
a
Contract-style
agenda
Gone
are
the
days
of
Newt
Gingrich's
Contract
for
America
a
plan
which
every
Republican
got
behind
and
backed
A
unified
agenda
back
in
1994
was
possible
because
of
Newt
Gingrich's
intoxicating
personality
and
strong
leadership
style
but
it
was
also
a
different
time
a
time
before
the
Internet
inspired
a
culture
of
choice
and
information
Today
thanks
to
the
Internet
each
Member
of
Congress
can
and
should
be
fighting
in
the
trenches
for
the
hundreds
of
issues
which
drive
their
voters
to
the
polls
under
the
banner
of
the
Republican
Party
The
Internet
provides
a
medium
to
distribute
our
message
like
never
before
We
can
fight
on
thousands
of
fronts
Rather
than
being
forced
to
to
pick
a
few
limited
set
of
agenda
items
House
Republicans
should
change
the
game
and
act
more
like
iTunes
and
NetFlix
offering
conservative
libertarian
and
independent
voters
a
lot
of
different
choices
all
of
which
can
only
be
found
under
the
larger
brand
Republican
This
overlooks
the
most
salient
example
Obama
the
epitome
of
the
new
net-centric
candidate
Obama
has
actually
thrived
on
a
very
strong
unified
message
Change
Hope
This
is
not
an
agenda
It's
deliberately
vague
But
the
message
is
as
clear
and
unifying
as
Reagan's
optimism
Those
who
celebrate
the
bottom-up
nature
of
the
Obama
campaign
can't
deny
its
top-down
cult
of
personality
aggressive
brand
management
aspects
I
was
recently
discussing
the
difference
between
the
Clinton
and
Obama
campaigns
with
a
GOP
pollster
in
town
In
the
conversation
an
interesting
point
came
up
that
Obama
has
beat
Clinton
because
he's
refused
the
play
the
small-bore
microtargeting
game
epitomized
by
her
ex-strategist
and
Microtrends
author
Mark
Penn
Obama
has
run
on
a
big
national
message
of
generational
change
in
both
red
and
blue
states
and
it's
worked
Democratic
voters
have
latched
on
to
this
narrative
There
may
not
have
been
a
mass
market
for
a
46-year
old
guy
named
Barack
as
President
a
year
ago
but
now
there
is
He
created
it
That
takes
a
big
aspirational
message
that's
bigger
than
the
sum
total
of
a
bunch
of
issue
positions
and
demographic
segments
The
Internet
doesn't
change
that
It
actually
amplifies
the
success
of
popular
messages
at
the
head
of
the
long
tail
The
common
thread
of
Internet
success
stories
is
that
they
tend
to
be
really
big
success
stories
the
enhanced
variety
offered
by
the
long
tail
notwithstanding
Think
of
Google
Apple
and
Obama
What
Obama
has
done
for
change
represents
what
the
Republican
Revolutionaries
did
with
the
Contract
with
America
They
married
the
Republican
brand
to
the
idea
of
Reform
Republicans
may
have
won
in
1994
without
the
Contract
but
they
would
have
governed
a
whole
lot
differently
without
it
Without
a
well-branded
agenda
they
would
have
more
quickly
drifted
into
a
boring
piecemeal
floor
schedule
The
problem
with
the
current
agendas
on
offer
is
that
they're
small-bore
They
act
as
though
we
were
still
in
the
majority
and
our
job
was
to
fine-tune
the
workings
of
government
It's
not
In
the
minority
our
job
is
to
1
make
the
majority's
life
miserable
grinding
the
House
and
Senate
floors
to
a
halt
and
building
a
narrative
of
the
Democrats
as
broken
and
incompetent
and
2
offer
big
bold
alternatives
to
this
mess
like
the
Contract
did
in
1994
We'll
be
discussing
more
of
what
these
agenda
items
might
be
over
at
The
Next
Right
but
I
imagine
it
would
be
things
on
this
scale
A
total
ban
on
earmarks
Let
the
half
of
Federal
workers
due
to
retire
in
the
next
few
years
retire
and
don't
replace
them
Personal
Social
Security
accounts
A
50
cut
in
farm
subsidies
yeah
good
luck
on
that
after
this
week
McCain's
idea
of
replacing
supplementing
the
UN
with
a
league
of
democracies
There's
a
market
for
this
kind
of
change
When
Tom
Cole
posted
a
few
of
the
incrementalist
agenda
items
to
the
NRCC
blog
I
couldn't
count
a
single
positive
comment
in
favor
of
the
nearly
2,000
posted
This
shows
the
disconnect
between
Washington
and
the
grassroots
Instead
of
boldness
many
members
still
think
a
1998-style
litany
of
practical
solutions
will
work
for
a
party
that
could
be
headed
into
the
wilderness
without
a
shock
to
the
system

Beyond
Bush
by
Patrick
Ruffini
May
16th
2008
9:44
pm
The
hue
and
cry
for
the
GOP
to
file
for
divorce
against
President
Bush
is
reaching
a
crescendo
with
Tom
Davis's
acid-tongued
barbs
and
this
more
gracefully
worded
column
by
2004
Bush
campaign
advisor
Peggy
Noonan
Davis
and
Noonan
mean
well
but
their
proposed
strategy
amounts
to
taking
the
Democrats
bait
Because
whether
the
GOP
decides
to
run
for
Bush
or
against
him
the
meta-narrative
will
still
be
about
Bush
Any
day
people
are
reminded
of
the
President
in
a
political
context
even
when
our
people
are
throwing
him
under
the
bus
is
a
bad
day
for
Republicans
President
Bush
is
a
lame
duck
His
term
expires
in
eight
months
Politically
speaking
John
McCain
is
the
leader
of
the
party
Bush's
term
will
overlap
that
of
the
111th
Congress
by
a
whopping
17
days
Why
should
Republican
Congressional
candidates
take
the
bait
by
positioning
themselves
vis
a
vis
someone
who
will
be
a
political
non-factor
once
they
take
office
If
they
embrace
President
Bush
it's
political
poison
If
they
make
a
fuss
of
distancing
themselves
it
guarantees
headlines
with
Candidate
X
and
Bush
in
close
proximity
and
looks
politically
motivated
Don't
take
the
bait
The
challenge
for
Republicans
is
not
to
support
Bush
or
to
reject
Bush
but
to
transcend
Bush
We
are
quickly
nearing
the
point
where
the
last
piece
of
meaningful
legislation
will
cross
this
President's
desk
To
suggest
that
Republicans
might
want
to
get
around
to
crafting
a
post-Bush
agenda
ignores
the
fact
that
the
post-Bush
era
is
already
upon
us
It
began
March
4
when
John
McCain
secured
1,191
delegates
Start
acting
like
it
John
McCain
is
the
only
national
Republican
local
Republicans
should
be
talking
about
Republican
candidates
could
do
well
by
parrying
attempts
to
tie
them
to
Bush
as
follows
It
doesn't
take
a
genius
to
figure
out
that
President
Bush
sparks
strong
feelings
on
both
sides
But
last
I
checked
there's
an
election
coming
up
soon
to
replace
George
Bush
I'm
focused
on
the
future
and
the
next
Congress
and
the
next
President
There's
only
one
person
in
this
race
who's
fixated
on
the
past
and
on
George
Bush
and
that's
my
opponent
I
can
only
assume
that's
because
he'd
love
to
continue
the
hyper-partisanship
of
the
last
decade
Not
me
With
all
due
respect
my
opinion
of
President
Bush
matters
about
as
much
as
my
opinion
of
President
Coolidge
They'll
both
be
in
the
history
books
come
next
January
When
I
hit
the
ground
running
in
2009
I
look
forward
to
serving
with
President
McCain
to
bringing
gas
prices
down
and
our
troops
home
victorious
This
has
the
advantage
of
being
intellectually
honest
Voters
are
forward-looking
and
know
that
Bush
won't
be
President
soon
In
no
other
election
since
2000
could
you
say
this
By
subjecting
themselves
to
a
massive
internal
debate
over
the
President
Republicans
would
validate
the
Democratic
narrative
of
this
election
as
a
referendum
on
Bush
Just
ask
Al
Gore
how
productive
meta-debates
about
the
President's
role
in
his
exit
year
really
are
And
his
boss
was
at
65
Don't
take
the
bait
Like
this
piece
Then
you'll
love

John
McCain
Tolstoy
in
My
Inbox
by
Patrick
Ruffini
May
15th
2008
11:20
pm
Today
I
sat
in
on
my
first
McCain
blogger
conference
call
and
cheered
as
McCain
promised
to
continue
these
sessions
on
a
biweekly
basis
as
President
Contrast
with
Barack
Obama
whose
netroots
coordinator
left
in
frustration
at
Obama's
refusal
to
be
similarly
accessible
And
this
comes
on
top
of
weekly
press
conferences
and
submitting
to
questions
in
the
well
of
the
House
a
la
the
British
Prime
Minister
McCain
could
become
the
most
transparent
and
cross-examined
President
in
history
Online
it
seems
to
be
a
different
story
at
least
when
it
comes
the
image
of
John
McCain
as
projected
on
JohnMcCain.com
and
in
the
daily
emails
that
go
out
under
his
name
Good
online
strategy
is
simple
reflect
the
very
best
of
your
candidate
offline
John
McCain
offline
is
transparent
accessible
and
willing
to
answer
any
question
John
McCain
online
is
stilted
and
awkwardly
asking
me
for
money
There's
a
fundamental
disconnect
The
email
the
McCain
camp
sent
today
illustrates
the
problem
I'm
deliberately
zooming
out
because
I
don't
want
you
to
focus
on
the
copy
These
are
recent
emails
sent
by
Barack
Obama
and
Hillary
Clinton
Even
from
a
distance
it's
night
and
day
You've
got
brevity
and
short
rapid-fire
paragraphs
They
feature
a
clear
call
to
action
above
the
fold
They're
highly
readable
or
more
to
the
point
scannable
since
the
average
reader
online
reads
no
more
than
20
of
content
They
respect
today's
attention-deprived
user
Less
is
more
Most
important
is
what
these
messages
say
about
the
candidate
These
messages
were
crafted
solely
for
the
e-mail
channel
I
don't
know
about
you
but
the
e-mails
I
get
everyday
from
friends
and
colleagues
look
a
lot
more
like
Hillary
and
Barack's
e-mails
than
they
do
War
and
Peace
I've
even
entertained
the
thought
of
Obama
banging
out
a
few
pithy
sentences
on
the
MacBook
Pro
in
the
hotel
suite
on
the
way
to
the
victory
party
it's
believable
enough
I
know
that
he
didn't
but
the
fact
that
I've
wondered
counts
for
something
McCain's
e-mail
start
off
with
the
anachronistic
From
the
Desk
of
John
McCain
a
1970s-era
direct
mail
device
I
haven't
seen
on
a
piece
of
real
stationery
in
a
decade
The
haughty
phrasing
is
designed
to
evoke
a
sense
of
prestige
the
sense
that
the
person
addressing
you
is
Big
and
Important
But
the
Internet
is
not
about
being
Big
and
Important
It's
about
being
One
of
Us
Again
fundamental
disconnect
McCain
offline
gets
this
shedding
the
trappings
of
the
Imperial
Presidency
McCain
online
not
so
much
But
that
concern
pales
in
comparison
to
the
content
Today's
e-mail
in
marked
contrast
to
the
short
e-mail-like
e-mails
from
Hillary
and
Barack
is
lifted
from
speech
text
In
that
he
spoke
the
words
it
is
him
But
it's
not
him
communicating
something
unique
for
the
online
audience
It's
him
or
his
handlers
keeping
us
at
a
safe
distance
using
the
most
formal
version
of
McCain
possible
again
the
polar
opposite
of
what
McCain's
offline
strategy
is
about
The
explanation
for
why
this
is
actually
very
prosaic
the
approval
process
In
a
short-staffed
campaign
the
easiest
and
sometimes
the
only
option
is
to
lift
from
already
approved
text
Nobody
has
the
time
to
spend
up
to
24
hours
getting
all
new
text
approved
by
McCain
or
his
closest
advisers
by
which
time
the
window
of
opportunity
may
have
passed
And
McCain's
signature
nets
more
money
than
Rick
Davis's
no
matter
how
you
word
the
message
Don't
let
the
perfect
be
the
enemy
of
the
good
In
the
moment
it
all
makes
sense
The
problem
is
that
over
time
you
wind
up
cheapening
McCain's
personal
brand
Maybe
I'm
being
a
Steve
Jobs-like
pie-in-the-sky
perfectionist
here
but
having
to
play
along
with
the
illusion
that
John
McCain
sat
down
at
his
desk
to
deliver
us
gobs
of
text
is
demeaning
both
to
us
and
to
McCain
This
is
not
direct
mail
We
are
not
some
people
data-mined
off
a
consumer
list
who've
never
heard
from
you
before
We
opted-in
We
are
the
top
1
the
savviest
most
interested
most
influential
supporters
We
get
the
joke
On
the
flip
side
consider
how
much
Hillary
and
Obama
get
simply
by
seeming
real
in
their
e-mails
even
if
they
don't
get
to
cram
in
as
many
policy
points
This
may
all
seem
very
esoteric
but
it's
important
The
pixels
you
see
in
the
Hillary
and
Barack
e-mails
fueled
the
rise
of
the
biggest
people-powered
fundraising
machine
in
history
It's
worth
studying
how
they
do
things
at
a
very
minute
level
Improvement
starts
by
smashing
the
desk
and
giving
us
the
real

There

no

tonight's
result
in

Thankfully
the
NRCC
doesn't
even
try
issuing
a
soberly
worded
statement
from
Chairman
Tom
Cole
in
lieu
of
the
usual
upbeat
results
memo
T]he
political
environment
is
such
that
voters
remain
pessimistic
about
the
direction
of
the
country
and
the
Republican
Party
in
general
Therefore
Republicans
must
undertake
bold
efforts
to
define
a
forward
looking
agenda
that
offers
the
kind
of
positive
change
voters
are
looking
for
This
is
something
we
can
do
in
cooperation
with
our
Presidential
nominee
but
time
is
short
I
encourage
all
Republican
candidates
whether
incumbents
or
challengers
to
take
stock
of
their
campaigns
and
position
themselves
for
challenging
campaigns
this
fall
by
building
the
financial
resources
and
grassroots
networks
that
offer
them
the
opportunity
and
ability
to
communicate
energize
and
turn
out
voters
this
election
The
problem
with
this
is
that
they're
pushing
a
change
message
with
the
same
faces
The
guy
at
the
top
of
the
ticket
represents
his
own
kind
of
change
But
if
we
want
2008
to
be
more
than
a
lonely
victory
you
need
a
changing
of
the
guard
at
the
leadership
and
the
candidate
level
I'm
not
going
to
say
that
heads
roll
because
of
these
three
elections
alone
but
if
we
fail
to
recapture
the
House
or
make
surprising
headway
towards
that
goal
we
need
to
be
pretty
firm
that
the
current
leadership
must
resign
en
masse
Boehner
and
Blunt
have
six
months
to
turn
this
ship
around
In
fact
this
should
become
a
standing
rule
You
lose
you
resign
We
will
start
winning
a
lot
faster
once
there
are
consequences
for
losing
That's
how
it
works
in
every
Parliamentary
system
One
party
loses
the
election
even
by
a
little
and
the
old
guard
turns
over
the
keys
It
may
take
two
or
three
tries
but
usually
this
results
in
leaders
who
not
only
talk
different
but
are
different
The
grassroots
needs
to
work
to
create
this
same
sort
of
accountability
here
And
we
need
quit
outsourcing
Congressional
elections
to
the
Presidential
level
since
nationalizing
the
electon
worked
real
well
in
MS-1
and
LA-6

MS-1
Will
Nationalizing
Obama
Work
by
Patrick
Ruffini
May
11th
2008
10:48
pm
Another
too-close-for-comfort
special
election
looms
on
Tuesday
with
Republican
Greg
Davis
in
a
dogfight
with
Democrat
Travis
Childers
in
MS-1
a
Bush
62
Cook
PVI
R+10
seat
Childers
nearly
won
an
outright
majority
in
first
round
balloting
two
weeks
ago
Once
again
the
strategy
of
tying
Obama
to
a
Democratic
Congressional
candidate
is
being
tested
aggressively
with
Childers
stirring
the
pot
after
denying
Obama
had
endorsed
him
when
he
in
fact
had
This
was
what
the
NRCC
put
on
the
air
in
LA-6
our
last
special
election
defeat
It's
no
wonder
Woody
Jenkins
came
up
short
This
is
a
conventional
cookie
cutter
ad
that
could
have
been
run
in
any
of
the
other
434
districts
in
any
election
this
past
decade
The
NRCC
claims
some
credit
for
tightening
the
race
from
the
5-9
point
lead
Don
Cazayoux
had
a
week
or
so
out
to
three
points
but
at
the
House
level
and
with
the
additional
variable
of
a
conservative
independent
on
the
ballot
that
spread
is
not
too
convincing
Obama/taxes
was
ALL
the
NRCC
ran
in
LA-6
The
NRCC's
IE
unit
is
doing
better
work
in
MS-1
targeting
its
ads
squarely
against
Childers
Still
the
Obama
message
is
being
heard
in
a
big
way
with
Freedom's
Watch
dumping
at
least
500,000
into
anti-Obama
spots
like
this
one
I
have
to
ask
Is
this
it
Is
this
the
best
we
can
do
Demonizing
Nancy
Pelosi
has
worked
nowhere
because
of
the
Speaker's
milquetoast
public
persona
Absent
some
scandal
or
hugely
controversial
statement
it's
difficult
to
nationalize
a
local
race
around
a
party
leader
In
the
wake
of
Rev
Wright
and
bitter
some
are
betting
Obama
can
be
this
lightning
rod
He
may
well
be
but
these
special
elections
are
the
wrong
places
to
test
the
theory
Special
elections
are
low-turnout
affairs
dominated
by
high
information
voters
likely
to
know
a
lot
about
local
issues
These
are
the
voters
least
likely
to
be
swayed
by
a
boilerplate
nationalization
of
the
race
This
is
part
of
why
specials
can
often
diverge
so
wildly
from
the
partisan
trend
in
a
district
despite
the
local
majority
party's
best
efforts
In
special
elections
more
than
most
elections
candidates
rise
and
fall
on
their
own
merits
In
the
general
election
with
an
extremely
high
noise
level
surrounding
the
Presidential
race
and
Congressional
elections
an
afterthought
Republicans
might
have
better
luck
with
tying
red
state
Democrats
to
Obama
In
November
a
smaller
percentage
of
the
electorate
will
be
making
an
independent
decision
about
a
local
Congressional
candidate
For
many
their
Presidential
vote
will
influence
their
votes
down
ballot
This
is
why
we
seldom
see
huge
partisan
swings
at
the
Congressional
level
in
Presidential
election
years
Expanding
the
universe
of
low-information
partisans
voting
tends
to
dampen
the
partisan
mood
swings
we
see
in
midterms
In
Presidential
election
years
districts
more
easily
revert
to
their
partisan
norms
normally
a
good
thing
in
places
like
LA-6
and
MS-1
Still
we
have
to
do
better
than
the
ads
Republicans
have
run
in
these
spring
specials
which
are
so
conventional
they'll
automatically
get
tuned
out
and
have
zero
persuasive
impact
whatsoever

The
Left's
Stupid
Anti-McCain
Messaging
by
Patrick
Ruffini
May
9th
2008
11:41
pm
Third
Bush
Term
The
Bush-McCain
hug
McSame
Excuse
me
while
I
McYawn
For
all
the
left
has
done
to
move
bodies
and
build
infrastructure
there's
one
area
in
which
they
remain
woefully
lacking
message
Nowhere
is
this
more
apparent
in
their
central
charge
against
McCain
that
he's
a
Bush
clone
from
top
to
bottom
From
the
Obama
campaign
to
the
DNC
to
527s
and
c4s
like
David
Brock's
Progressive
Media
USA
you'll
see
this
repeated
over
and
over
With
President
Bush's
approval
ratings
in
the
toilet
and
I
think
I'm
being
charitable
here
it's
easy
to
see
the
Democrats
as
picking
off
low
hanging
fruit
They've
been
Bush
haters
for
this
long
so
why
give
up
now
And
why
resist
the
temptation
to
hang
the
Bush
albatross
around
the
GOP's
neck
which
would
seem
to
be
their
trump
card
in
another
down
year
for
Republicans
The
problem
is
that
it
runs
counter
to
some
deeply
ingrained
perceptions
about
McCain
the
most
transparently
un-Bush
candidate
Republicans
could
have
nominated
How
does
one
overlook
the
fact
that
amongst
Republican
primary
voters
most
dissatisfied
with
Bush
McCain
dominated
Or
McCain's
bitter
rivalry
with
the
President
that
lingered
long
beyond
the
2000
election
culminating
in
charges
that
he
threatened
to
leave
the
party
and
now
that
he
didn't
even
vote
for
President
Bush
in
2000
How
does
Arianna's
story
square
with
the
narrative
of
McSame
The
Democrats
have
chosen
to
run
the
same
campaign
against
McCain
as
they
would
have
run
against
Romney
or
Huckabee
This
will
turn
out
to
be
a
strategic
mistake
Why
Because
they
ignore
the
new
media
reality
that
no
amount
of
points
on
television
can
overturn
a
narrative
backed
up
by
the
free
media
The
left's
McSame
campaign
is
an
example
of
the
particularly
crude
communications
tactic
of
countermessaging
Countermessaging
consists
solely
of
challenging
a
prevailing
public
narrative
The
media
is
not
liberal
There
was
no
housing
bubble
Global
warming
is
a
myth
This
tactic
can
be
useful
practiced
by
notoriously
off-message
B
and
C-teamers
running
interference
while
well
behind
the
line
of
scrimmage
the
quarterback
prepares
to
throw
long
The
problem
is
that
this
particularly
uninventive
form
of
McCain
Maverick
Denial
is
the
Democrats
central
strategy
for
discrediting
the
Republican
nominee
Few
people
who
aren't
partisan
Democrats
actually
believe
it
If
you
were
to
ask
undecideds
about
McCain's
comparative
weaknesses
I'm
not
sure
Bush-coziness
would
be
close
to
the
top
of
the
list
in
the
same
way
it
would
be
for
a
more
conventional
Republican
If
we
are
in
an
era
of
authenticity
where
free
media
narratives
reign
then
you're
limited
to
arguing
based
on
a
candidate's
actual
weaknesses
and
strengths
In
a
few
cases
you
can
create
weaknesses
if
you're
operating
in
an
evergreen
space
where
there
are
no
public
perceptions
yet
either
way
Unfortunately
for
David
Brock
et
al
Bush-McCain
tensions
have
been
a
recurring
theme
in
our
collective
political
psyche
for
nearly
a
decade
If
the
left
were
actually
smart
what
would
they
do
to
us
Drive
wedges
between
McCain
and
his
base
by
playing
up
McCain's
ongoing
feuds
with
Bush
and
the
conservative
movement
demoralizing
conservatives
and
keeping
base
turnout
closer
to
1996-2000
levels
as
opposed
to
red-hot
2004
levels
Focus
on
insider
issues
like
the
2000
vote
that
won't
get
much
play
outside
the
respective
party
echo
chambers
limiting
any
fallout
among
true
independents
who
are
a
dwindling
percentage
of
the
electorate
anyway
Remember
that
it's
easier
to
get
4
million
conservatives
not
to
show
up
than
it
is
to
get
2
million
independents
to
switch
Portray
McCain
as
the
fake
Democrat
and
Obama
as
the
real
Democrat
Limit
Bush=McCain
criticisms
to
Iraq
only
where
there
is
already
an
established
public
narrative
of
McCain
being
very
hawkish
and
in
fact
leading
Bush
into
the
surge
And
isn't
Iraq
the
core
of
their
indictment
Why
muddy
it
up
with
domestic
stuff
where
Bush
and
McCain
are
often
night
and
day
If
you
are
going
to
focus
on
Bush-McCain
similarities
always
juxtapose
with
McCain's
past
Bush
opposition
to
make
him
appear
inconsistent
But
publicly
recognize
that
Bush
and
McCain
were
once
opposed
so
you
don't
take
the
credibility
hit
you
would
from
straight-up
McCain
Maverick
Denial
Will
they
pick
up
on
this
Doubtful
To
do
so
would
mean
to
concede
some
Republican
talking
points
to
make
even
more
devastating
anti-McCain
arguments
something
those
like
Brock
who
are
accountable
to
the
netroots
must
never
do
And
countermessaging
is
too
central
to
what
Brock
does
as
the
head
of
Media
Matters
advancing
liberal
media
bias
denial
In
many
ways
the
Bush
2004
definition
of
Kerry
provides
a
useful
contrast
It
was
a
textbook
example
of
a
more
nuanced
message
offensive
that
the
base
wouldn't
have
chosen
It
would
have
been
easy
to
run
a
classic
Kerry
as
Massachusetts
liberal
campaign
Instead
they
tagged
Kerry
as
a
flip-flopper
with
the
goal
of
maximizing
contrasts
with
a
decisive
wartime
President
In
that
year
juxtaposition
and
the
perception
of
incoherence
mattered
more
than
one's
current
or
past
positioning
And
isn't
Hillary
Clinton
the
ultimate
example
of
one's
relationship
to
a
President
not
counting
for
squat
in
a
real-world
election

Introducing
The
Next
Right
by
Patrick
Ruffini
May
7th
2008
2:35
pm
Today
we're
giving
a
sneak
peek
into
something
new
on
the
right
side
of
the
blogosphere
an
online
community
for
change-minded
activists
and
hardcore
political
junkies
in
the
conservative
movement
We're
calling
it
The
Next
Right
We'll
be
launching
in
a
few
weeks
and
you
can
sign
up
to
get
an
email
when
we
do
My
partners
in
this
endeavor
are
already
well
known
to
you
if
you're
a
fan
of
savvy
fact-driven
political
blogging
Jon
Henke
of
QandO
and
recently
a
consultant
to
the
Fred
Thompson
campaign
and
Soren
Dayton
of
RedState
and
Eye
on
08
fame
and
all
too
briefly
of
the
McCain
campaign
Here's
why
we're
doing
this
and
here's
why
it's
different
It's
no
secret
that
the
right
operates
at
a
severe
disadvantage
to
the
left
when
it
comes
to
building
online
political
infrastructure
People
point
to
ActBlue
and
Obama's
massive
fundraising
advantage
but
the
problem
cuts
deeper
netroots
activists
on
the
left
have
built
critical
mass
around
an
idea
that
regular
people
on
the
Internet
can
get
their
hands
dirty
and
remix
Democratic
politics
They
not
only
raise
money
They
recruit
candidates
They
fund
full-time
investigative
journalism
to
ambush
Republicans
They
act
as
a
party
whip
creating
consequences
for
Democrats
who
in
their
view
don't
act
like
Democrats
They
volunteer
and
flock
to
states
with
key
races
The
right
can
build
all
the
tools
it
wants
but
without
a
narrative
and
a
rallying
point
for
action
it
will
be
for
naught
Part
of
the
problem
is
structural
When
the
conservative
blogosphere
first
emerged
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
political
upswing
with
back-to-back-to-back
victories
in
2000
2002
and
2004
Political
activism
wasn't
going
to
be
a
comparative
advantage
for
the
right
online
Most
were
content
just
being
pundits
or
media
critics
This
trend
was
reinforced
by
the
blogosphere's
success
in
scalping
Dan
Rather
part
of
a
series
of
new
media-driven
events
that
arguably
changed
the
trajectory
of
the
2004
election
Ever
since
then
a
radically
different
set
of
circumstances
has
dominated
our
politics
It's
one
that
requires
a
substantially
different
response
one
that
requires
us
to
stop
being
pundits
and
start
being
change
agents
Put
simply
the
party
and
in
many
cases
the
movement
has
lost
its
moorings
Earmarks
exploded
ten-fold
and
it
wasn't
under
a
Democratic
Congress
In
this
winter's
primary
we
saw
the
once
mighty
fiscal-social-national
conservative
coalition
turned
in
on
itself
with
economic
conservatives
pitted
against
social
conservatives
And
too
many
of
the
experts
in
the
Presidential
campaigns
this
cycle
failed
to
modernize
the
way
the
party
does
business
clinging
to
the
old
top-down
rostrums
of
direct
mail
and
fundraising-by-cocktail-party
in
an
increasingly
networked
and
crowdsourced
world
It's
no
wonder
that
Joe
Conservative
outside
the
Beltway
feels
that
none
of
his
self
appointed
leaders
are
listening
to
him
He
looks
to
Washington
and
sees
a
leadership
class
that
is
too
often
arrogant
timid
divided
and
technologically
behind
the
curve
It's
no
wonder
why
this
year
more
than
most
his
wallet
has
been
sealed
shut
when
it
comes
to
supporting
Republican
candidates
even
the
good
ones
We're
calling
the
site
The
Next
Right
because
much
of
this
story
will
be
written
in
the
future
tense
Our
analysis
will
be
as
much
about
looking
ten
and
fifteen
years
down
the
road
as
it
will
be
about
dissecting
the
mechanics
of
the
2008
contest
What
are
the
coalitions
strategies
and
tactics
the
right
needs
to
win
again
How
does
the
party
need
to
change
to
attract
a
generation
of
voters
who
could
very
well
be
lost
to
us
if
we
don't
move
fast
Where
do
we
find
the
candidates
who
will
lead
a
resurgent
right
in
the
2010
and
2012
elections
and
beyond
The
vibrant
discussion
Soren
Jon
and
many
others
had
about
the
future
of
the
movement
last
spring
and
summer
would
be
perfect
fodder
for
this
new
venture
If
you're
looking
for
pure-play
opinion
and
link
bait
on
sundry
topics
from
Ann
Coulter
to
Jimmy
Carter/Hamas
you
won't
find
it
here
What
you
will
find
is
in-depth
often
unabashedly
technical
writing
about
the
election
the
polls
the
strategy
and
the
issues
Our
analysis
will
track
truth
and
stay
true
to
the
numbers
But
it
will
self-consciously
serve
a
greater
purpose
educating
YOU
to
be
your
own
political
strategist
and
start
doing
something
whether
that's
blogging
about
your
local
Congressional
race
or
Democratic
corruption
in
your
state
organizing
fundraising
drives
and
maybe
even
managing
races
or
running
for
office
yourself
Only
a
revival
of
civic
engagement
at
the
grassroots
level
will
create
a
conservative
future
we
want
one
that
is
pork-free
and
robust
in
the
defense
of
our
country
and
its
values
We
can't
call
a
switchboard
and
wait
for
Washington
to
fix
the
mess
We
have
to
do
it
ourselves
from
the
ground
up
in
every
state
In
that
spirit
we're
opening
the
doors
to
anyone
who
wants
to
blog
on
The
Next
Right
Users
will
be
able
to
create
their
own
blogs
on
the
site
an
ability
only
a
handful
of
conservative
sites
offer
today
We're
also
looking
for
a
great
stable
of
front-page
writers
who
can
write
smart
savvy
analysis
on
a
consistent
basis
email
us
if
you
think
you
fit
the
bill
We
want
to
open
this
up
as
much
as
possible
It
can't
just
be
about
the
three
of
us
or
it
will
fail
I'm
pumped
about
this
new
venture
The
last
few
months
have
seen
a
considerable
amount
of
backchannel
discussion
between
the
thought
leaders
about
the
sorry
state
of
online
activism
on
the
right
often
with
great
agreement
on
a
direction
moving
forward
The
good
news
is
that
the
talent
is
there
I've
long
relied
on
Soren
and
Jon
for
high-level
political
analysis
and
by
bringing
it
under
one
roof
and
opening
the
door
to
more
people
we
hope
this
quickly
becomes
a
hub
right-leaning
junkies
like
you
We
don't
think
this
alone
will
solve
the
activism
gap
Anyone
who
tells
you
that
they
alone
have
the
answer
is
fooling
you
This
is
not
the
Daily
Kos
of
the
right
What
we're
hoping
to
do
is
create
momentum
and
an
intellectual
framework
for
action
because
action
ultimately
starts
with
narratives
and
ideas
We
want
grassroots
conservatives
and
libertarians
to
start
believing
that
they
can
make
a
difference
again
a
sense
all
too
many
have
lost
Only
you
and
not
some
well-funded
527
can
bring
the
movement
into
the
future
Only
when
grassroots
conservative
have
a
direct
stake
in
the
future
of
the
party
are
we
effective
The
Next
Right
is
about
creating
a
vision
for
a
21st
century
Republican
Party
and
conservative
movement
On
a
personal
note
you
should
finally
see
me
blogging
more
though
not
at
PatrickRuffini.com
I've
committed
to
moving
all
my
purely
political
content
to
The
Next
Right
and
will
be
setting
up
my
RSS
feed
to
automagically
redirect
you
to
my
writings
there
I'll
still
keep
some
personal
and
tech
stuff
here
but
most
of
my
stuff
will
be
there
We
hope
you'll
join
us
in
taking
the
next
right

Grand
Theft
Auto
Republicans
by
Patrick
Ruffini
April
30th
2008
9:16
pm
Via
Jon
Henke
on
Twitter
this
Google
Trends
chart
for
grand
theft
auto
is
pretty
interesting
Not
only
does
it
show
a
noticeable
uptick
surrounding
the
release
of
GTA
IV
this
week
but
check
out
the
Top
10
states
where
people
are
Googling
the
game
Kentucky
Kansas
Michigan
Wisconsin
South
Carolina
Ohio
Pennsylvania
Missouri
Indiana
and
Oklahoma
These
were
all
Bush
states
in
the
last
election
or
were
tossups
Who
knew
that
Grand
Theft
Auto
fans
skewed
Republican
Last
fall
I
blogged
about
how
free
analytics
data
from
social
sites
around
the
web
in
this
case
Facebook's
advertising
platform
could
be
used
for
behavioral
targeting
If
you
watch
SportsCenter
and
worship
the
Star
Wars
trilogy
you're
probably
a
Republican
and
if
you're
into
Colbert
and
Paris
Hilton
you're
probably
a
Democrat
Though
Facebook
has
since
pulled
its
segmentation
by
ideology
after
its
ill-considered
move
towards
open-ended
political
affiliation
and
we
only
have
geographic
data
to
go
by
in
Google
Trends
this
data
may
gain
more
mainstream
acceptance
since
there
is
no
more
mainstream
action
online
than
Googling
for
something
For
instance
Julie
Germany's
microtargeting
riff
at
SXSW
that
vodka
drinkers
are
Democrats
and
bourbon
drinkers
are
Republicans
is
fully
borne
out
by
Google
Trends
All
ten
of
the
top
vodka
states
are
blue
states
And
eight
of
the
top
ten
bourbon
states
are
red
states
And
I
didn't
need
some
six
figure
study
to
tell
me
that
Combine
the
lean
Republican
nature
of
Grand
Theft
Auto
players
with
the
hard
Republican
tendencies
of
bourbon
drinkers
and
you've
just
microtargeted
bourbon
drinking
gamers
as
solid
Republicans
We
already
knew
from
the
Facebook
dataset
that
the
gaming
community
skews
conservative
Of
course
any
post
titled
like
this
is
bound
to
be
a
little
tongue
in
cheek
More
recent
GTA
adopters
do
tend
to
be
from
bluer
states
as
seen
in
this
April
2008
chart
Other
charts
can
help
quantify
what
we
intuitively
already
know
Check
out
Twitter's
top
cities
San
Fran
Austin
Seattle
Portland
New
York
LA
DC
and
Boston
the
classic
early
adopter
lineup
Ever
since
the
Bush
campaign's
pioneering
use
of
microtargeting
in
the
04
campaign
building
the
perfect
model
for
political
behavior
from
consumer
data
has
been
the
holy
grail
of
politics
The
reams
of
data
that's
only
now
just
surfacing
about
consumers
online
behavior
is
making
it
a
little
easier
allowing
say
a
Congressional
campaign
to
perform
basic
targeting
on
their
TV
and
online
advertising
