How
far
does
the
right
to
free
speech
extend
Can
you
yell
fire
in
a
crowded
theater
Can
you
stand
on
a
street
corner
and
stir
up
a
mob
to
lynch
someone
Can
materials
be
distributed
in
mosques
that
call
for
Jihad
against
Americans
and
incite
terror
and
violence
Can
a
terrorist
organization
troll
for
funding
on
websites
hosted
by
U.S
Internet
providers
In
other
words
does
speech
that
creates
an
imminent
threat
of
danger
trump
the
most
basic
right
we
as
Americans
have
the
right
to
be
safe
in
our
persons
In
the
case
of
materials
found
in
American
mosques
that
call
for
Jihad
the
ideology
of
Jihad
clearly
enunciated
throughout
the
holy
books
of
Islam
has
invariably
and
undeniably
led
to
acts
of
Jihad
Fourteen
hundred
years
of
history
and
270
million
dead
at
the
hands
of
Islamic
Jihad
document
this
cause
and
effect
Jihadist
speech
has
historically
led
to
violence
terror
and
death
It
is
therefore
our
position
that
jihadist
ideology
is
speech
that
poses
an
imminent
threat
of
danger
a
position
supported
by
1,400
years
of
history
Isn?t
it
time
we
exercised
our
right
to
petition
and
demand
that
our
Congress
examine
extremist
materials
in
mosques
so
that
we
can
have
a
truly
informed
public
debate
on
this
issue
If
you
haven?t
yet
exercised
your
First
Amendment
right
to
petition
our
government
for
redress
of
grievances

We

We

brings

You
are

that

Barack

he's
gonna
go
out

campaign
in
57

he
was
just
tired
you
know
it's
been
such
a
long

he's
been
so
many
places
he
probably
thinks
there
are
57
states
Well
there
is
a
website
called
the
International
Humanist

Ethical
Union
And
here
is
how
the
second
paragraph
of
an
article
on
that
website
begins
Every

from
1999
to
2005
the
organization
of

the
57

presented
a

said
he's

it

is
How

did

or
was
this
a
more
telling

Obama's

not

a

Charter

are

by

that

the

The

The

were
corralled

Give

Let
Christians

It

had
an

fight
with

the
public
about
this
situation
we
are

All
a

would
say
is
The
Minnesota
Department
of
Education
goes
to
great
lengths
to
make
clear
to
charter
schools
and
their
sponsors
that
while
schools
should
appropriately
accommodate
students
religious
beliefs
they
must
be
nonsectarian
under
the
state's
charter
school
law
Yet
this
scenario
has
been
going
on
way
too
long
and
should
have
been
shut
down
a
year
ago
Now
more
Islamic-oriented
schools
are
springing
up
here
at
the
expense
of
Minnesota
citizens
A
school
like
this
is
likely
coming
to
a
neighborhood
near
you
It
will
thrive
unless
you
as
a
taxpayer
blow
the
whistle
and
demand
action
against
these
outfits
The
leader
of
the
one
being
reported
on

the

Cities
suburb
was
challenged
about
not
flying
the
American
flag
He
said
he
didn't
know
how
to

pole
As
long
as
we
continue
to
look
the
other
way
Islamic
charter
public
schools
will
start
to
flourish
in
America
and
you
will
pay
for
it
Contact
your
educational
authorities
And
you
can
bet
in
their
prayer
time
they
are
not
saying
the
Lord's
Prayer
They
are
not
pledging
allegiance
to
the
American
flag
But
they
are
serving
halal
food
and
doing
ritual
washings

The

look
forward

Editor's
note
We
need
to
realize
that
we
are
speaking
of
radical
Islam
There
are
questions
you
can
ask
to
determine
the
kind
of
Muslim
you
are
speaking
to
We
will
note
these
in
Class
201
Islam
is
not
a
religion
nor
is
it
a
cult
It
is
a
complete
system
Islam
has
religious
legal
political
economic
and
military
components
The
religious
component
is
a
beard
for
all
the
other
components
Islamization
occurs
when
there
are
sufficient
Muslims
in
a
country
to
agitate
for
their
so-called
religious
rights
When
politically
correct
and
culturally
diverse
societies
agree
to
the
reasonable
Muslim
demands
for
their
religious
rights
they
also
get
the
other
components
under
the
table
Here's
how
it
works

As

not

that
in

such
as

at

Therefore
they
exercise

than

average
would
indicate
